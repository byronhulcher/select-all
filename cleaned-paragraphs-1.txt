Other widely shared articles:
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were well-informed about Mueller’s request for a grand jury and its implications. This meant that the probe reached well beyond Flynn and into whether Russians actually interfered in the election, and empanelling a grand jury gave Mueller the power to subpoena documents and call witnesses. The Dallas Morning News also had a rare viral hit when it published a column detailing millions in campaign contributions by Ukrainian-born billionaire Len Blavatnik to the PACs of various lead Republicans.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You believed that the Comey testimony was, as the president himself said, total vindication of Trump. If you’re wondering where all of the Comey coverage was this week, it was mostly in this bubble, which took the largely non-revelatory testimony as evidence that Trump had done no wrong. Elsewhere in this bubble, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch became a new focus of widespread anger, probably because Trump tweeted that she should have been investigated.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You wondered what this breach of conduct could mean for Trump’s presidency. As in the more liberal bubbles, stories making fun of Trump and emphasizing the outlandishness of his claim were heavily shared. But the biggest story in this bubble suggested that Trump’s claim, if false, could constitute a major scandal and pave the way to his impeachment.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were following the many paths Mueller’s investigation was taking since he’d been granted a grand jury. The top story in this bubble was a CNN report that Mueller’s probe had widened its scope beyond election meddling to investigate financial ties between Trump associates and Russia. It was also revealed that Mueller’s investigators had asked the White House for documents pertaining to Flynn and were looking into whether he was paid by the Turkish government while advising Trump’s campaign. CNN also reported that the probe had subpoenaed documents pertaining to Don Jr.’s meeting with the Russians about Hillary Clinton.
If you only got your news from this bubble: More than anything, you were sure that Jared Kushner was going to get arrested. The biggest news in this bubble wasn’t Mueller’s appointment at all, but the news that Kushner had been named a “person of interest” — which was, of course, treated by this group of publications as proof positive that Kushner was guilty of, well, something. (The other viral story in this bubble? Pieces aggregating Time magazine’s illustrated D.C.–as–St. Basil’s cover.)
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were exhausted. In a news-heavy week, the publications in this bubble were by far the most shared, thanks both to the huge importance of the stories — but also to their natural narrative tension and drama, which didn’t require much fluffing to find big audiences on Facebook.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were less interested in Comey’s testimony (and Trump’s reaction) than you were in Sessions’s. While recaps and livestreams of Comey’s testimony were popular in this bubble, Sessions’s testimony provided way more grist for the viral mill — in part because Comey’s testimony was covering events that had already been reported, and in part because, well, he’s just a more fun villain to this audience than Comey is a hero.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You knew that WikiLeaks had been in contact with Don Jr. for months, and that Jared Kushner had also received emails about WikiLeaks in the run-up to the election. Politico reported that Kushner had initially failed to disclose these communications to the Senate Judiciary Committee, prompting questions about what he knew and when. Also popular was a BuzzFeed story about the FBI’s investigation into 60 wire transfers from the Russian Foreign Ministry to various embassies, and which contained a suspicious memo line: “to finance election campaign of 2016.”
If you only got your news from this bubble: You also thought Congress was onto something, but wondered whether they’d be able to handle it. After Nunes’s claims of surveillance (and a resulting fight with Schiff), Senator McCain justified his call for a special investigation by questioning the credibility of congressional democrats. A GQ story wondering if the Russia stuff “might be the biggest conspiracy in our nation’s history” was also a big hit in this bubble.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You weren’t happy with Jeff Sessions. Not much broke through among publications with a mostly Republican audience this week, but the stories that did — a Journal scoop about Sessions using political campaign funds to fly to his meeting with Kislyak, and a Hill post quoting Democrat Elijah Cummings demanding Sessions’s resignation — were critical of Sessions, and didn’t at all touch on the hyperconservative meme that Nancy Pelosi had also met with Kislyak.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were, more than anything, interested in the possibility of a Russian cyberattack. To the extent that any stories from this bubble were widely shared (which is no great extent), they focused mostly on news of a possible election hack; interestingly, the same was true of publications with slightly more Democratic audiences, just on the other side of the dividing line.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were dancing in the end zone. On Facebook, this bubble was dominated by super cuts of Trump-administration officials saying the campaign had no connection to the Russian government, and by memes that prominently featured the word “treason.” Most of the actual writing was left to the publications with less-partisan audiences, which had plenty to write and report on.
If you only got your news from this bubble: Comey … who? Comey’s firing wasn’t touched upon at all by these publications, which were largely focused on a video of Condoleezza Rice on The View saying that the legitimacy of the election wasn’t in question. Meanwhile, the Gateway Pundit uncovered another thread in the great Russia conspiracy: Democratic Senator Mark Warner owns stock in a Russian search engine.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were well-informed about the details of Flynn’s indictment and plea deal. The New York Times also reported that Jared Kushner may have directed Flynn to initiate one of his conversations with Kislyak, while ABC News reported that Flynn was prepared to testify that he was directed by Trump himself to make contact with the Russians to plan working together to defeat ISIS in Syria.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You knew that three of Trump’s associates had been indicted, and that the investigation was even wider than previously thought. You were also delighted by a CNN story detailing the misery Fox News staffers felt over their employer’s decision to cover just about anything else other than the Mueller charges.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You weren’t necessarily aware of the Sessions-Kislyak meeting. Publications in this bubble were, interestingly enough, more focused on broad looks at Russia-Trump connections — and forward momentum on investigations — than they were in the specific story of the Kislyak meetings, and the biggest story from this group was a conspiratorial HuffPost piece that vaguely connected the Keystone Pipeline to Trump to Putin.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were well-informed about the Flynn deal, as well as the fact that it wasn’t quite a deal yet. The Wall Street Journal report that broke the story made it clear that no one really knew what Flynn had to offer investigators, or even whether anyone would take him up on his offer in exchange for immunity.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were shocked and appalled by Trump’s decision to fire Comey. As usual for a breaking-news-heavy week, it was the straight news from publications with slightly more Republican audiences that got the most attention and was most widely shared — with the exception of a Forbes article from an outside “contributor” (the publication’s term for the nonemployee writers who fill out the site) with a decidedly anti-Trump slant.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You knew that there was no evidence for Trump’s claim, but you also got more context about the brewing tensions between Trump and the FBI. On Sunday, the New York Times reported that Comey had been pressuring the Justice Department to deny Trump’s claim, but declined to issue his own statement.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You recognized that the Russia investigation was wide, serious, and not looking good for Trump. Publications in this bubble — including wire services Reuters and McClatchy, which generally appear rarely among the most-shared stories — broke news about aspects of the Russia story beyond just the appointment of Mueller and McCarthy’s comments, and painted maybe the most detailed picture of the state of the investigation.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were well-appraised of the status of the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign … but maybe more interested in an impolitic, and possibly joking, comment that former House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy made privately in 2016. The Post’s scoop about McCarthy saying he thinks “Putin pays” Trump was the most shared story of the week, beating out all breaking news, even that of Mueller’s appointment.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were nervous about Trump’s impulses. Stories in this bubble this week covered Trump’s surprising outburst over Sessions’s recusal, and what was apparently growing discussion in the White House over how it could control or block the Mueller investigation — up to and including pardoning people who might eventually be charged by Mueller.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were mostly celebrating what felt like an early victory against Trump. On Facebook, this bubble was flooded with memes about Flynn’s regular campaign chant “lock her up,” and the most shared post was a cathartic rant from Shep Smith about Trump’s treatment of the media. The good feeling also meant pushing for more: An NBC story reporting that Pence had been informed of Flynn’s lying on February 9 was aggressively repackaged by (who else?) Occupy Democrats as evidence that Pence was “implicated” — not in a crime, as the headline might suggest, just in showing that Pence is “just as much of a hypocrite as the rest of the false patriots in the Republican Party.”
If you only got your news from this bubble: Comey’s testimony was low on your list of important stories this week. Publications from this bubble, like their more partisan-directed peers, found bigger audiences with stories about Jeff Sessions, Trump lawyer Christopher Wray, and Russian hackers, whose efforts during the last election, Bloomberg reported, were more widespread than had been previously believed. Comey’s testimony, set up as a blockbuster news event, just didn’t bring enough new information to outpace these other stories.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You thought Trump was probably the victim of a conspiracy. Publications in this bubble looked for ways to bolster Trump’s claim, and some picked up WikiLeaks’s tweet about Obama wiretapping his enemies through PRISM, suggesting that he was capable of doing the same to Donald Trump. Other stories, including one from the Gateway Pundit, tried to rope in former Attorney General and longtime Republican bête noire Loretta Lynch, who would have signed off on a FISA warrant if one existed.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You knew that Trump Jr. had met with a Russian lawyer — and you knew that either he was set up (according to Hannity), or it didn’t matter because Obama administration officials had met with this lawyer, too, and by the ancient legal doctrine of “samesies,” that meant that Don Jr. had done nothing wrong.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were wondering why Republicans weren’t more angry about Trump’s behavior. As was often the case for this bubble, stories that broke through concentrated on the processes of the Mueller investigation, and in particular, wishful-thinking stories about Republicans like Jeb Bush calling for more GOP attention to the investigation.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You knew that Comey had confirmed the existence of an FBI investigation, and that the agency had been looking into the Trump campaign since July. You also paid close attention to House Intelligence chairman Devin Nunes’s claim, two days after Comey’s testimony, that the Trump transition team had been surveilled, which you saw as a potential boon to the investigation, rather than proof of Trump’s wiretapping claim, as Nunes may have hoped.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You had no idea what Don and WikiLeaks were getting up to. Breitbart seized on a Fox News segment in which the author of Clinton Cash claimed that there were audio recordings of Russian officials saying they were willing to use bribery, including donations to the Clinton Foundation, to get favors. Never mind that this didn’t mean anything about the Clintons; it still beat out any mention of WikiLeaks’s direct attempts to influence the U.S. election. What little Fox News did mention about the messages emphasized that Don Jr. released them himself after The Atlantic story.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You cared about the Flynn story insofar as it could take down Trump or Pence. The top story in this bubble was the Daily Beast’s aggregation of an ABC News report that claimed Trump himself had asked Flynn to make contact with the Russians, and a Mother Jones story implicating Pence was also popular.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were split between hoping for a bipartisan investigation and being frustrated that Democratic lobbyists’ ties to Russia were going ignored. Forbes, whose articles rarely go viral, had a huge hit with a post attempting to connect Democratic lobbying groups to Russian interests, but this bubble’s other publications were more interested in Republicans like Roy Blunt calling for a bipartisan investigation into the president.
If you only got your news from this bubble: News of the indictments got through to you, but you were still focused, as usual, on what the Dems were doing. The top story in this bubble, from Fox News, emphasized the fact that the Manafort and Gates charges were essentially about taxes, not collusion, and focused attention instead on the “real story”: the DNC’s funding of the Steele dossier. Right-leaning publications were also giddy over the news that one of the biggest Trump protests of the last year was organized by Russian operatives on Facebook.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You knew that collusion between the Democrats and Russia extended not just to beloved Democratic representative Maxine Waters, but to non-Democrat Robert Mueller, who — as Truth and Action and the Gateway Pundit both reported, going off of emails spotlighted by WikiLeaks — once delivered recovered stolen uranium to Russia. How deep does this thing go?!
If you only got your news from this bubble: You’d know that the Russian ambassador had met with President Obama and several Democratic senators. In some ways, the heavily conservative publications of this bubble got more play off of the Kislyak story than publications with more liberal audiences — no story is better to the highly Republican quadrant of publishers than one about Democrats acting (imagine serious scare quotes) hypocritical, or even better, actively misspeaking, as Nancy Pelosi did when she said she’d never met Kislyak.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were into the news about Mueller’s probe, but you were more excited by other signs of conspiracy. Publications in this bubble claimed that West Virginia governor Jim Justice’s switch from Democrat to Republican was explained by the millions in taxes that he owes after a deal with a Russian coal company. A post from the Palmer Report found it meaningful that on the same day a Russian oligarch landed at Newark, Trump happened to fly into Bedminster, New Jersey, 30 miles away.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You weren’t thinking much about the Russia investigation at all. Without a single story dominating the news in other bubbles, the publications with highly Republican audiences found little success in particular — except, of course, in the kind of regular what-about-Obama and even-Schumer-says chum that remains their stock-in-trade.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You’d know that the real story is, of course, Hillary Clinton’s ties to Russia. Flynn barely appeared in stories seen by highly Republican sharers this week: The focus was, instead, on the real Russia story, which is, of course, that Hillary Clinton allowed a Canadian mining company to be sold to a Russian energy company, handing over uranium stores to Russia and, the story goes, personally enriching the secretary and her husband. Not to be outdone, the Gateway Pundit reached even further back for the real real Russia story, which is that in 1984, Ted Kennedy “asked Russia to intervene” to “beat Reagan.” “Mainstream Media Definitely will NOT show this,” the Gateway Pundit wrote, and, well, factually, it was correct.
And that’s when NPM’s governing body got involved. They have a policy in place for naming disputes such as this. In their own blog post recounting the incident, CEO Isaac Schlueter wrote:
In disputes like this, packages are normally altered in such a way that existing programs using the dependencies can still find them without needing to be altered themselves, but instead Koçulu decided to simply remove all of his nearly 300 packages from NPM, breaking tons of other software in the process.
In a blog post announcing the move, he wrote:
Among the software removed was a package known as left-pad, 11 lines of code comprising a function that adds extra space to the left side of a string of text.
Here it is in its entirety:
That’s it. But a lot of other software relied on left-pad to work. “Shortly after 2:30 PM (Pacific Time) on Tuesday, March 22, we began observing hundreds of failures per minute, as dependent projects — and their dependents, and their dependents … — all failed when requesting the now-unpublished package,” Schlueter recounted.
Because the code was open-source, another coder republished an identical, new version (1.0.0) within minutes. That version number was another problem, though. Though it’s not required, dependency requests can specify the software version number, and many of them specifically requested Koçulu’s old 0.0.3 version. So NPM had to take the “unprecedented” step of republishing it via backup. The issue, by their account, lasted two and a half hours.
Earlier this week, a messy situation putting open-source software at odds with trademark ownership impaired the functions of thousands of pieces of software, demonstrating the dangers of relying on third-party code for important software. Large companies including Facebook, Netflix, and Spotify were briefly affected.
There are other lingering effects of the disruption. The exodus vacated hundreds of package names that others are now free to use, so if existing software calls for one of Koçulu’s old packages, it could have been replaced with an entirely different program. Developers might not know what code they’re executing. Many of the package names are already being squatted on.
Other developers are using the incident as an opportunity to call out lazy programmers, relying on external dependencies that are really just single functions. In a post about the incident, Stack Overflow employee David Haney wrote about the disfunction of NPM as a whole, saying, “It feels to me as if the entire job of an NPM-participating developer is writing the smallest amount of code possible to string existing library calls together in order to create something new that functions uniquely for their personal or business need.”
What the incident serves to highlight is how, for all the good that open source does, its highly malleable state also turns it into a delicate house of cards, in which one missing dependency can cause a cascading effect that reaches some of the largest services on the web.
In this case, the drama surrounded NPM (short for “node package manager”), the default manager for node.js, a runtime environment popular with web developers. NPM is used to install open-source software, collected into packages. In turn, developers can call upon that software, known as dependencies, to perform functions, eliminating the need to code from scratch. If a dependency disappears from NPM, it has the potential to break the software calling upon it, creating a domino effect. NPM is hardly the only system that works like this. The web is basically built upon an interweaving of different systems and software libraries that call upon each other to work together all the time.
For the past couple of weeks, a developer named Azer Koçulu has been in a dispute with messenger service Kik over his use of the name “kik” for one of his packages. Koçulu, an adamant proponent of open-source software, refused to change the name or yield to a corporate interest.
In a blog post about the dispute, Kik employee Mike Roberts reprinted emails between Koçulu and another Kik rep, Bob Stratton.
Stratton wrote on March 11:
Koçulu responded just over an hour later:
Everyone was very chill about the goat on the train. “A goat! Didn’t expect to see a goat on the train but there it is. What a world!” That’s what I think everyone on the train with Turbo said.
Finally, Turbo arrived at Toronto’s Union Station. The crowd went nuts. The paparazzi loved him.
Later, Turbo made his way to the Fairmont Royal York hotel.
But there was no time to stop! Turbo had an important meeting with the politicians and bigwigs at City Hall. He even met with Toronto City Councillor Norm Kelly, who banned Meek Mill from Toronto and whom teens adore.
This morning, a goat named Turbo made Canadian history when he became the first of his species to ride Ontario public transportation. Turbo is on his way to the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair in Toronto and his media tour is going very well.
Then Turbo went on TV!
Turbo then rode a Toronto streetcar for the first time.
Turbo has just arrived at the Royal Winter Fair!!! Phenomenal. Best of luck to you, Turbo.
Turbo just got a ticket for public urination. C’mon, Turbo … the eyes of the world are upon you.
This is Canadian history in the making. We will keep you updated on Turbo’s amazing journey.
Yesterday, Turbo got ready for his big day.
Turbo showed up at the GO station in Port Credit shortly before seven this morning, ready for his journey to the big city.
The press is going nuts for this dang goat. It’s a goat on the train. That’s crazy! Normally, humans ride the train, but this time, it was goat. I love Turbo.
This is all very good, but part of the genius of Kanye is that mocking Kanye only makes him stronger. Remember that “I love you like Kanye loves Kanye” meme? It’s not even a joke anymore; it’s now a line on his new album.
On Thursday, Kanye West debuted the greatest album of all time, The Life of Pablo, at his Yeezy Season 3 fashion show at Madison Square Garden. His performance left everyone with the same lingering question: When’s someone going to make a website that lets you generate your own TLOP cover? Let me clear that up for you right now: It already happened, and it’s called the Pablo Dot Life.

🆕🆕🆕 Made a @kanyewest TLOP album art generator with @wjosephflynn and @drewhamlin today! https://t.co/JP6l9pOB1L pic.twitter.com/PtzRCGoRlT — Andy Chung (@_andychung) February 12, 2016
Enter some text, pick a photo, and you’ve got your own re-creation of the instantly iconic orange cover by Tumblr-influenced Belgian artist Peter de Potter. Is the cover actually good, or is it terrible?
Opinions are … mixed.
The truth is, it almost doesn’t matter because — like everything Kanye does — it’s memorable.
So far, most people seem to be making TLOP covers about their own lives, but the Pablo Dot Life has higher, funnier uses:
I, and the parents of many preschoolers, will tell you that Thrash ‘N’ Trash can be a lifesaver in situations like long plane rides. But Erdman’s audience isn’t only toddlers and their relieved parents. While small children make up a large part of the audience for Thrash ‘N’ Trash and its peers, Erdman was happy to tell me that plenty of clicks come from the sizable community he refers to as “online trash enthusiasts.” That is, retired and current waste-industry workers, as well as foreign viewers curious about U.S. garbage collection methods.
And watching “Garbage Trucks: On Route, In Action!” you can see why his videos are so beloved by garbage-truck enthusiasts of all ages: Erdman has a gift for clean framing and well-lit staging. Unlike most of the other highly viewed channels of garbage-truck YouTube, which are produced by companies looking to exploit young children’s well-documented obsession with garbage trucks, Erdman’s Thrash ‘n’ Trash comes from an authentic love of garbage trucks, one that you can almost sense in his videos. (“Some of my earliest childhood memories are of sitting with my face glued to the front window, sometimes for hours on end, eagerly waiting for the garbage truck to roll down my street,” he writes on his Flickr page.) Like a great natural photographer or documentarian, he knows that his cinematography should only ever serve his subject; he lets his camera gape at the trucks in long, static, lingering takes.
While so many videos that find their way to popularity on YouTube will see their rise, their peak, their attendant spinoffs, and finally, their descent from public consciousness all within the space of a week, garbage-truck content is satisfyingly evergreen. And to consider that Bryn Erdman has been cultivating the same online brand since he was a teenager, dedicating himself to the singular task of documenting waste collection with a heavy-metal twist, is to behold an impressively masterful handling of the niche internet.
Still, Erdman isn’t resting on his archives. By now he has filmed garbage trucks on route in Washington, Oregon, California, and Idaho, but he told me about his big dreams: “My ultimate goal is to film garbage trucks in all 50 states!”
Until that dream is realized, he will continue to chase rare footage of local trucks, like the elusive commercial front loader that he caught earlier this month “slamming back some dumpsters around town,” much to the delight of his fans. These are the people he braves all climates and shooting conditions for — the garbage enthusiasts of all ages who harbor what even Erdman admits is a “rather unique interest” in waste management.
Embedded below this paragraph is a masterpiece of garbage-truck YouTube: “Garbage Trucks: On Route, In Action!” It’s the work of the 21-year-old man pictured above: Bryn Erdman. Opening with a heavy-metal guitar riff (written and recorded by Erdman), the video features a 19-minute compilation (shot by Erdman) of the front loaders, side loaders. and curb-sort recyclers that manage waste throughout the Pacific Northwest. The video has been viewed over 1.8 million times — no surprise, as it was created after multiple fan requests. The reviews in the comments are rapturous: “This is the kind of video which dominates all the other garbage truck videos out there; it’s a king production,” says MitchellM15. “Well this was a joy. thanks for finally uploading one of the WM Portland recycling Labries!!” writes Trashman242.
I may not have the same level of connoisseurship as Trashman242, but I am certainly thankful for Erdman’s videos. I first came to his channel, Thrash ‘N’ Trash, by way of my now-2-year-old son, whose fascination with the weekly appearance of our neighborhood trash truck needed to be supplemented with the kind of on-demand trash-truck action I figured I might find on YouTube. And it completely won me over after he quietly watched “Garbage Trucks: On Route, In Action!” on a loop for the better part of a transatlantic flight this summer.
Through his Thrash ‘N’ Trash oeuvre, Erdman has managed to tap into the dual veins that circulate contentment through a family home: toddlers’ utter fascination with trash trucks, and their parents’ equally enthusiastic desire to pacify their kids with inoffensive content. For my preschool-age viewer, the footage represents a greatest-hits montage of the machines that enthrall him. For a parent like me, the video is a mesmerizing and oddly soothing tour of the various nondescript residential communities sprawled across the region, each distinguishable only by the colors of its curbside trash barrels and their adjacent lawns.
In midsummer 2008, at the same time that a 14-year-old Justin Bieber was uploading videos of himself singing to his YouTube account, Erdman, also 14, was uploading amateur videos, under the username TrashMonkey22, that featured play-by-play footage of local garbage trucks on route, set to soundtracks of heavy-metal hits by the likes of Black Sabbath and the extreme metal band Carcass.
Seven years later, Bieber is an international pop sensation at age 21. But Erdman — now a young husband and new father, residing in southwestern Washington — embodies a more attainable though no less admirable version of the 2015 American dream. His YouTube channel Thrash ‘N’ Trash Productions, so named for the thrash metal that Erdman favors, has recently begun to generate enough income through ad revenue for him to turn his full professional attention to documenting waste management.
Nobody is more surprised than Erdman himself, who joined YouTube as a mere garbage hobbyist. “When I first started my channel,” he told me, “I never expected it to be even remotely life changing.”
Now with a total of more than 31 million views across the over 300 videos he has produced since 2008, the channel has not only allowed him to provide a modest living for his young family but also made him a major player in the greater garbage-truck YouTube genre, where documenting the collection, transportation, and disposal of garbage is no casual business. Erdman has invested thousands of dollars into the equipment needed to achieve the professional-level production value his videos have come to be known for. This, in addition to the time and resources he has dedicated to necessary travel. He also meticulously hand-builds customized model garbage trucks to feature in the popular videos he creates for fans of miniatures, one of which has earned nearly 6 million views.
A couple of years ago, documents obtained by national security whistle-blower Edward Snowden and published by the Intercept revealed that the U.S. National Security Agency is collecting metadata from a huge number of cellular phones in Pakistan. The program, cheekily called SKYNET after the humanity-destroying artificial intelligence from the Terminator franchise, tracks movements and known associates, then an algorithm analyzes all that Big Data and flags potential terrorists to be targeted for drone strikes. The problem is, a data expert told Ars Technica this week, that algorithm is “completely bullshit.”
Patrick Ball, a data scientist and Ph.D. who directs the Human Rights Data Analysis Group, says fundamental flaws in SKYNET’s methodology may be causing thousands of innocents to be falsely identified as terrorists.
The technical details are spelled out at Ars, but the gist of Ball’s argument is that for a machine to effectively identify a terrorist, it needs known terrorists as input. But there just aren’t that many known terrorists, especially in comparison to the number of phones the NSA is monitoring in Pakistan — at least 55 million.
According to Ball and to documents published by the Intercept, the NSA’s pool of known terrorists is seven. They apparently trained the algorithm by “feeding it six of the terrorists and tasking SKYNET to find the seventh” among a random group of 100,000 citizens, Ars reports.
But Ball says this doesn’t work, because the terrorist cluster is so small and densely connected that it always sticks out from the bigger group. To be truly accurate, the NSA would have to mix all the terrorists into the population before choosing the random sample of 100,000 — but they can’t, because they just don’t have enough terrorists.
As a result, Ball says, SKYNET’s reported numbers for false positives are “ridiculously optimistic.” And optimistically, the NSA reports a 0.008 percent false-positive rate, which represents 15,000 people who could have been mislabeled as terrorists and potentially targeted for assassination by drone. (Thus far, as many as 4,000 Pakistani civilians have been reported killed in drone strikes.)
Big Data being used to show you ads or recommend friends can certainly feel intrusive, but when Facebook gets it wrong, the worst consequence is that icky, uncanny valley feeling. But that’s nothing compared to what can happen when machine learning goes wrong for a military-intelligence app in Pakistan. It can literally be life or death.
Late last night, beloved Twitter comedian Kanye West tweeted out a screenshot from his (?) computer, showing an open YouTube page featuring a Sufjan Stevens song. Also open? Several tabs — including the official site for the music plug-in Serum, the infamous Swedish torrent site Pirate Bay, and a host of pop-ups familiar to anyone who’s browsed to the shadier corners of the internet.
Stars — they’re just like us! Who among us has not released an album solely on a struggling streaming network launched by their mentor, refused to sell it in more traditional ways, become “difficult to be around” after said album was illicitly downloaded some 500,000 times the day it was released, threatened to sue the world’s largest torrenting site for hosting the album, later tried to purchase a synth plug-in before deciding $189 is too expensive (when you’re $53 million in debt, everything is) and to torrent it, tweeted a baffling, unrelated picture of their browser window while listening to some Suf without realizing the tab from that same torrent site is still open, and then been castigated by the whole internet and Deadmau5?
Get your bodies ready: Jeremy Meeks, a.k.a. Hot Convict, is being released from prison today.
The felon first went viral in 2014 for managing to be both sexually attractive and guilty of carrying a loaded firearm at the same time. The meme was born when the Stockton, California, police department uploaded his mugshot to their Facebook page (criminal justice in the age of social media is both punitive and engaging!), and the horny people of the ‘net took notice. Meeks briefly popped up in the news again in 2015, when Santa Monica agency Blaze Modelz offered him a $30,000 modeling contract, but for the most part he’s kept a low profile during his two-year sentence.
Meeks says he’s mostly excited to spend time with his kids and get back into aqua-sports (literal same), but when you think about it, this guy went into jail a career criminal and is walking out a suburban California model with an inbox full of nudes. He’s living the dream.
The two didn’t know each other at first, but Bastien says they’re now friends on Instagram. He also commended @livesosa for leaving the image up, regardless of mathematical error, because the sentiment that it conveys — helping the less fortunate — is the most important part. (Both Bastien and @livesosa have since re-posted the meme overlaid with Steve Harvey’s face, a reference to Harvey’s enormous error at the Miss Universe pageant last month.)
The image was in some sense a perfect meme: a simple, charming, universal sentiment that could take advantage of the fungibility of truth on social media (it’s not so much that people didn’t realize the equation was wrong — it’s that they didn’t care), but also one that could be singled out and fact-checked by social media’s many superior nitpickers.
Bastien echoed the former sentiment when asked about the upcoming drawing — he copped to chipping in to his office pool. “The Powerball would have been nice to win,” he admitted, “but I’m truly blessed and fortunate enough to give back. I don’t NEED or HAVE TO BE a millionaire. … We all should make an effort every day to reach out to the least fortunate.”
When Steve Bastien started working on his latest image macro, he had no idea it would be an enormous viral success. Then again, he also didn’t know it would be embarrassingly wrong. “I wasn’t even aware if the math was correct at the time,” Bastien, a Coney Island guy who works in HR and in his spare time does graphic design and music production, told me over email. “The thought seemed very profound, and it was a great topic of conversation.”
If you’ve logged on to Facebook at all this week, you’ve probably seen the “thought.” It’s explained in an image of a chalkboard on which a simple equation is written: If the Powerball winner split the $1.3 billion jackpot across the entire United States, every person would get $4.33 million — ending poverty.
As has since been pointed out, it’s not quite that easy. If the equation were solved correctly, it would leave everyone with $4.33 each, not $4.33 million.
The idea for the equation initially came from a Facebook discussion that also involved Bastien’s close friend Philipe Andolini, credited at the bottom of the viral image (Bastien may have been the author of the year’s wrongest meme, but he isn’t credited in the most widely shared version of the image — more on that in a minute).
​Bastien initially re-posted it on Facebook as a quote from his friend, because he didn’t want to steal Andolini’s idea. “When he made the statement the Powerball was at $800–900 million but was growing. So I took it upon myself to make the quote relevant to the actual value, but kept the theory behind the equation.”
From there, Bastien posted the image on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, in the hopes it would pick up some momentum. It did, but not the way he’d expected. “I realized that post was wrong when my friend Jameson commented that it was wrong, then others started commenting. I took the meme down to save face, but people online are crafty and fast.”
“People,” in this case, being a Facebook account called @livesosa, which picked up the image, pasted its handle over Bastien’s, and shared it. This was the version that really went viral, to the tune of 1.3 million shares. Bastien, perhaps happy to let someone share credit for his math error, remains copacetic. “I started seeing more and more people re-post the version with ‘@livesosa’ in the middle instead of mine. It didn’t bother me,” he said. “I am flattered that someone found something I did good enough to take it and make it their own. Good content is meant to be shared.”
California’s insurance commissioner has since opened an investigation into the company’s compliance issues, and whether its salespeople were legitimately licensed.
And the controversial macro apparently wasn’t the only shortcut Zenefits took to speed its expansion and make more sales. Two former employees told BuzzFeed that salespeople were encouraged to achieve only the minimal passing grade — 60 percent — on the state brokerage exam. Studying for anything higher was considered a waste of time.
“D for done,” was the motto among managers at the company, those employees said.
Apparently, this all worked extremely well — until it didn’t. BuzzFeed describes a rapid-fire, fast-paced sales environment where office drinking was common and big scores were celebrated with booze, in terms that bring to mind journalists’ accounts of Washington Mutual’s loan department just before the housing bubble burst in 2007.
But once the sales were made, customers weren’t especially happy with Zenefits. It turns out that the automated process of signing up for insurance only appeared to be automated. Behind the scenes, a large number of employees manually did all the data entry for clients, keeping up an expensive Silicon Valley illusion.
“The back office is really heavy in terms of bodies,” a former Zenefits employee told BuzzFeed. “It’s really archaic. It just seems automatic to the customer.”
“Most health insurance carriers and several payroll service providers, including ADP, have no automatic link to the Zenefits system,” BuzzFeed added.
The great disruption really wasn’t.
The Wall Street Journal’s coverage of the story suggests the fall of Zenefits — which was valued at $4.5 billion last May, and marked down to $2.3 billion in September — can be attributed to its environment, the “move fast and break things” culture of post-Facebook Silicon Valley.
Zenefits’ problems were caused by intense pressure to “hit ambitious revenue targets and to retain employees,” justifying its high valuation, the Journal reports.
The Holy Grail of Silicon Valley start-ups, the truly special “unicorn” into which investors want to dump millions of their dollars in hopes of making billions, is a company that promises to overturn an entire industry’s way of doing business. But the game plan of replacing people with a combination of software and different people (who get paid less) is much harder to execute when the business you want to disrupt is heavily regulated. According to a revelatory BuzzFeed report, Zenefits — which aimed to revolutionize the insurance and human resources businesses — just found that out the hard way.
But the new CEO, Sacks — a former PayPal and Yammer exec and self-described “hypergrowth addict” — isn’t discussing the problems in terms of the constant pressure for ever-greater growth. He’s just blaming them on the old guy, Parker Conrad, and on those pesky industry regulations.
This paragraph from the Journal says it all, really:
The saga of Zenefits is truly insane, and yet not at all surprising. Silicon Valley plays by its own rules (or maybe just one rule: growth), and this is what happens when it rubs up against an industry with a more stringent set of regulations. And Zenefits certainly isn’t alone — Uber is actively fighting regulation in the taxicab industry, while Airbnb is ignoring it in the hotel business.
But these regulations all have a purpose, and despite what start-ups would have you think, that purpose is not always “protecting an entrenched industry’s profits from innovators.” Sometimes it’s ensuring employees get paid a fair wage, holding companies accountable for what happens to their customers, or making sure the people selling you insurance actually know what they’re doing.
As long as there’s money to be had by challenging or skirting regulations, the cycle will repeat itself. It can only end when start-ups finally move fast enough and break everything, or decide the payoff for conquering some industries just isn’t worth the headache.
Zenefits is basically a pretty, user-friendly interface that employers can use to complete onerous HR tasks, the most important of which is signing their employees up for insurance. Therefore, the main money-making function of Zenefits, the thing that justified its $4.5 billion valuation and huge investments from firms like Andreesen Horowitz, was getting companies to use the software.
But dealing with the insurance industry meant Zenefits also had to navigate annoying legal regulations that could have slowed down their march toward making billions. Confronted with this problem, BuzzFeed reports, Zenefits solved it in typical Silicon Valley fashion: by using software to get around the regulations. Instead of going through the required 52 hours of training to get California health insurance broker’s licenses, some Zenefits employees used a software “macro” that made it appear like they were logged in while they were actually doing other things.
Here’s BuzzFeed:
When the cheating became apparent last week, Zenefits co-founder Parker Conrad — who, according to BuzzFeed’s sources, actually wrote the macro himself to save time in the company’s early days — was forced to resign.
The new CEO, David Sacks, released a scathing memo condemning the company culture Conrad had created in the name of rapid growth:
Donald Trump’s anti-Muslim rhetoric is so popular that the best-known white-supremacist site on the web, Stormfront, says it’s installing new servers to handle all the traffic the Republican presidential front-runner has generated.
Talking to Politico, Stormfront founder Don Black said Trump’s campaign had reenergized the white-nationalist movement, and Stormfront has the traffic to prove it. He said Stormfront now sees a million unique visitors a month, and traffic spikes 30 to 40 percent whenever Trump makes a controversial statement about minorities.
“Demoralization has been the biggest enemy and Trump is changing all that,” Black said.
Even David Duke, infamous racist politician and former Ku Klux Klan figurehead, agrees Trump has been great for racist movements.
“He’s made it ok to talk about these incredible concerns of European Americans today,” Duke told Politico.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, finding a rare point of agreement with Stormfront, also told Politico that Trump has reenergized hate groups. The civil-rights organization told Politico the bloviating billionaire has been “driving online chatter” among white-power groups.
Perhaps more disturbing are the white supremacists who like Trump’s anti-Mexican, anti-Muslim pronouncements, but feel he hasn’t gone far enough. Banning all Muslim immigration to the U.S. sounds great to them, but they worry Trump doesn’t have the dedication to activate the military and follow through with his plan.
A New York Times/CBS poll released on Thursday shows Trump’s candidacy on the rise. He’s now leading his nearest competitor, Ted Cruz, by about 20 points.
Hardly a basement-dwelling monster. And Poot became a meme shortly after Demi’s stripped-down, un-retouched Vanity Fair shoot, which was intended to cement her confident new persona and strike a blow against body-image issues.
“I went from being in a place where I was suffering from an eating disorder and hating every single inch of my body to now baring my legs and showing more skin in front of the whole world and being proud of my body instead of loathing it,” she said.
But as Time pointed out, the internet has made it difficult, if not impossible, to control their own narratives — even when those narratives are positive and uplifting. Now Poot is the subject of her own makeup tutorials:
It’s not the lesson Lovato was going for, but it’s valuable in its own way: You can control what you put out there, but you can’t control what people do with it. Sometimes you aim for confident and end up with Poot.
Poot Lovato isn’t as famous as her twin sister, pop star Demi Lovato, and she’s had to overcome the adversity of spending the majority of her life in a basement, but Poot has persevered. According to Time magazine, Poot is one of 2015’s most influential fictional characters.
Poot burst forth onto the internet in October as a Tumblr joke about an awkward 2014 photo of Demi, Photoshopped to make her cheeks look bigger and her eyes farther apart. The photo was said to show the first time “Poot” was allowed outside.
And once she was out, she rapidly took on a fictional life outside of her celebrity “sister.” Poot fans created an official Twitter account and a 24-part fanfiction biography, and BuzzFeed dedicated an article to the new star on the occasion of her ascent from the cellar.
But what elevates Poot from unflattering picture of a popular singer to a full-fledged “influential fictional character”?
For Time’s Daniel D’Addario, it’s that the rise of Poot showed “how Internet fandom can redefine celebrities’ carefully groomed images.”
He’s got a point: Demi absolutely hated Poot. She posted and deleted a couple of tweets incensed that a “shitty angle” could make actual “headlines.”
It’s understandable that she’d be upset. Here’s the moment of Poot’s creation, as captured by a real photographer with a real camera:
On the post announcing Max’s birth, Zuckerberg also replied to comments, but they were mostly directed to famous people with that sweet blue “verified” check mark. The first three replies, for example: Melinda Gates, Shakira, and Richard Branson.
On his follow-up post, Zuck started conversing with the normies. If, as the saying goes, “1 Like = 1 Respect,” then what does "1 Zuckerberg Reply" equal? "45 Billion Likes"?
Some of his advice was inspirational, techno-meritocracy stuff.
“12 years ago I was a student [at Harvard, and prior to that, the prestigious Phillips Exeter Academy].”
And then Zuckerberg was met with the internet’s True and Only Challenge: people who are wrong on the internet.
Earlier this week, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive officer of Facebook, announced the birth of his daughter, Max. At the same time, he and his wife announced they would be donating 99 percent of their company shares, worth approximately $45 billion, to charity.
Mark, my dude. Have a seat. You’re never gonna win. Every day, someone is wrong on the internet. Many people are wrong on the internet. You can’t do anything to change their minds (though breaking them off a piece of that sweet, sweet FB $ might go a long way).
Much has been made of the fact that the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is, technically, not a charity; it is a limited liability corporation. A very rich person introducing an unconventional financial structure for their philanthropy caused many to (understandably!) go,
So Zuck posted another status, going into further detail on it. And that’s usually where the story ends for Zuckerberg. He writes a post, hits Enter, and goes back to his vital work catalyzing the Singularity.
Except he didn’t.
Zuck jumped into the comments section. With zeal!
[Extremely human voice.] “I’m replying to comments on the internet!”
Likewise, Microsoft’s penchant for corporate synergy led to other follies. Xbox Live’s PC counterpart, Games for Windows Live, crashed and burned, as did the 360-integrated Zune music store. And over the last few years, slowly but surely, the Xbox 360’s interface has morphed to resemble the Windows 8 Metro UI.
Console generations usually last four or five years, but the 2008 economic crash prolonged the Xbox 360 and PS3’s lifespans indefinitely, making it a static piece of hardware in an industry that prefers rapid iteration. (Already, there’s chatter of both Microsoft and Sony bolstering current console hardware, and Nintendo is close to releasing an entirely new system.) Using an Xbox 360 over the last decade, in retrospect, has provided a front-row seat to the rapid evolution of the home-entertainment industry — digital distribution, streaming video, and micro-transactions chief among the adaptations. That it all happened on a single box is all the more remarkable.
This morning, Microsoft announced that it was ceasing production on the Xbox 360, its popular video-game console. The first Xbox 360s hit shelves more than a decade ago, in November of 2005; since 2013, the model has played second fiddle to the newer Xbox One. And yet it’s survived, its hardware unchanged, since it first debuted. In that sense, it’s kind of an anomaly: The Xbox 360 should not still exist in 2016, but it does, and looking at its trajectory perfectly illustrates the last decade of shifting focus in digital entertainment.
When you buy a set-top box these days, or maybe just a smart TV itself, you expect it to have a few features, like video streaming, or voice control, or smartphone integration — at the very least, it should connect to the internet. You would never buy a game console that didn’t do at least most of these things; these are standard features. Here are the things that you couldn’t do when the Xbox 360 first launched: stream video from cloud services, buy full-price retail games digitally, control it via gesture or voice, or connect it to your smartphone. One of its model configurations had a storage capacity of just 4 gigabytes.
The Xbox 360 was one of the first consoles to have substantial online functionality throughout its system for purposes other than multiplayer. It popularized the concept of digital distribution — that is, downloadable games, rather than purchased discs — in many ways. Programs like the Xbox Live Arcade made people more comfortable with the notion of buying games without actually receiving physical media (in its infancy, Arcade games had a size limit of 50MB, which is crazy-small in retrospect), and, as the decade wore on, the idea of the same game being available simultaneously digitally and on physical discs became commonplace.
But even Microsoft was unprepared for just how crucial online functionality would be for the console. Downloadable content — add-on content released after the initial game — seemed novel in 2005, but is now a core strategy of the video-game industry. The console’s first user interface, referred to as the “blade” interface, proved woefully inadequate for navigating the Xbox Live Marketplace. Buying and downloading digital content was something one did occasionally in 2006, not multiple times every day. That same year, the release model of Lumines Live caused a stir when it was revealed that the game would be sold in sections, not as one full package. That model was a progenitor of the current free-to-play model, giving away the razor and selling the blades, so to speak. Now, the most popular mobile games earn money not from huge up-front prices, but from micro-transactions.
The situation with the blade interface became so untenable that, in 2008, just three years after launching, Microsoft completely redid the interface, calling it the New Xbox Experience, or NXE. At the time, the idea of a completely different operating system, distributed over the internet for free, was a foreign concept (at least, it was to me). The only pieces of tech that needed software upgrades were computers — the idea that the thing sitting under your TV next to the DVD player was capable of the same thing was nuts.
Along with the NXE came another crucial product: Netflix. In July of 2008, Microsoft inked a deal to be the only game console with a Netflix app. This was, at the time, remarkable. A Netflix-specific Roku model existed, but was not well-known, and the Apple TV model on store shelves only served as a set-top box for interfacing with locally stored content on iTunes, not the cloud. The Apple TV wouldn’t support Netflix streaming until a new model was released in 2010. In 2016, pretty much everything with an internet connection runs Netflix. We’re maybe three years from a toilet running Netflix. And that all started with Microsoft making a huge play for the living-room market.
The Xbox 360 also had a video-rental store in 2006, right alongside iTunes, but it had the advantage of being connected to a TV. The first Apple TV with the functionality to buy and rent from iTunes didn’t come along until 2008.
This is not to say that Microsoft hasn’t had a number of missteps. Its Kinect motion-tracking camera was novel at first, but the tech just wasn’t up to snuff. Microsoft tried to force an upgraded version on Xbox One owners, but it’s been quietly put out to pasture. Still, it was hard not to look at the E3 2009 concept demo and not get intrigued.
While the FBI narrowly avoided a legal battle over breaking encryption on the iPhone belonging to San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook, there are still many more questions left unanswered. The bureau has kept mum on how it accessed the phone’s data or even who the third-party was that assisted them. They also have said nothing about whether the data contained on the phone was useful to terrorism investigators in any way.
On Tuesday, FBI Director James Comey said, according to Reuters, “The threshold (for disclosure) is, are we aware of the vulnerability, or did we just buy a tool and don’t have sufficient knowledge of the vulnerability to implicate the process?”
He added that the agency was “close to a resolution” while speaking at a cybersecurity event. Apple itself is still unaware of how the FBI accessed the iPhone 5c (running iOS 9).
The process of determining what to disclose, to whom, and when is all handled under the government’s cumbersomely named Vulnerabilities Equities Process. However, that process might not even apply, should the exploit be discovered and owned by a private company. The method for unlocking the phone seems to belong to the mysterious, reportedly non-U.S. third party.
So, as of right now, an international hacker, or group of hackers, is in possession of a method to unlock thousands of smartphones and Apple has no idea how to patch it, mostly because of federal bureaucracy. Neato.
There’s a lot of terrible, depraved material out there on the internet — porn, gore, and bigotry of every imaginable flavor. And, as the “front page of the internet,” Reddit collects a lot of it, and often tolerates it in the name of free speech. One thing Reddit can’t tolerate, though? Spoilers for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Although the movie doesn’t open everywhere until midnight on Friday, some people have attended premieres and early screenings, and they’ve set out to ruin the movie for everyone else. Moderators of Reddit’s largest movie community report banning “dozens” of users for revealing plot details, and the moderators themselves have all had the movie spoiled for them. Other subreddits are dealing with the same problem — you’d hate to be in charge of r/StarWars right now.
Unfortunate, to be sure, when a small, troll minority intentionally ruins an experience for others. But some are also pointing to an apparent hypocrisy in the Reddit hive mind. Many on the site oppose “trigger warnings,” giving readers a heads-up when a post’s subject matter might trigger past traumas like sexual assault or racial attacks.
These people argue that trigger warnings cater to the easily offended, and are effectively a form of censorship. We shouldn’t protect people from reality, they say — we have to accept that rape really happens.
So it’s especially uncomfortable when the same group demands to be protected from finding out the details of a space fantasy that will likely be the most popular and highest-grossing film of the year. Spoiler warnings? Don’t we have to accept that Han Solo really dies (or whatever — I haven’t seen the movie), as George Lucas and J.J. Abrams have decreed? This film is part of the Star Wars canon, after all. You can’t expect others to protect you from it your whole life.
Making and updating a website from scratch is an annoying hassle. You have to figure out hosting, and servers, and layout, and fonts, and all that garbage; you have to make sure you can handle traffic and are secure against hackers. All of which help explain why a number of small but well-respected websites — including the Awl, the Hairpin, Pacific Standard, and the Black List — have elected to abandon their backends and move to Medium, the publishing platform founded by Twitter founder Ev Williams.
Medium has, in the past, been unable to clearly define whether it was a platform, like Twitter or YouTube, or a publisher (it won an award from the American Society of Magazine Editors earlier this year), or both. The news, announced with great fanfare on Medium today, is a signal that the three-year-old company (thinks it) has figured out what it wants to be. It’s spun off its flagship in-house publication, Matter, into a separate initiative, and announced a curation program of its own to highlight third-party work. Now, it’s focused on bringing in marquee publishers to build their own content on top of its technology. In addition to the sites mentioned above, work from Time Inc., Fortune, and Atlantic Media will start to appear on Medium and the yet-to-launch Bill Simmons site The Ringer will do so as well.
In other words, Medium has now placed its bets firmly on the “platform” side of its bipolar business. It makes sense. Of the many reasons given for the decline of the media establishment, one of the most compelling has been the technological blind spot of many publishing companies, which operate at a slower pace than the portals and social networks that dictate how much traffic they receive. Part of the reason that BuzzFeed — to name the most prominent example — ate everyone else’s lunch so quickly is due to their substantial in-house tech department. Many others outsource development of new features to contractors. Medium wants to be everyone’s tech department (and, eventually, their ad department as well). In return for bearing the brunt of that work, Medium gets a bunch of publications to publish good stuff on their platform.
And for a small website in particular, the pitch is good: Medium takes the hassle out of the technical aspects of running a website — things like developing content management systems (there is no such thing as a good CMS); optimizing for mobile (faster load speeds, responsive design); and importing content into other optimization platforms (Facebook Instant Articles, Google AMP) — and provides revenue options, including sponsored posts and subscriptions. As its copy says, “Say goodbye to paying for hosting, scrutinizing plugins, or hiring tech and design consultants.”
But it’s also hard not to wonder what it means that so many prominent small blogs are leaving self-maintained backends for a new life on a larger, VC-funded platform at once. For one, there’s the ever-present concern about hosting your content on another company’s website: What happens if it runs afoul of your partner’s standards, however they may be defined? And, maybe more sentimentally, what’s happening to the idea of small-scale, sustainable, independent web publishing?
The dream of the internet, with its low overhead and near-infinite user base, is that a smart publication can find a large audience whose attention and traffic can sustain it. But it’s increasingly clear that the demands of the web economy are squeezing out the already-small middle class of independent content creators — even those with audiences in the hundreds of thousands. If Medium can help small and self-sustaining publishers like the Awl and Pacific Standard be better, for longer, that’s something to celebrate. But it also feels like the latest in a series of increasingly clear signals that the display-ad model, relying as it does on irritating and cheap programmatic ad networks, and competition with much larger publications (not to mention social networks), is not a sustainable business model even for the smart and popular.
Nintendo took a bold new step with its Pokémon franchise this week when it revealed a new trailer for Great Detective Pikachu, a game for the 3DS, the premise of which should be fairly obvious.
Not surprisingly, sectors of the internet are very excited for the game, which features new innovations like … uh, Pikachu speaks real words and wears a deerstalker cap. It’s tough to overstate how important the hat is. One of the most important hats of 2016, for sure.
Let’s compare and contrast. Classic Pikachu does not wear a cute detective hat and speaks in high-pitched gibberish. Great Detective Pikachu, however, has a robust vocabulary and the alarming voice of a mid-level salaryman.
It hasn’t even been confirmed that the game is making its way to North America but fans are already making plans. A Change.org petition requesting for Danny DeVito to voice English-language Pikachu is nearing 25,000 signatures. This makes a lot of sense, considering Pikachu and Mr. DeVito are short, rotund creatures who can control and channel electricity.
In response to the petition, some fans have brought up DeVito’s role on the decidedly not-kid-friendly series It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
Great Detective Pikachu launches in Japan, sans magnum dongs, early next month.
Players are still debating which choice was “right.” Saving the whole town yields a longer, more developed ending, but why abandon true love? Others whine that Warren, the wan male love interest who has a crush on Max, gets short shrift on attention from the girls, perhaps just like the players themselves did. Talk about sympathetic storytelling. I first chose to save Arcadia Bay, but of course, once I knew the ending, I went back and played through the other option.
It’s this flexibility that makes Life Is Strange something special and new, like a TV show that we actively participate in, not just comment on on Twitter. Unlike the case of Final Fantasy VII (Aeris is never coming back from the dead, sorry), the game widens the possibilities of its story rather than limiting them, letting players complete the experience on their own. Is there any other way to tell a story in the era of social media?
When I was a kid, the single epic romance in video games was the never-consumated love between hero Cloud Strife and flower seller Aerith Gainsborough in Final Fantasy VII. It was emotionally powerful (if you were a middle-schooler), but when Aerith died at the hands of Sephiroth, the game’s nemesis, that was it. Not a lot of room for maneuvering in the inevitable fan fiction. These days, the best romance in video games is Chloe and Max, the stars of Life Is Strange. Theirs is no less emotional a relationship, but it is a lot more realistic. And it’s also more ambiguous, both as a relationship and as a narrative — meaning it’s built for the Tumblr era of fandom, in which a game’s ability to be the foundation of emotional investment and fan fiction is as important as its gameplay. The best part? Life is Strange’s gameplay doesn’t suffer at all.
The plot is fairly simply: The protagonist, hipster photographer Maxine Caulfield, or Max, has to find out what’s going on with sudden disappearances and suicide threats at her Pacific Northwest boarding school in a town called Arcadia Bay, and in the process falls into an ambiguous semi-romance with her best friend, the blue-haired punk Chloe Price.
As should be expected in the age of Tumblr and Livejournal, the game’s fandom has run with the intentional ambiguity, naming the (relation)ship “Pricefield” and creating mash-note fan art of the pair. This kind of fandom creativity is already common, of course — see One Direction. But in Life Is Strange, online shipping and debate about which characters belong together is a priority for the game. It moves toward the precedence of shipping over the game’s actual story, and I’m not looking back.
The creators of Life Is Strange, Dontnod, have encouraged fandom rather than limiting it, or relegating the community to an afterthought. Part of that choice reveals itself in the structure of the game. It just so happens that Max can travel back in time by looking at the photographs she takes, allowing players to explore different narrative paths and correct actions that they don’t want to figure in their final game. The writing of Max’s internal monologue also makes room for ambiguity. That her character is sympathetic but not particularly deep turns her into a blank slate for players of any age, though I suspect teenagers aged similarly to the characters will find it the most potent (it’s a video-game YA novel).
As ridiculous as Life Is Strange can sound, it’s a masterpiece of ambient storytelling. There’s one moment when, after Max and Chloe break into the school late at night and end up swimming in the pool (in my play-through, at least), the two wake up at Chloe’s house in the morning and a period-perfect Bright Eyes song starts playing. At this point, the player doesn’t have to do anything — the camera angle cuts around like a Sofia Coppola movie and the song continues to its end, a perfect slice of life and an idealized version of a high-school memory.
Moments like these make the Chloe-Max ship catnip for Tumblr. Games’ stories are ever more open for players to bring to them what they will, no matter the creators’ intentions. Life Is Strange is smart in anticipating that desire and, like a great novel, making room for it.
Life Is Strange comes to a head as players realize that Max’s time-traveling is actually exacerbating the problems around her rather than solving them. (In case you’re planning on playing, you should be aware that spoilers follow.) During the climax, Max must make a choice: Save Chloe, or let the semi-symbolic hurricane destroy all of Arcadia Bay and everyone in it. This choice has been rendered in the fandom as “Bae or Bay?” Choose bae, Chloe and Max escape. Decide to save humanity, and Max and Chloe kiss as the hurricane swirls, before Max turns back the clock and allows Chloe to die instead. It’s not quite straight-up romance, but it’s slightly more than high-school BFF, hence the fandom’s fervor.
While the game itself stays admirably far away from “fan service,” players have done with the characters what they will, which as usual includes explicit fan fiction, among more mundane examples. Searching “Chloe x Max” on Tumblr reveals a world of shippers who cosplay as Chloe, sketch the two making out, and capture GIFs from the game itself.
Now, you can take great selfies in public without anybody knowing. Great job, Mansooon!
Selfie sticks are very popular tools but I doubt any would argue that they are quote-unquote cool. They’re super dorky. However, they’re also very popular because we have not yet figured out how to work our arms like Stretch Armstrong. One day, science will have the answer. Until then, we have the ‘selfie arm.’
If you’ve ever been embarrassed about using a selfie stick, Japanese comedy site Omocoro, via Kotaku, posted the schematics for the odd device which allows people to use a selfie stick without drawing attention.
Here’s a closer look at what it’s like to use the inconspicuous device.
Smartphone photography expert Mansooon came up with the clandestine device by combining fake hands…
… with a homemade very-long-sleeved shirt.
After all of this commentary, and a letter of concern from Maryland representative Katherine Clark, Hey, Inc. decided to shut Stolen down “until further notice.”
But here’s the strangest thing about this whole saga: Stolen looks to adults like a gross, unfun app with meaningful privacy and consent issues, but the kids were eating it up and didn’t understand why it had to close. The Verge reported Stolen had 40,000 active players, and several of them reacted to the shutdown announcement with disappointment, confusion, and “bruh!”
This seems absolutely crazy to me — and so does spending real money on more points to “steal” people with — but it was a viable business model, supported by a generation unencumbered by our apparently naïve grown-up ideas about privacy and personal autonomy online.
It’s comforting to see this unsettling vision of the future rejected — for now. But it’s going to keep knocking, and one day we might let it in.
Earlier this week, someone sent Holly Brockwell, editor of tech news site Gadgette, a disturbing screenshot: “Boom!” it said, “Holly Brockwell belongs to you now.” She’d been “owned” in a game called Stolen. But what the hell is Stolen? Brockwell understandably wanted to know.
As it turned out, Stolen is — now was; it was closed Thursday — a gamelike app that let players spend points to “steal” others’ Twitter profiles, basically buying and selling them like baseball cards. You could pay real money for more points to “steal” the accounts of friends and celebrities from their current “owners,” but no one was allowed to own their own profile. Stolen launched earlier this month to hyperbolic praise from the business press — “Stolen is the Insanely Addictive Viral Game That People Are Begging to Play,” raved Fortune — and shut down this week in the face of harassment and privacy concerns raised by Brockwell and others.
A number of commentators (and one U.S. congresswoman) pointed out some legitimate problems with the game — problems that should have been obvious from the get-go — but the kids who were actively playing Stolen are still pissed to see it go away.
In the post-Gamergate era, where Twitter is a minefield of harassment for women, the issues with an app that lets you “own” someone and write whatever you want on their virtual trading card, without giving any Twitter user a way to opt in or out, should be obvious. But it appears the company behind Stolen, Hey Inc., hadn’t considered any of them until a handful of female journalists published editorials on the subject.
Brockwell, writing for Gadgette, was one of the first to raise the alarm, writing Wednesday that “it’s tremendously unnerving to have someone tell you out of nowhere that they ‘own’ you now. That your name and likeness is being traded on an app you had no knowledge of and hadn’t given permission to. The whole concept of people being able to own, buy and sell other people without their consent is absolutely abhorrent to us, and raises a slew of problems that it’s clear the team at Stolen haven’t anticipated.”
The CEO of Hey, Inc., Siqi Chen, apologized to Brockwell and said he’d add an opt-out option to Stolen. But, as games journalist Leigh Alexander pointed out in The Guardian, it still required Twitter users who didn’t want to be “owned” to send a direct message to Stolen. And anyway, the fact that Chen never considered the need for an opt-out in the first place shows how crazy, broken, and completely divorced from the realities of online harassment the Stolen concept really was.
The Next Web’s Lauren Hockenson pointed out another problem with Stolen: Not only is it jarring to suddenly find yourself “for sale,” but Stolen’s core concept just doesn’t seem enjoyable at all.
“So, that’s it. You buy people, and then other people pay more than you to take that person away. This drives up the value of certain usernames — say, more than 54 million for @justinbieber. And that, the app tells me, is what is supposed to be fun,” she wrote.
Writer and editor Zak Stone’s father died while staying at an Airbnb when a branch holding a rope swing snapped. What did Airbnb do about it? Not much, Stone explains in a harrowing Matter feature — the company disclaims all liability for accidents that might happen when guests stays at rooms hosted through its platform. If you were waiting for something terrible to happen in the legally dubious world of Airbnb rentals, Stone writes, “My family’s story — a private matter until now — is that terrible something.”
Stone’s long article examines what happens after that “terrible something” occurs. Though he and his family are lucky enough to secure a settlement from the homeowner’s insurance of the Airbnb hosts, most insurance policies don’t cover commercial activity. He tracks down the story of a woman who apparently died of carbon monoxide poisoning while staying at an unregulated Airbnb in Taiwan, learning that her family apparently accepted a $2 million settlement from the company “for humanitarian reasons” only — Airbnb insisted it was not liable.
Airbnb isn’t the only “sharing economy” start-up to be facing a backlash as it becomes clear that the “platforms” that allow people to put unused assets like cars and apartments on a digital market can’t and won’t accept responsibility for customers’ safety. The website Who’s Driving You? keeps an extensive list of alleged assault, rape, and robbery incidents reported by Uber users.
The problem for the start-ups, and their investors, is that ensuring that customers are safe and liabilities are clear is expensive. At the competitive rates they have established, these companies simply can’t afford to ensure users’ basic security. “Were Airbnb to invest in safety requirements by offering home inspections or by analyzing photo content to target higher-risk properties … such a program could be far more costly, and might jeopardize Airbnb’s covetable neutrality as a platform,” Stone writes. “Amateur innkeepers who couldn’t be trusted with the banal task of photographing and marketing their properties are expected to excel at hospitality’s most important rule: keeping guests safe and alive.”
What’s more, Uber and Airbnb are fighting for even less regulation in the way they deal with their users and workers. Uber wants to keep its drivers as contract workers rather than employees, further distancing them from being implicated in the drivers’ actions. (New drivers undergo background checks, but their practices are shoddy, failing to detect 25 drivers with criminal backgrounds.) Airbnb recently defeated Proposition F, a San Francisco law that would have limited its rentals while also ensuring they are up to city code.
Hotels might be stodgier, less convenient, and more expensive than crashing in someone’s spare room, but they’re also certified by inspectors and legally culpable when things go wrong. Stability can be a good thing.
The real proof of a podcast-messaging link is Rolltape, a new app that combines audio messaging with some of the trappings of “This American Life” — namely, the soft intro music that floats listeners into a reverie. Rolltape was created by a former Google employee named Jessica Taylor, who was driving to work one day and pondering how she would respond to a long email from a close friend who had just recently moved away. Getting the time to write an email seemed insurmountable, and a phone call would also have been hard to schedule. “You just get the feeling that no one’s ever reaching each other,” Taylor says.
Instead, Taylor thought about what she might do while in the car, “feeling reflective, I have some time where I’m not working or with family,” she says. Inspiration struck when she realized she could record something like her side of a phone call, and have the conversation asynchronously. The app, which limits audio messages to 5 minutes and adds the option of intro and outro music, creates a unique space for communication, different than social media or even text messaging, Taylor argues. “This could be a place where they could be real with their most trusted people. It’s not the stuff you feel at liberty to post on Facebook. What’s going on with your boss this week, what weird thing did she say to you?”
Taylor likens it to Instagram, but instead of filters there’s a frame for your speech, adding on some of the august gravity of Ira Glass. “Now anyone can create something beautiful with their voice,” she says.
Wiseman agrees that we’re getting used to listening a little harder, again. “I imagine we’re all a little more conscious of curated audio. It’s in the cultural consciousness at the moment, especially now that NPR voice has gotten so viral,” she says. “Somebody’s Voxer conversations could make a great podcast.”
Yet the popularity of audio messaging also brings back that early paradox of the return to conversation. In exchanging voice memos like we do text messages, “we’re coming in full circle, getting closer to just talking,” Wiseman adds. So maybe we should just get back on the phone?
When Emma Wiseman, a puppeteer living in Brooklyn, recently embarked on a new relationship, she was facing a now-common concern: What if her boyfriend was bad at texting? “You spend a lot of time in relationships now overanalyzing text messages,” she says. Thankfully, that didn’t turn out to be a problem, because he only communicates in audio messages through an app called Voxer. With audio messaging, or “voice-texting,” “you just get a sense of what’s going on. You can dispense with all of the weird added-on drama,” Wiseman says.
While it might not solve all your dating problems, audio messaging is a nice solution to the ambiguity of texts. The ability to send short voice memos rather than text was added natively to iPhones in iOS8, but third-party apps have been working on the problem of text misinterpretation for a while. WeChat’s over 500 million monthly users, many Chinese, prefer audio messages. WhatsApp includes audio as well. Voxer launched as an app in 2011, inspired by founder Tom Katis’s experiences on the battlefield in Afghanistan. In 2015, the app hit over 60 million users. It’s even on the Apple Watch.
I thought everyone hated talking on the phone. Why are we going back to using our voices? In the short time since we’ve abandoned actual phone conversations for text-based communication, whether it’s SMS or Facebook Messenger, we’ve developed a library of ways to add tone and inflection — from emoticon to emoji to stamps to GIFs. But it still seems like there’s nothing quite like actual speech. And voice messaging gives you that, with all the added benefits of asynchronous text exchanges. With Voxer, “there are no blinking gray dots,” Wiseman says, those symbols of text indecision. “I think there is an intimacy to it that reading words on a page doesn’t have, which is really nice.”
Audio messaging can be functional: “It’s faster than typing, and there’s no risk of your tone coming off the wrong way,” says Jillian Primiano, a nursing student at New York University who uses the iPhone’s audio messaging capabilities. “You also don’t have a full phone call’s span to find a different way to make an idiot of yourself.” Wiseman’s boyfriend started using the Voxer app to communicating while on his bike, keeping his hands (relatively) free.
Aside from convenience, though, the alternative communication method is amusing, a way to refresh our relationship with technology that can seem so mundane. “I started using voice-to-text because I saw a friend do it and thought it was funny,” Primiano says. “One time I was texting with a friend and I voice-messaged ‘Was he good-looking?’ knowing the people around me would hear me, as sort of like a public joke. A few people laughed, so I guess it worked.”
Podcasts are so popular — “Serial” just returned, marking the first birthday of their renaissance — that I started wondering if the audio boom had simply spilled over into text-messaging. We love podcasts so much that we want our lives to turn into them, recasting mundane daily experience into touching audio narrations. I asked Nick Quah, creator of Hot Pod, a popular podcast newsletter, if there might be a connection.
Quah wasn’t sure if audio messaging had attained the same scale as podcasting, yet. But he could see why there might be demand for these apps. “I do believe there’s a lot more hunger now that’s triggered peripherally by the recent enhanced attention on podcasting,” he says. “It’s brought to mind that audio is a uniquely mobile-oriented form.” The more we’re accustomed to Sarah Koenig speaking into our ear, perhaps the more we’ll want our friends to do the same.
Aydin Büyüktas, an Istanbul-based photographer and VFX artist, used a drone to capture aerial images of the city, then digitally manipulated them so they appear wildly curved. The middle of each image is a straight overhead view, but the perspective shifts toward head-on as your eyes move toward the bottom of the frame, creating the illusion that the viewer is about to fall into the photo.
A 3-D animator by trade, Büyüktas writes that Flatland aimed to bring “another dimension” to photos of places that were familiar to him. His twisted, sloping series of images is called “Flatland,” after the 19th-century satire of the same name, but everyone seems to think it was inspired by Inception.
It might not be a coincidence that “Flatland” has blown up online this week: It makes a perfect visual response to rapper B.o.B’s wacko flat-Earth ramblings, which everyone on the internet (especially Neil DeGrasse Tyson) spent Tuesday taking too seriously.
The appeal of wireless power, to me at least, is that it affords a kind of mobility. I have this mental image of hanging around my apartment, my phone magically vacuuming up power no matter where I am. But that’s not the case as of now. Cord or no cord, you’ll still be tethered to a fixed point.
Work is slow and steady. Sure, Apple may develope some unforeseen breakthrough that blows the last decade of wireless power out of the water, but I doubt it. And if you think it’s coming next year, temper your expectations now.
There are some indications of what Apple might be working on. In 2010, they patented a method for charging a device up to one meter away from the power source. A whole three feet! I don’t mean to sound totally sarcastic; that’s very cool. At the same time, six-foot charging cables are pretty cheap on Monoprice.
Today, Bloomberg News is reporting an incredible scoop: Apple is working on phones that charge wirelessly, and we could be seeing them as soon as next year! Wowee zowee, that’s amazing!
Or at least, it would be if we hadn’t been hearing about this mythical “electricity over the air” for the last decade or so. The type of power transfer that Bloomberg is reporting is significantly different from the type of cordless charging on the market today, which still requires specific pieces of hardware — charging mats — to power up devices. What Apple is reportedly working on is a method “that would allow iPhones and iPads to be powered from farther away than the charging mats used with current smartphones.”
The transfer of electricity over the air is possible. In 2007, a team of MIT researchers “were able to transfer 60 watts with ∼40% efficiency over distances in excess of 2 meters.” But the consumer technology industry, which moves at a breakneck pace compared to other sectors, still hasn’t introduced any such method for mobile devices.
In 2009, Fast Company proclaimed “Wireless Electricity Is Here (Seriously),” running down the various methods. One of them was a device that “looks like a mouse pad and can send power through the air, over a distance of up to a few inches.”
Another company, WiTricity, comes up frequently in write-ups of wireless power — it was founded by some of the same researchers who conducted the 2007 MIT study. The company’s main thrust appears to be using magnetic fields as the method of transferring electricity. To be clear, they do have consumer hardware for wireless charging, but it’s not the sci-fi dream that reports might have you believe.
This is their method for charging an iPhone wirelessly as of two years ago.
This is impressive! You can turn any flat surface into a charging station. But it’s also important to look at what the system doesn’t tolerate — moving the device more than a few inches from the hotspot. This is the type of freedom that wireless charging currently offers.
Daniel Lara and Josh Holz, the two teenagers responsible for “Damn, Daniel!,” were on Ellen Tuesday, because that is how memes work in 2016. Ellen gave Holz a surfboard and got Vans to give him a lifetime supply of shoes (how exactly is that quantified, by the way?). Notably, she didn’t publicly give Lara $10,000, as a rumor floating around the internet alleged (Telepictures, the show’s production company, didn’t return a request for comment about the rumor). That being said, Kayla Newman hasn’t received a lifetime supply of anything, and “On Fleek” is a golden meme. “Damn, Daniel!” will fade into the horizon within a couple of months, but “On Fleek” is forever.
On Tumblr, a user named Formeldeharv fed Mariah Carey’s holiday classic through a MIDI converter, turning it into a piano track, and then turned that back into an MP3. It is fascinating and sounds like a piano falling down an escalator for eternity. I love it, and I am afraid of it.
Precisely why you can almost hear the elusive chanteuse’s vocals on the track is unclear. If you want to get technical, Robinson Meyer at The Atlantic theorizes:
Sounds plausible. I believe it.
Ozzy Osbourne’s “Bark at the Moon” is considered a pretty tough song to play perfectly in Guitar Hero. It’s not quite in the top ten, but it’s up there. That’s why one player was disappointed to find that YouTube’s automated copyright-protection system had taken down a video of him performing a coveted full combo on the song. Not to worry, though — he found a clever and hilarious way around the problem of copyrighted recordings: He just made all the guitar sounds with his mouth and reuploaded the video. Problem solved.
You’d think that after decades of failed anti-piracy campaigning, music and video-game companies would have realized that it makes zero sense to take down what amounts to a free, fanmade advertisement for their products. Instead, we have an impersonal system that indiscriminately erases fun and interesting things from the web (along with all the pirated music).
But sometimes restrictions breed creativity, and the workarounds humans use to escape the wrath of the machines end up being more interesting than the original videos.
A group of buddies on a weekend getaway in France got more than they asked for when they discovered a woman’s decomposing body in a garden on the property.
Police told AFP that the body was found “hunched in a dug-out area, her head against the ground, covered in branches and surrounded by wood stumps.” Police suspect foul play, though no identifying materials were found with the deceased. The renters were questioned over the weekend.
Airbnb’s website does not currently have any policy regarding corpses found on properties being rented out. An Airbnb spokesperson said, “We have offered our assistance to the police and will help them with their investigation in any way we can. In addition, we reached out to the host and guests and will provide all necessary support. Over 80 million people have travelled on Airbnb and problems for hosts and guests are extremely rare.”
(Creepier than Genius’s conceptual model — third-party annotations are, after all, as old as writing itself, and a long sought-after feature of the open web — is the idea that, as developer Vijith Assar puts it, “the content and mechanisms [of online annotations] could end up owned by a single for-profit tech startup.” Assar suggests an “open-source software project,” or something “handled by a standards body.”)
Still: Dawson’s follow-up blog post raised the specter of online harassment on the Genius platform. (Let’s pause to note, again, that no one has accused Morrison or Finnegan of harassment, merely of “empty criticism” and insensitivity, and the concern over abuse has stayed entirely in the hypothetical mode.) On Monday, U.S. representative Katherine Clark (D-MA) wrote a letter to Genius’s CEO, Tom Lehman, expressing concern over the service following the Slate article on the controversy. “Developers have a responsibility to consider how their platforms can be used to perpetrate abuse,” she wrote. (Clark wrote a similarly concerned letter about the now-defunct app Stolen, which let people “own” real social-media accounts.)
Clark’s letter, maybe unsurprisingly, seems to misunderstand the story (Genius hasn’t yet enabled abuse or harassment) and how Genius works — it doesn’t “inject […] comments directly into protected content.” Though, as noted above, the interface is easy to misinterpret if you’re not versed in its technical implementation.
Still, Clark’s letter got a sincere response. Genius quickly responded with a statement saying that every single annotation published by users is read by a mix of staff and volunteer moderators on the service, and that they have no tolerance for abusive behavior on the service. The company also today introduced an omnipresent Report Abuse button that sits underneath every annotation.
“I’m glad Genius responded to public pressure and built a reporting feature for abusive annotations,” Ella Dawson said in an email. “But I also find it hard to believe that they take the potential for harassment and abuse on their platform as seriously as they say they do when they launched their product without a tool to report abuse at all, and only added one after a congresswoman wrote a letter.” (The feature’s introduction shortly after Clark’s letter is likely a coincidence; feature rollouts rarely happen in a matter of hours.)
Dawson added that one feature was still missing: “There is still no way for me to disable annotations on my own website, which is all I asked for. There are people actively writing code to break Genius’s product on their sites, and that should be a huge sign to Genius that their product is invasive and unwanted.”
The question at this point becomes one of scale: The News Genius annotator and its community, in its nascent state, is small enough that it can monitor all of its content easily. But as the service grows — it does, after all, want to be the de facto discussion forum for every page on the world wide web — it’s not clear how to scale up safety measures. Moreover, as Genius becomes more widely adopted, its separation from the articles it’s annotating will become less clear: If “everyone” uses Genius (as “everyone” uses Twitter), avoiding its annotations would become more difficult, and the threshold for seeing potentially abusive comments would be much lower.
Till then, it’s just another thing on the internet that you never need to look at.
This week, the website Genius caught flack for … something. Commentary? Abuse? Something in-between? Depends on whom you ask. Genius — which got its start as Rap Genius, a tool for annotating lyrics — recently unveiled a tool that lets users annotate, and view annotations on, any website. As you might imagine: Some people did not like that.
This particular minor controversy began last week, when blogger Ella Dawson wrote a post on her blog about using the word “suffering” in conjunction with herpes. A writer named Sara Morrison — apparently a social acquaintance of Dawson’s who’d been criticizing the post on Twitter — then used Genius’s tool to annotate it. Genius’s newly minted managing editor, Leah Finnegan, joined in with four annotations of her own.
The annotations are still visible, if you want to read them; it’s important to note that they’re critical, but not even Dawson has described them as “abusive.” Nevertheless, she wasn’t particularly pleased, and followed up the original post with another, called “How News Genius Silences Writers,” about how viewing her blog through the lens of the Genius tool felt “like discovering graffiti over some of my most personal work.” Genius, she argued, has the potential to “intimidate and silence marginalized voices … A tool that allows my abusive ex-boyfriend to interact with me and my content is a tool that should not exist.” (The ex-boyfriend’s annotations are hypothetical; Dawson is imagining a worst-case scenario for Genius’s use.) Genius users, of course, annotated this post as well; a few days later, Slate published a dramatically sub-headlined article (“A new tool wants to annotate everything on the Internet. But at what cost?”). And then, yesterday, a U.S. congresswoman got involved. More on that in a minute.
Two things might help contextualize this debate. The first is Genius’s particular place in the media-internet firmament: The company is attempting to transform itself from a slick lyrics site into a platform for annotating everything, news and essays included. Maybe more important, it’s also trying to shed an early, and deserved, reputation as “a company of brogrammers.” Finnegan, a former New York Times and Gawker editor known for her smart and caustic media criticism, was hired to help usher along this transformation; in the weeks that she’s been working at Genius, she’s mostly been annotating articles from the Times and other institutional media outlets. (A few days prior to the Dawson annotations, Finnegan had critically annotated an article on NYMag’s the Cut, causing another, smaller Twitter fuss.)
The second is the technical implementation of Genius’s annotations. Genius works when users insert its web address — genius.it — before any URL. This allows a person to highlight passages and attach notes to them. For instance, if you wanted to annotate this post, you could add “genius.it/” before the URL. So, and this is worth saying explicitly: Genius’s software does not change, update, or affect the website itself. The various files that make up the product you get when you visit that website at its given URL are left totally unaffected.
This is where the discussion of public space and control on the web gets a bit messy. Blog posts like Dawson’s are public, and are unquestionably subject to scrutiny and critique, as Dawson herself admits. At the same time, Dawson is under no obligation to provide a space for such a discussion to occur. Generally, these two concerns are easily reconcilable, as the post and response would be silo-ed off from one another: the blog post on WordPress, the ensuing discussion in a separate forum, like Twitter. (Comments sections are an exception, but, crucially, no one is obligated by law or custom to include a comments section on his or her site.)
Genius upholds the distinction between original post and reaction, most clearly on a technical level: Morrison’s annotations on Dawson’s post are hosted on Genius’s servers and Genius’s platform, not on Dawson’s. But Genius’s interface blurs that line by presenting itself as a discussion layered directly on top of the original creation, albeit one out of the creator’s control. Worse, it doesn’t provide an easy way for website owners to prevent Genius from operating on their pages. (It has offered certain “editorial tools” to publishers, including to Dawson, though the company hasn’t publicly said what those are or how much control they provide.) You can see why people might freak out, especially on a small personal blog: In a vague but understandable sense, Genius grafts a comments section onto a page that might not otherwise have one.
This might come across as a bit pushy, if not creepy, if you’ve never encountered it before. But there’s also really nothing wrong with it, except in the “this feels weird” sense: No one is under any obligation to use the Genius tool — and, in fact, until recently, not many people in this particular corner of the media internet have. Genius should make it easier for sites to opt out of its annotations, sure, but the entire experience is “opt-in” already: You have to install the Genius browser extension, or click on a different URL, to access annotations, effectively achieving the same kind of silo and control that has traditionally existed on personal sites.
The implicit message of Mega64’s video is a solid one, too: YouTubers still have the power of parody. The bigger, more profitable, and more recognizable something becomes, the stronger the legal grounds for mocking it. A sincere “React” competitor might not be able to stand up to the Fine Bros., but a parodic one can certainly try to thumb its nose at them.
If you want to make a YouTube video of someone reacting to something, you’ll have to go through the Fine Bros. Variety reports that Rafi and Benny Fine, who’ve built a YouTube empire on interviewing kids, teens, and old folks about various pop-cultural phenomena, have set up a new venture called React World. It aims to aggregate and monetize every “react” video on YouTube — as in, "Someone Reacts to Something" — with the Fines handling licensing and taking a cut of the profit. And other prominent YouTubers are pissed.
Here’s how React World will operate, according to Variety and the Fines’ enthusiastic announcement video: Any non-Fine-affiliated channel that wants to make “react”-style videos will be able to get a license from the Fines, which comes with a brand bible ensuring the videos meet the brothers’ specifications. The Fine Bros. will push all the videos through their React World channel, exposing them to a large, preexisting audience, and take a cut of the revenue in return.
This also applies to a bunch of other Fine Bros. video templates, including “Do They Know It,” “People Vs Food,” “Lyric Breakdown,” “Try Not to Smile or Laugh,” “Opinions,” and “People Vs Technology.” And the Fines have acquired the trademarks to go with them: Yes, they trademarked “React” and “Opinions” for the YouTube video market.
This did not sit well with the hosts of popular YouTube video-game comedy channel Mega64, who see the Fines consolidation of their brand as an insincere cash-grab that will stop other channels from using what seem like pretty broad and generic video formats. And on top of that, they fear the Fines will try to … er, fine, anyone whose videos come too close to the territory they’ve staked out.
Here’s their parody of the Fine Bros. announcement, in which they mockingly announce that they’ve copyrighted “Videos Filmed Outside” and “YouTube Videos™.”
They may not be clear on the difference between copyright and trademark, but maybe they have a point. Does anyone other than the Fine Bros. benefit from making sure videos of people reacting to things are aesthetically similar and consolidated under one brand?
It’s not as crazy (or stupid) as it sounds: Snapchat’s VP of content Nick Bell recently said that two-thirds of Snapchatters are over 18, Tech Insider reports. Combine that with Snapchat’s 100 million daily users, divide by the number of users currently living in New York, and then divide again by the number who are registered Democrats, and Sanders is definitely looking at, at least, a dozen eligible voters.
It’s 2016, and nothing says “get out the vote” like a Snapchat filter. Or that’s what Bernie Sanders is thinking. Or at least that’s what his social-media intern is thinking.
The Democratic presidential candidate has his own Snapchat geofilter today, in honor of New York’s Democratic primary. It reads “VOTE BERNIE TODAY” and features a tiny, animated Sanders grinning toothily and standing shoulder to shoulder with Lady Liberty. (“Geofilters” are overlays and filters you can place on Snapchats only in a specific geographical area.)
But not everybody is feeling the … you know.
Let’s be direct here. This isn’t a Snapchat issue. Anybody can purchase a sponsored filter. That means Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Ralph Nader, Dan Smith, Dr. Zizmor, and the guy who walks around with his cat on his head. Anybody. Bernie Sanders has a Snapchat filter because Bernie Sanders paid for a Snapchat filter. (Bernie, not the billionaires, as the filter makes very clear.) Hillary has only herself to blame.
One of the best ones that I discovered is Sycamore Star Wars Place, which contains broken links to desktop themes and screensavers, email lists (so far, none of my attempts to subscribe have gone through), and a list of mythological references in the films (“Yes, Star Wars is a great story, fun, exciting … but it’s also crammed full of all sorts of mythological motifs.”)
At least one index page for an email list called the Pod Race Reporter has survived, though the actual content of these emails has not been archived. Some things about the web haven’t changed that much, as indicated in a March 1999 email titled, “ FLASH! Star Wars trailer South-Parked!”
The website countingdown.com was established, according to a 2002 writeup in Slate, as a way to harness intense fandom. “Sponsoring lines in Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco, then, [the site’s creators] used the Countingdown.com Web site to promote the lines, leak Episode I-related information, and host live Web broadcasts from the Hollywood line.” In 1999, the three-week-long line-waiting effort brought in “30,000,000 streams of video to Web users, and raised a total of $75,000 for the Starlight Children’s Foundation.”
Archives of the site’s news section around the time of the launch of The Phantom Menace show frantic and obsessive updates that are now commonplace.
And who could forget Star Wars’ humble beginnings at the forefront of viral content, the Star Wars Rap. An at-the-time-impressive Flash animation that asked, “What if Darth Vader … rapped?” Over on Scott’s Star Wars Message Board, known as the Cantina, a 2001 thread entitled “Star Wars Gangsta Rap!!! LOL, you gotta see this!!” implores users to head over to atomfilms.com.
The official Star Wars website celebrated the rap’s accolades back in 2002. The post, for some reason, no longer exists on the franchise’s official site.
It’s entirely possible that today, on the eve of a new Star Wars film, you are tired of reading about Star Wars online. The new movie, The Force Awakens, dominates the Trending Topics and Recommended Videos that make up the 2015 web’s well-oiled content recirculation machine; any publication with access and information has a large and resource-rich internet presence. But this was not always the case.
In 1999, when The Phantom Menace premiered, only 36 percent of people used the internet. That number stands at 84 percent today. Gathering online to talk about Star Wars was still relatively novel back at the turn of the century, and was dominated by fan sites and message boards, not well-funded start-ups and well-known media organizations. Many of the sites that dominated the Star Wars anticipation machine have either gone dark or moved on. Still, plumbing the depths of the Internet Archive reveals tons of good stuff.
One of the earliest, still-running fan sites is theforce.net, which was initially called the Star Wars Page at Texas A & M. Old versions of it online are mostly broken now, but the earliest version points out that the site is “best viewed at a desktop area of 800x600 pixels.”
On November 15, 1997, site admin Chris Kivlehan posted an editorial (this was before blogging software) called “Six Episodes or Nine Episodes?”
There were also, ahead of user-generated content sites like Wikipedia and Archive of Our Own, pages dedicated to an encyclopedic breakdown of vehicles and technical aspects of the series, as well as a robust fan-fiction section.
When Geocities went the way of the dodo, many early fan sites vanished along with it, though early snapshots still exist on outmoded services like Webring, which let people establish ad hoc website networks.
One of the most popular subreddits on the hobo in a three-piece suit that is Reddit.com is called r/showerthoughts. It is a repository for “shower thoughts,” those profoundly stupid, or stupidly profound, realizations that strike you when you least expect it, like in the shower. If you need a better analogy and are of a certain age, think Jack Handey’s Deep Thoughts.
Here’s the shower thought currently sitting on the section’s front page right now: “In reality, having a big heart is a medical condition that can kill you.” Nearly six million Redditors subscribe for these pearls of wisdom.
“Shower Thoughts” is also the Axe deodorant brand’s newest campaign. And Axe decided that it would be funny if former NBA player Muggsy Bogues said, “When you’re criticized for being short, they’re really just saying the worst thing about you is that there isn’t more of you.” (Bogues is famously short, you see.)
The problem, the Washington Post reports, is that the phrase also appeared on the subreddit last August, and appears to have been taken by Axe without credit. Now, Reddit — as much as a millions-strong user base can be generalized — is mad about that. A thread on the subject is up to nearly 2,500 comments.
As the Post points out, people online pass around shower thoughts unattributed all the time (there’s even a thread devoted to hunting them down). There’s a decent possibility that whoever wrote the ad thought it was just a general truism. Or an “African proverb.” What seems to have rubbed Redditors the wrong way this time is that their shower thought was used for … profit.
Which, well, c’mon, you guys. Yes, major corporations, and the ad firms that they hire, should probably get in the habit of attributing work they’ve lifted from the great sea of internet memes. That’d be nice for lots of people — such as, for example, Kayla Newman, the 16-year-old who came up with “on fleek.” The problem is that, in the grand scheme of things, “Reddit” is more “profitable company making money off of poorly sourced content with no creator compensation” than “creative community going uncompensated.” Maybe everyone should be better about sourcing.
The problem with digital assistants, Microsoft Word’s Clippy included, is that they can’t really do that much. Sure, they can offer you tips on copying-and-pasting and saving your work often. But they remain on the screen. MIT Media Lab’s new LineFORM robot makes that all better. The linear device can be a phone, a touch pad, and even a stencil. Your desk won’t need anything else.
The GIFs that the new media technology Tumblr Prosthetic Knowledge gathers are cartoonishly anthropomorphized. The snake robot flips into a phone handset; loops around your wrist and taps you when it has a message like an animalistic Apple Watch; and it wiggles when plugged into a laptop with data flowing through it! There’s a theoretical explanation about “the dynamism of animated curves,” but it mostly looks like the Pixar lamp came to life.
It’s a physical companion to the very virtual space of our computers. I bet it can even curl into the shape of a paper clip, if you really want.
Tuesday
Limit yourself to one hour total social media use, across desktop and mobile. Are you sure you want to waste ten minutes of your social-media time scrolling through vacation photographs of the weird guy from your freshman dorm who was into juggling? Do you really need to take 20 minutes picking a fight on Twitter? Now that we’ve made access more difficult, let’s also make it more intentional. Even if you just want to go on Facebook to kill time, you should make sure you’re killing time the way you want.
Wednesday
Unfollow all non-humans. On Facebook, Twitter*, and Instagram, reduce yourself to three, and only three, non-human pages to follow, each: Good, smart, well-run feeds. (Like, say, New York’s.) You’ll see the good stuff from other pages thanks to your friends, and you’ll eliminate the depressing anxiety that emanates from the particularly thirsty, and very rarely useful, brand accounts online. In particular, use Facebook’s feed settings (from the arrow in the upper right of a post) to hide posts with links specific pages or news outlets: If you have a friend who you generally like but can’t seem to stop sharing bad “Occupy Democrats” memes, you can lose those without losing your friend.
*We’ll make an exception for Twitter bots.
Thursday
Prune your feeds. Once you’ve eliminated the non-humans, it’s time to eliminate the humans. There are many schools of thought, here. Some people on Twitter unfollow everyone at once. That seems like overkill, but it’s the right attitude: Be brutal. My suggestion is to use your allotted social-media hour to scroll down your feed and Marie Kondo your shit. If a person doesn’t give you joy, unfollow them. If you’re worried about them noticing on Twitter, mute them instead. Remind yourself constantly that it is okay if you don’t see every tweet or update from every person. Facebook’s News Feed likes to serve up posts from people whose profiles we look at or whose updates we spend time on. But this doesn’t account for the fact that we tend to look at the profiles of trainwrecks we barely remember — people we don’t necessarily want to see in our feed. Unfollow them, now. You will not miss them.
Friday
Change your profile picture. You’ve been using that one for too long.
Saturday
There’s no better time than the new year to take on a long-planned, never-realized personal improvement project. Flush and gouty from the holidays, you watch the old, bad year recede in your rearview mirror like particularly gruesome roadkill, and think: This year, I’m going to fix it. Maybe you’re doing a “Drynuary,” or going on a diet, or cutting toxic relationships out of your life. Personally, I’m going to get ripped, read Moby-Dick, be nicer to my parents, write a novel, and win a Pulitzer. Maybe all at once!
Delete your tweets (optional). There are a couple schools of thought on this: Some people don’t understand why you’d publish something you’d later delete, and some people have only ever published things they wish they could later delete. Twitter — punchy, ephemeral, public — is better for the latter category of person if they know that their tossed-off jokes and thoughts won’t (necessarily) form one part of a public record against them; it makes the service feel more fun and chatty and less desperately self-promotional. I like the somewhat sketchy-looking “Tweetdelete,” which automatically deletes my Tweets every two weeks. Others prefer to do it all in one go. Either way, you get to start your year off really fresh.
But first, I’m going to fix my social media diet.
For people who spend their lives on the internet, as professionals or as interested amateurs, 2015 seemed like a particularly bad year for social media. (Smash cut to: Me saying the same thing about social media in 2014, 2013, and 2012.) “The Internet now seems to be on constant boil,” the Times’ Farhad Manjoo wrote in December. “Your social feed has always been loud, shrill, reflexive and ugly, but this year everything has been turned up to 11.”
If you feel this way, there are a bunch of strategies for fixing it: You could throw your phone in the trash, or you could throw your phone in the street, or you could even throw your phone in a lake. And I fully support you if that’s what’s healthiest for you.
Or maybe you don’t feel this way at all: Your social feeds are sources of vital information, sophisticated humor, and intellectual debate; you have a degree of self-control that allows you to dip in and out at will. In which case, well, you’re a liar, but you sound like a happy liar, so I won’t bug you.
But maybe using Twitter used to be fun and interesting, and now is like being a mind-reader at a Klan meeting. Or maybe Facebook used to be engaging and useful, and now it feels like a Xeroxed newsletter some guy handed you outside a health-food store. In that case, you don’t need to go off the grid. You just need to cleanse. Here’s a five-point plan.
Monday
Delete social-media apps from your phone and desktop. Delete any bookmarks you have. Close any pinned tabs. Want to check Twitter on your phone? Fine. You’ll need to open your phone’s browser. Want to look at Facebook photos? You’ll have to type the URL into your address bar. Day one is about making access marginally more difficult. Eventually, you’ll download the apps back onto your phone. Till then, you’ll be giving yourself an opportunity to use that nervous energy and twitchy thumb for something else.
New York City might get some snow today. You know who doesn’t care? Norwegians.
One such Norwegian is Trym Nordgaard, who is just out in the snow enjoying his “rolig mogenkauff” (translation: quiet morning coffee). Here he is, traveling down the street with his cup of joe.
Have a good day, Trym!
Better get to work, Kim! Those online reviews can make or break hardworking upstart local businesses like yours.
In the hours since North Korea announced it had detonated a hydrogen bomb at its nuclear test site, the small nation has become the subject of fierce condemnation from the U.S., the U.N., Russia, and China. But one world power has been more measured in its cricisim: Google Maps reviewers.
At least two years ago, some wise guy added a North Korean nuclear test facility to Google Maps. The facility currently has 74 reviews, averaging 3.2 stars out of 5. The middling three-star review, however, is actually the least represented. Five-star reviews are the most represented, followed by two-star reviews.
As one user writes:
Another one was more … radiant about the facility:
This guy had the opposite experience, though:
Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: A free service provided online — which integrated with one of your social-media profiles — was in actuality an attempt to gather your information in order to promote another service.
That’s what appears to be the case regarding #2015bestnine, a website that experienced a brief time in the spotlight late last year, when thousands of people used the service to compile their nine most-liked Instagram photos from 2015. The site culled publicly accessible profiles to create a grid of users’ most popular posts.
According to BuzzFeed, the site also prompted some visitors to provide their email address in order to pre-register for a soon-to-launch match-making site. Reportedly, 130,000 people signed up. Nine, which launched today, uses that photo collage as your dating profile. Its co-founders, Yusuke Matsumura and Mai Sekiguchi, claim that more than three-quarters of these early sign-ups were women. (Anecdotally, none of the people I spoke to who used the service recalled being prompted for or handing over their email address.)
What’s worth emphasizing is that, given how 2015bestnine.com worked, none of the tactics here are particularly invasive. The collage-making feature only required one data point: a public Instagram username. Users could not connect their accounts through the service’s API, which means that the site wouldn’t be able to access any private information associated with them. The only way that Nine could get email addresses … was by asking people to voluntarily provide their email addresses.
Still, this could have turned out way worse if a company with less scruples demanded tons of user information for the same service. In general, if a site is offering to scrape, analyze and aggregate your social-media posts, there’s something in it for them as well.
A lot of people, on the other hand, saw the photo for what it really was: a horrifying vision of the future in which virtual reality has supplanted meatspace human interaction as our main activity, each of us cordoned off in our own virtual bubble, ready to submit to the almighty, corpocratic algorithm that dictates the schedules of our every waking moment, as a grinning billionaire in dad jeans and New Balances strides past.
Fun!
At an event touting the Samsung Gear virtual-reality headset yesterday, Mark Zuckerberg strode to the stage, right past unaware users each lost in their own VR experience.
As is the case with most Zuckerberg images, it became fodder for some jokes.
Upon realizing the mistake, Mashable updated the post to remove all the Leon content and added this note at the top: “Mashable has learned that the screen shot from Twitter user @leyawn was fabricated. As a result, we’ve decided to remove all references to his details about the Twitter timeline test as there is now no way to verify their accuracy. Mashable apologizes for this error.”
If it’s any comfort to Mashable, though, everyone makes mistakes. The New York Times once quoted a prank interview with someone who uses the Twitter handle @weedhitler.
Everyone is so mad about the possibility that Twitter might show tweets in nonchronological order that people are willing to believe anything about what the new timeline might look like — even if it’s a fake screenshot from a Weird Twitter jokester. Consistently delightful internet poster Leon Chang (@leyawn) got Mashable to publish an article Tuesday based on some Photoshopped jokes he made.
The Mashable post, by former editor-in-chief Lance Ulanoff, cited this screenshot Leyawn mocked up last week.
Note that the “top tweets” include a joke from Weird Twitter personality @Dril and a tweet that just says “fuck ass crapper.” (This is a small meme that was going around at the time.)
And this tweet, also cited in the Mashable article, is a joke about how an algorithmic timeline might promote the already-powerful at the expense of people with fewer followers:
Ulanoff interviewed Chang as if his screenshot were real, and Chang just rolled with it, telling Ulanoff that he must have been picked to test the new timeline because he’s “some kind of power user.”
And he provided a new fake screenshot. It looks like this:
Seemingly contrary to federal assurances that the FBI’s request that Apple help it break into Syed Farook’s iPhone would be a one-and-done deal, the Department of Justice is currently pursuing court orders to compel Apple to help law enforcement break into locked phones in about a dozen different cases around the U.S., The Wall Street Journal reports.
Prosecutors in all of the cases the DOJ is requesting Apple assist authorities with used the same broad 18th-century law, the All Writs Act, that the government uses when it “seeks to fill in a statutory gap that Congress has failed to consider,” a Brooklyn federal judge wrote in an October order. Cook specifically addressed the Act in a memo to Apple employees obtained by BuzzFeed, writing, “We feel the best way forward would be for the government to withdraw its demands under the All Writs Act and, as some in Congress have proposed, form a commission or other panel of experts on intelligence, technology and civil liberties to discuss the implications for law enforcement, national security, privacy and personal freedoms.”
The DOJ also accused Apple, in a court filing yesterday in a completely different case, of being misleading about its past compliance with orders directed under the All Writs Act. “Apple stated that it had “objected” to some of the orders,” Robert Capers, who replaced Loretta Lynch as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, wrote. “That is misleading. Apple did not file objections to any of the orders, seek an opportunity to be heard from the court, or otherwise seek judicial relief.” The New York Times reported on Sunday that Apple regularly complies with court orders to allow federal prosecutors into iCloud accounts.
In an interview with the Financial Times published this morning (but presumably conducted before the DOJ’s latest move), Bill Gates appeared to side with the FBI. “This is a specific case where the government is asking for access to information,” he said. “They are not asking for some general thing, they are asking for a particular case … It is no different than [the question of] should anybody ever have been able to tell the phone company to get information, should anybody be able to get at bank records. Let’s say the bank had tied a ribbon round the disk drive and said ‘don’t make me cut this ribbon because you’ll make me cut it many times.’” As of press time Apple has yet to respond to Gates’s assertion that the iPhone security system is as arbitrary as some ribbon tied around a hard drive. Gates later walked back his statements (a bit) on Bloomberg TV.
And this constant jockeying is going on all day, everyday, about all manner of topics. The backlog on the Stan Confessions is likely enormous. On the site’s FAQ, a flowchart warns those submitting entries that it will probably take at least three months for confessions to appear on the site, the result of every entry needing a bespoke Photoshopped image. Currently, there is a temporary ban on Taylor Swift confessions.
But following the Stan Confessions’ stream reveals it as a sounding board for almost any opinion. Some of them may be tongue-in-cheek, but nothing on the Stan Confessions ever seems sarcastic or disingenuous.
The most infamous rule on the internet is 4chan’s Rule 34: “If it exists, there is porn of it.” It’s a crude statement, that holds up surprisingly well (you can test this yourself; I don’t recommend it). But the central tenet of Rule 34 can be transmogrified into a more all-ages rule of the internet, which is, “If it exists, someone is a fan of it.”
Eventually, a vocabulary starts to emerge. Celebs “slay,” they are “iconic,” those who are ignored are “slept on.” Those who are to be imitated are “goals.” Stans of competitors are challenged to answer the eternal question: “When will your fave ever?” That’s when this blog is the most compelling; when that template for stanning is applied, in a genuine way, to the most unexpected, boring, or irrelevant topics.
Does Bill Gates really need adolescents on Tumblr defending him? Not at all, but it’s endearing to see it happen anyway.
This post has been updated with comment from the blog’s author, Emily.
This was the magic of the internet in its earliest days. Social outcasts, niche hobbyists, and others with very specific interests discovered that, though isolated in real life, they could find like-minded people online. Message boards, listservs, IRC, and on and on.
That concept — that literally every permutation of every single opinion on any subject is floating out there in cyberspace — is why I love the Stan Confessions.
Started in early 2012, the Stan Confessions is a Tumblr run by a Belgian woman named Emily, along with a small team of helpers and moderators. Stans (a portmanteau of “stalker” and “fan” popularized by an Eminem song) submit their opinions via Tumblr’s Ask function, and those submissions are edited onto photos, pasted into a white box in generic Times New Roman font, and uploaded to the blog.
The Stan Confessions was borne out of Emily’s dissatisfaction with other confession blogs. “I couldn’t really submit any negative confessions, for one” she wrote over email. “Every confession posted was praising that celebrity in particular.” Negativity and debate are key to keeping submissions on TSC rolling in. Additionally, most of those blogs are single-topic, rather than looking at the full spectrum of pop culture. As of now, The Stan Confessions is edging up on 54,000 followers and Emily says she spends an hour a day working through submissions. She attributes part of the blog’s success to the fact that users can contribute anonymously. “They don’t have to worry about being judged for their opinion,” she says. “It’s like, in real life you can’t talk about Harry Styles all day … but you can go online and read, confess and obsess about Harry all you want. Especially because other people do it, too.”
Many of the entries revolve around expected topics for the Tumblr crowd: female pop stars, boy bands, Disney movies, Ryan Murphy TV shows, etc. But they’re all part of an ongoing passive-aggressive conversation about modern pop culture. People feel a consuming amount of ownership over these celebrities and their work. Famous people must be defended at all costs, either by talking them up or putting others down.
Consider this string of subsequent Rita Ora confessions, arranged in chronological order.
In the same speech in which he pitched a xenophobic plan to ban all Muslim immigration to the United States, overripe holiday persimmon Donald Trump also introduced another unhinged plans for fighting terrorism: “closing [the] Internet up.” ISIS is recruiting there, you know. Might as well turn the damn thing off and call it a day.
“We’re losing a lot of people because of the internet. And we have to do something,” Trump said.
Fortunately, Trump knows exactly who can protect the American people from the internet: his fellow billionaire, software pioneer Bill Gates. Who, unbeknownst to many, is also a counterterrorism expert and controls the switch that turns the internet on and off, I guess?
“We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what’s happening. We have to talk to them. Maybe in certain areas, closing that internet up in some way.”
But what about free speech, you ask? Wasn’t the internet supposed to be the most democratic of all technologies? Don’t we (kinda, sorta) have net neutrality? These are foolish questions from the mouth of a fool, sayeth the Donald.
“Somebody will say, ‘Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech.’ These are foolish people, we have a lot of foolish people. We’ve got to maybe do something with the internet because they’re recruiting by the thousands …”
Maybe he’s right. Just burn it all down. It’s mostly coverage of the latest mile markers on Donald Trump’s casual jog toward fascism, anyway.
“When I read about Ms. Melissa Chance Yassini’s post about her daughter, I posted my picture in the Army. I want these precious babies to know that we will not come and grab them out of their homes and hurt them and their families” she wrote.
“They are afraid of us!! We are the force that stands between precious children and the bad guys. So let’s start a hashtag campaign.”
Other service members followed Peek’s example, and that hashtag campaign — #IWillProtectYou — spread across Facebook and Twitter:
Trump may be (inadvertently?) stirring up the hornet’s nest of xenophobia and white nationalism, but he’s also (again, inadvertently?) provoking equal and opposite shows of compassion from the American populous.
Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric — his big talk about deporting Mexican people and closing the United States to Muslims — is a horror to many thinking adults, but those adults can take comfort in knowing that political and practical realities make it unlikely Trump’s extreme measures will ever come to pass. But to an 8-year-old Muslim girl named Sofia, the possibility that the yelling man in the straw wig would send the Army to take her and her family away seemed very real — and very terrifying.
After watching Trump’s now-infamous comments about Muslims on the news with her grandmother, Sofia knew what she had to do.
“She had began collecting all her favorite things in a bag in case the army came to remove us from our homes,” her mom, Melissa Chance Yassini, wrote in a Facebook post. “She checked the locks on the door 3-4 times. This is terrorism. No child in America deserves to feel that way.”
Members of the U.S. military, which is not yet under the authority of commander-in-chief the Donald, agreed with Sofia’s mom. They began reaching out to the little girl on social media, assuring her that the army isn’t coming to tear her from her home, and promising to protect her and her family.
According to Upworthy, Army vet and mother Kerri Peek was the first to reach out to Sofia and her mom.
“Salamalakum Melissa!” Peek wrote. “Please show this picture of me to your daughter. Tell her I am a Mama too and as a soldier I will protect her from the bad guys.”
Then she reached out to her fellow service members, her “Battle Buddies,” and asked them to help reassure Sofia and other scared children that they don’t hate Muslims.
The main limitation of today’s video-game controllers is that you can’t have sex with them. At least, that seems to be the reasoning behind VirtuaDolls, the “adult VR game controller” that’s currently hot on crowdfunding platform IndieGogo. In the past five days, 36 people have paid $6,700 for the possibility of penetrating a flesh-colored tube while playing virtual-reality games.
“The amount of passion that has gone into creating a controller with this level of immersion has been incredible,” the creators of VirtuaDolls promise on their IndieGogo page. I bet!
The brainchild of a three-person team out of San Francisco (where else?), VirtuaDolls is basically an interactive Fleshlight, with sensors that detect the player’s “movement” and “position” and affect the game on-screen accordingly.
And by “game,” VirtuaDolls is mainly referring to Girls of Arcadia, a 3-D porn experience they’re developing in-house. The premise of the game involves saving goddesses and fighting monsters — don’t think too hard about how that works — or players can “just pick a girl and continue without fuss.” Don’t stare into the screenshots. If you gaze long into an abyss, an abyss will also gaze into thee. (The controller will also synchronize with “regular” virtual-reality porn, too, in case you were concerned the 36 backers — who paid an average of around 200 bucks — weren’t getting enough for their money.)
There’s also a software development kit for coders who want to make their own games compatible with VirtuaDolls. I know exactly what you’re thinking right now: Will someone play Super Mario Bros. with his dick within the next year of human history? Yes, someone will undoubtedly play Super Mario Bros. with his dick within the next year of human history, if someone hasn’t already.
These are heady times we live in, friend.
Mike Tyson, celebrated boxer and Hangover movie setpiece, has rarely been defeated— not by opponents, by drugs, or by a rape conviction. Despite everything he’s done, everything he’s allegedly done, and everything he hasn’t apologized for, America continues to furnish him with chances. But this week, the soft-voiced, hard-bodied former champ met something he couldn’t overcome: the precarious, non-hovering toy we insist on calling a hoverboard.
It’s been said that Tyson is no Muhammad Ali, and it’s true. He tried to float like a butterfly, and now his sore ass probably stings like a bee. Merry Christmas, champ!
His reaction?
“David said, ‘What the [expletive] is this?’”
But after an explanation — surprisingly, Remnick doesn’t get a lot of LinkedIn spam — the editor was won over. “Let’s just use one,” he said, according to Mankoff.
The cartoon they apparently settled on appeared in print October 5, and you can now buy it as a print from New Yorker publisher Condé Nast. Only $125!
The value of “I’d like to add you to my professional network” is hardly limited to New Yorker non sequiturs, though. It works as a caption for just about anything:
It’s the email message no one wants to receive, the email message that spam filters were made for. Subject line: “I’d like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn.” You don’t know the sender; you only know he’s trying to collect you like a baseball card. This is a depressing, thoroughly modern situation — fortunately, when life gave us LinkedIn, some very funny people used it to make LinkedInade.
For a long time, it’s been held in certain circles that there are a small handful of lines that can be used as the caption to any cartoon in The New Yorker. “Christ, what an asshole” and “What a misunderstanding!” are usually the most-cited captions; in 2011, cartoon editor Bob Mankoff wrote a short column about them.
Now there’s a new contender: In September, a number of websites acknowledged that “Hello, I’d like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn” is the ultimate New Yorker cartoon caption, able to wring a laugh out of even the magazine’s most inscrutable illustrations. Especially the most inscrutable ones.
Writer, designer, and alleged genius Frank Chimero has been credited with discovering the odd synergy between the machine-generated email subject line and the arguably human-generated cartoons, adding “I’d like to add you … ” to the pantheon of universally perfect captions.
But the LinkedIn caption is the only one to have made the leap from in-joke to the actual captions. Chimero’s line was so overwhelmingly great that even longtime New Yorker editor David Remnick succumbed to its brilliance and grudgingly agreed to use it.
“I have a meeting every week with David Remnick, and he makes the final decisions on the cartoons,” Mankoff told The New York Times Magazine Tuesday. “For the first 10 I showed him, I printed the LinkedIn caption on all of them.”
Facebook makes your life easier, yes. It’s getting better and better at automating tasks that we used to trust to our fallible human memory: remembering birthdays and anniversaries and what we angrily typed after our team lost an important game, remembering the embarrassing things we typed to girls in college, and the times we changed our hair after a bad breakup. It’s even getting better at knowing that some of those things are important: New job? Marriage? Birth of a child? These are the gimmes. We all tell Facebook about these milestones with the same set of easy-to-parse keywords: start this new adventure, the rest of our lives together, welcome to the world (lbs. weight, oz. weight, in. length). Our friends’ congratulations add further weight to these events in the minds of the machines.
As a database of memories, Facebook is great. We’re hit with more information per day than the people of any other time in history. Our brains, our capacity to remember — they are not designed for this. They need help from a server farm and a user interface. That’s just where we are, and Facebook helps us cope. This is, if not a good thing, at least something that’s widely in demand (Facebook started showing us our memories On This Day after an app called Timehop proved it was something people wanted).
But as an engine for providing context, Facebook leaves much to be desired. It guesses some memories are important, but it doesn’t know why. It doesn’t know which ones are painful, and which are irrelevant. It can guess who our friends are, but it often guesses badly — it doesn’t know that if we have 45 friends in common with someone but haven’t added them, there’s probably a reason.
And it shouldn’t. That messy context? Those complicated relationships that can’t be reduced to “friend” or “not-friend”? Those are basic parts of being a human being. They’re the most enjoyable parts, and sometimes the most difficult and damaging, but they make us who we are. Doing that work is living life, and Facebook can’t live life for us.
Yet. In the company’s ideal future, maybe it could. Maybe every code would be cracked and every one of us would be reduced to little chunks of (very marketable!) Big Data as we go screaming toward the singularity and all become transhuman. Or something. Who knows?
We’re not there yet. Right now, we’re just aware that the more Facebook understands about us, the more insight it can sell. That’s partially why we recoil at our Friends Day videos, at Facebook nakedly demonstrating how much it still doesn’t know about us. It’s not that we’d rather see Facebook get this stuff right, understand us the way a friend would. We’d rather not see it try at all, because Facebook is not our friend.
The tone-deafness of Facebook recap videos is something worse than a brand saying “bae.” It’s a brand saying, “Bae, I’m a piece of corporate technology that’s only been around for 12 years, but really, I’ve been with you since birth. I’ll always be with you. Bae, I’m your friend. I’ll ‘never miss a memory.’”
We just wanted a box to put our photos in.
In honor of its 12th anniversary, Facebook has released a new video feature that looks back on its last dozen years as a corporate entity by looking back on the last dozen years of your life — collating into an animated video with a jaunty piano soundtrack and a bunch of photos you’ve shared, ostensibly of your friends. “Here are your friends,” it tells you, as a disembodied hand lays out Polaroid versions of your Facebook photos. “You’ve done a lot together. Your friends are pretty awesome.”
It’s the latest in a long line of Facebook features we didn’t ask for, celebrating “memories” we don’t really have. You can find yours here. It’s terrible. My Friends Day video makes it appear that my only friend is my wife (not true, I swear!).
The Friends Day video has all the same weaknesses as Facebook’s other attempts to mine your memories and friendships — the recurring “On This Day” feature and the year-end videos it creates. Or 2014’s “A Look Back, which you may remember as the saccharine “this was your life”–style retrospective that dredged up your first moments on the site, and the other moments and photos Facebook deemed most significant, presenting them in an aggressively sentimental style that wouldn’t be out of place at a wedding. Or a funeral.
Worse than the unsettling feeling that you’re watching a slideshow at your wake is feeling that the slideshow was put together by shuffling a deck of photos and grabbing the top 25. Traumatic moments and broken relationships are facts of life, and sometimes we need to dredge them up … but on our own terms, not as a nasty surprise in the middle of a frivolous Facebook video.
And then there are the weird, funny, or just irrelevant mistakes. Some of my friends were invited to fondly look back on their relationships with internet memes they posted. “Your friends are pretty awesome.”
Facebook’s attempts to show us our memories assume a certain level of technical literacy on the part of the user, a rudimentary understanding of why mistakes and embarrassments happen, and a willingness to forgive the machines (and their parent corporation) guessing which data points we’ll care about the most. It’s true: The machines couldn’t know they were asking you to recall the good times with your abusive ex, or asking if you remember a friend’s funeral, or treating some meme you screen-grabbed from Twitter like a precious memory. It’s no one’s “fault” that you’re seeing these things. There’s no human with human intentions on whom you can hang the blame, just a lot of code that’s very good at processing the raw data of your life, measuring “engagement,” and making guesses about relationships. That meme must have been important: Look how many of your friends “liked” it!
But the disconnect feels especially awkward given the site’s warm, “human” tone. Hey, buddy! Remember this? Some great times we’ve had here. Is Facebook a blameless machine, or your hapless pal who’s sorry he brought that up? Facebook would like to have it both ways.
Can you copyright a lifestyle spread over the internet? That’s the question at the heart of a new lawsuit against Airbnb filed by a French couple who claim that the startup copied their apartment’s interior decorating for its headquarters in San Francisco after renting the apartment for a Paris launch party.
Well, “claim” isn’t exactly right. Airbnb literally replicated the couple’s aesthetic, as BuzzFeed reports. Overlaid photos show the eerie similarity: There are the same pendant lamps, a copycat cabinet, art by the same artists, and even an equally retro fridge. Benjamin Dewé and Zoé de Las Cases run a small interior-design firm, so the appropriation was quite a shock.
The couple’s lawsuit argues that Airbnb’s theft hurts their business and infringes on their ownership of their unique style. “They are branding their company with our life,” Dewé told BuzzFeed. But Airbnb makes no bones about copying popular apartments for its office — other destinations have been replicated as well. Under U.S. copyright law, a style, or a certain collection of objects placed together, isn’t protected by copyright, but the couple is hoping that France’s stricter culture laws will at least force Airbnb into a settlement.
The French couple is arguing that the way they curated (the internet’s favorite word) the objects in their apartment constitutes a product that they own, and that Airbnb can’t infringe on it without some kind of arrangement. Could the same be said of a certain aesthetic of GIFs or found images collected on a Tumblr or Pinterest? The internet is a great way to communicate your sense of style, but it also makes it much easier for that style to be copied down to the last detail, and there’s not much you can do about it — in the U.S., at least.
Creative reuse — appropriating an aesthetic or image and transforming it until it’s something new — is perfectly legal. This case is more akin to knockoff luxury bags: pretty much the same, except for a few details. For Dewé and de Las Cases, it’s a little too late. Airbnb already got everything, down to their particolored wallpaper and small gray bench lined with cushions.
But what about:
That looks pretty legit. It’s got the right font, the right spacing, the verified blue checkmark, the whole shebang.
But guess what? That tweet … is fake. It was really easy to doctor, in fact, so long as you have a rudimentary understanding of web development. I’m going to show you how.
First, we’ll hit some basics. All web pages are built on a language called HyperText Markup Language, otherwise known as HTML (most now also employ other languages like JavaScript, but we don’t have to worry about that). Whenever you load a web page, your browser downloads that page’s HTML file from a server, and stores it locally on your computer. Within that local copy, you can do whatever you want.
Most modern web browsers offer developer tools that let you peek under a page’s hood and edit these local HTML files. For the purposes of this demo, we’re going to use Chrome.
Let’s have some fun with Donald Trump now. The first step is to right-click the text you want to edit and select “Inspect Element.”
This will open up the browser tools and let you look at the page’s HTML. It will even scroll through the code and highlight the parts that correspond to the part of the page you clicked on. Seen here, as I mouse over the part of the HTML containing the Donald’s tweet text, it’s highlighted on the page itself.
In an online era in which everything is a hoax, the screenshot carries with it an inherent air of authenticity. Screenshots can be subliminally assumed to be authentic, mostly because they are more difficult to doctor than text. This week, a Twitter user named @BISCUITS faked a DM conversation with Trump, eventually getting more than 100,000 retweets.
Now comes the fun part. Double-click on the HTML containing the tweet text, which allows you to edit it. (You might need to uncollapse this section of code by clicking the gray arrows on the left.) Type in whatever you want and hit enter.
There it is, a fake tweet that looks just like the real thing. This is because you’re only editing a small part of the code and retaining much of the original. Modern websites are generally styled using CSS, which dictates everything from font choice, sizing, and formatting to the spacing between different parts of the page.
You can take it to the next level and edit other elements of the page including the number of interactions and time of publication. If it’s text you can highlight, it can be altered. If you want to take it a step further and are handy with how HTML handles images, you can swap out those as well.
This method works on pretty much any web page. It works on Facebook, for instance.
It works on the websites of well-respected and generally reliable news publications.
And now you know how to fake a screenshot all on your own.
To recap: "Inspect Element" Double-click to edit Enjoy the result
The larger point I’m trying to make here — other than the fact that goofing around is very fun — is that screenshots are incredibly easy to fake, and that anyone with a modern browser has the tools to do so. In reality, they’re no less verifiable than plaintext. That’s why when Twitter revoked the API access of Politwoops, which archived the deleted tweets of politicians, the alternative method of taking screenshots was seen as a less-than-perfect solution. So, if you see someone passing around a screenshot on social media claiming that it’s legit, a healthy dose of skepticism is in order.
Faking screenshots of public figures saying odd things is something of a running joke online — especially for verbose blowhards like Trump — and the format of wrapping the quote in a social-media aesthetic that signifies off-the-cuff frankness heightens the joke. (I love to explain jokes.)
I can, for example, write:
But it’s not convincing at all. Anyone can mash the tiny letter buttons on their keyboard, and literally attribute any quote to literally anyone else! It’s easy!
As Kotaku explains, Undertale has a number of qualities that contribute to its reputation as an “SJW game,” including gay relationships, androgynous characters, and the ability to go through the game with no combat whatsoever.
For game critics — or people who think critically about games in general — these were selling points, things that made Undertale unique and valuable. Clearly, it has an audience that feels a strong connection to it.
But that only makes it more mystifying to traditional gamers. How could an indie game compete with the venerated classics that shaped their childhoods? They don’t even have to play it to know.
But when the haters do give it a chance, it tends to win them over:
Imagine that.
Undertale is an unconventional video game that combines the flavor of an old-school 16-bit role-playing game with the option to avoid every battle and empathize with the creatures you meet. Critics love it. And, on Tuesday, it beat the beloved Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time in a poll to determine the “Best Game Ever.” A certain subset of gamers is Very Mad about this.
As one GameFAQs poster perfectly put it, “Only time will tell if this game gets remembered, but I’ll remember the FlameFaqs Undertale war of 2015 for many years to come. The salt levels were almost lethal, and I loved it.”
Although it was just released this year, Undertale has a highly dedicated fan base. They love this game, and they vote. The little game that could has overcome established titles throughout the GameFAQs poll, besting Fallout 3, two Mario Games, and Super Smash Bros. Melee on its way to a finals victory against Ocarina of Time.
But self-proclaimed “real gamers” are having trouble accepting that a relatively new game could slay their faves, and they’re accusing the Undertale fans of being outsiders and trolls who ruined the poll.
Here’s a taste of the salty comments being posted on the GameFAQs forum for Undertale, and elsewhere:
“Atrocious battle system. Every area looks the same. 8 bit graphics..cmon… … Personally I think this guys uncle works for gamefaqs that’s why he was put up there. I don’t think it’s right to be given this credit for a game that a 8yr could make.”
“I’m not going to buy Undertale as a result of the contest … I suppose it shouldn’t be surprising that people would rally around a troll entry in an online popularity contest … I think this is the best way to get right back at all the Undertrolls — their actions have actually cost the developer money.”
“The reason this game is winning on the poll is because it’s a really craptastic game and people love crap. I mean you have to have the mental capacity of a brain damaged baboon to think this game is worth the 10 dollars spent on it. … The game is weak in every aspect. Honestly flabbergasted it was made in the first place.”
Another aspect of the hatred for Undertale comes from the place everyone’s favorite online hate movement came from: the false dichotomy between “real gamers” and “Social Justice Warriors” who want to “ruin” video games with nontraditional gameplay and minority representation.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed today that it has found a working method for unlocking the iPhone belonging to Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters. Thus, the biggest tech court case in years ends prematurely with a whimper. The method — which was brought to light just hours before the first hearing — is not specified, but the fact that it came from outside Apple complete dismantles the FBI’s own argument that only Apple could help them unlock the phone.
Still, there are a few major takeaways from this case. The first is that this type of fight over encryption and mobile-device access will happen again (in fact, it’s already happening in dozens of criminal investigations). As tech companies step up their encryption mechanisms, law enforcement will continue trying to build a legal precedent for backdoor methods.
Hand in hand with this case’s resolution is the manner in which it was resolved: The FBI broke security on an iPhone. That’s not good! It is not a very fun or encouraging thing to find out that the government can access devices that you once considered secure. I bet Apple is gonna have a fun time building a PR campaign to reestablish how secure their devices are.
And speaking of PR, this whole case was embarrassing for the FBI, which learned that, rather than publicly attempting to gain legal access to millions of phones at once, maybe they should just take their work over to the NSA instead.
And Jeb sporting the classic “turtleneck and chain” creeper uniform:
If you can’t be president, the least you can do is have a little bit of fun while the entire campaign burns to rubble around you.
Jeb Bush, once considered a shoo-in to continue his family’s sterling track record of winning Republican presidential primaries, is polling a tepid 3 percent according to the latest New York Times/CBS numbers. At this point, he has nothing to lose by just retweeting sweet Photoshops of himself from Reddit, so that’s exactly what he did on Thursday evening.
That photo, an edit of an iconic shot by grunge photographer Charles Peterson, was an entry in a Reddit “Photoshop battle” inspired by an image that the original poster described as “Jeb Bush getting felt up at a rally.”
Many contestants picked up on Bush’s almost-sexual vibe in the photo, creating some images that even a struggling Republican presidential candidate couldn’t get away with retweeting.
There’s Joe Biden whispering sweet nothings in Jeb’s ear:
There’s Jeb as Sex Pistol Sid Vicious:
What Apple really cares about, above all else, is its ability to continue to sell phones. If Apple went ahead and followed the judge’s orders, every iPhone or iPad it sold from then on would come with an asterisk: Law enforcement, if it so chose, even if you protected your phone with a passcode, could access the device. It would stain the company’s reputation for a long time. According to a Pew Research Center report from last month, “some 74% say it is ‘very important’ to them that they be in control of who can get information about them, and 65% say it is ‘very important’ to them to control what information is collected about them.”
This is a case of corporate and customer interests aligning against government snooping. Apple is not for the customer, it is for itself. The Apple that Tim Cook claims cares deeply about American citizens manufactures almost none of its products domestically, outsourcing most of its jobs to China. At a dinner at the White House, President Obama once asked Steve Jobs about the issue directly. His response was unequivocal: “Those jobs aren’t coming back.” Tim Cook might not be Steve Jobs reincarnate, but he was a protégé. Jobs and his management style have practically been deified by this point. His office in Cupertino has sat untouched since 2011.
The jobs that Apple does create in the United States are for its Apple Store employees, and most of them earn standard service-economy wages. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2012 that Apple Store workers were paid anywhere between $9 and $15 per hour, with Genius Bar technicians in the ballpark of $30. That would put a salesperson’s salary at about $30,000 per year, and double for a Genius Bar worker. In 2011, the New York Times calculated, “each Apple store employee — that includes non-sales staff like technicians and people stocking shelves — brought in $473,000.”
Similarly, Apple has a financial structure that allows it to stash money overseas rather than paying taxes in the United States. For years it used a scheme known as a Double Irish arrangement to avoid paying taxes. As the New York Times wrote in 2012, “Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places like Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands — some little more than a letterbox or an anonymous office — that help cut the taxes it pays around the world.” A recent overview from Citizens for Tax Justice finds that Apple would owe the U.S. government nearly $60 billion if its profits were not held offshore. Addressing the issue last year, Cook told Charlie Rose, “There’s no truth behind it. Apple pays every tax dollar we owe.” That’s a semantic dodge — Apple has, put simply, structured itself to owe less.
So yes, Apple’s stand against the FBI is the right one. If you want to reward Apple for doing the right thing, buy its products. (As the programmer Alice Maz puts it, “‘major tech companies compete to be the most hostile toward government’ is like, gold standard of how markets should operate.”) But it’s also what we should expect. Don’t pat it on the back or excuse its other horrible behavior. This isn’t a case where a shining hero took on a powerful villain. It’s a case where two powerful villains fought, and the goals of one happen to be our goals, too. Make no mistake — Apple claiming to look out for American citizens and American democracy is a crock. Apple cares about precisely one thing: Its ability to sell you a phone.
Apple CEO Tim Cook’s refusal to help the FBI access an encrypted phone is an important and unprecedented event in the long, strained relationship between Silicon Valley and the government. But there is one particular line, near the end of his letter, that sticks out: “We are challenging the FBI’s demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of our country.” Quite frankly, that’s bullshit.
This is not to say that Apple’s refusal to comply is wrong. If we take Apple’s word that the order amounts to building a back door into its devices for the purposes of government investigation, to fight it is absolutely the right move — the government should not have, in Cook’s words, “a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks.”
Nor is it to say that Cook — or any one of Apple’s employees — doesn’t have a genuine commitment to privacy, security, and civil liberties. I don’t know the guy!
But Apple, the institution — Apple, the publicly traded corporation — is taking its stand not out of any moral obligation, but out of financial self-preservation. Remember: [extremely dorm-room voice] Apple’s goal is to maximize shareholder returns. Apple cares about American democracy only to the extent that the continued existence of American democracy affects its profit margins. It cares about you only to the extent that you are a current or future consumer of its products. Which is why it’s weird to read over-the-top praise of Apple’s stand:
Many of the company’s revenue streams are declining to a total of an estimated $3.5 billion in 2016, down from $4.1 billion the year prior.
Detailed answers to prospective buyers won’t be provided until the next round of bids. Initial bids are due next Monday. Most of the people Re/code spoke to are planning to make a bid, driven by the complex logic of “Eh, why the hell not?”
Yahoo, the home page for people who don’t know what home pages are, is in trouble. Well, in more trouble than was previously thought: According to two separate reports this week, the company’s media business is in disarray and its presentation to potential buyers is suspiciously complicated.
Since Marissa Mayer took over as CEO four years ago, the company has spent most of its time trying to figure out what it is, exactly, besides the punch line to a joke. A search engine? A web portal? A very large publisher? Tumblr’s slowly dying parent company? It’s surviving, obviously, but mainly for the same reasons that it takes longer to hit the ground when you’re falling from very high up.
Our first sign that Yahoo is in even more trouble than previously thought comes from a Vanity Fair report concerning the company’s media business, which tried to reinvent itself shortly after Mayer’s hire, by hiring and poaching numerous marquee media names, most notably Katie Couric. But what these big media personalities encountered when they arrived at Yahoo was a tech company that heavily favored data when making decisions.
This resulted in writers quite literally competing for attention with articles about Kim Kardashian’s butt — a competition which, if you’ve spent any time online at all, you know you’ll lose.
Now, the media department is scaling back its focus to four main sections — news, sports, finance, and lifestyle — and getting rid of employees in the process. Of global editor-in-chief Martha Nelson, one employee told Vanity Fair, “she thought she was being invited to the party, and then she showed up and they handed her a broom.”
Another source told Vanity Fair the company was reverting to its beginnings as “a crap home page for the Midwest.” Rude, blunt, but, also … not wrong.
Meanwhile, Re/code’s Kara Swisher got a hold of Yahoo’s sale “book” — the prospectus being given to potential buyers. She describes it as “straightforwardly showing a successful, growing business.” No, kidding, obviously: Swisher calls it “unusually confusing and perhaps purposefully so,” and describes its contents as portraying a “financial meltdown” at “a company in what has been a serious free fall[.]”
One Amazon reviewer suggested the unexpected change in sound effects might have been intentional sabotage, a clever political commentary by someone with access to a toy factory. Hilarious and amazing if true, but there’s probably a simpler explanation.
Judging by the negative reviews, it doesn’t sound like the quality control for a toy brand you’ve never heard of was all that stringent — shocking, I know! Even the planes that played the right sounds reportedly came apart easily.
We’ll probably never know for sure how this happened — the company behind the toy, Brooklyn-based Wolvol, doesn’t seem to have a working website anymore, and the plane is only available on Amazon through third-party sellers.
This Christmas, some parents just wanted to give their kids a toy plane that rolls along the ground and changes directions when it bumps into things, playing music and fighter-jet sounds as it goes. But when they unwrapped and assembled their F16s, they found that the toy symbols of U.S. military might didn’t make jet-engine sounds — they played “a Muslim prayer spoken during pilgrimages to Mecca.” Well, that’s slightly awkward.
The mix-up made the news in Washington State, and Amazon reviews of the WolVol Bump & Go Action Electric F16 Military Fighter Jet Aircraft Airplane Toy with Lights and Sounds confirm it wasn’t an isolated incident.
Some of the reviews are clearly jokes written by people who don’t own the toy.
But others are from dissatisfied purchasers who describe the prayer in Arabic as “weird and scary,” “un-American,” “bizarre,” “annoying,” and “creepy.” In Donald Trump’s America, I guess we should just be thankful that no one called the defective plane a “terrorist” toy.
And, to be fair, practicing Muslims aren’t especially thrilled about a prayer coming out of a toy fighter jet, either.
“It’s very wrong. It’s very, very wrong,” said Nadeem Israr, president of the Islamic Society of Whatcom County, the Washington county where the toy made local news.
Are you ready for “International Tribal Meetup Day”? It doesn’t really matter if you are, because it’s happening anyway — this Saturday, all around the world, at 8 p.m.
“International Tribal Meetup Day” is the brainchild of Roosh Valizadeh, better known as RooshV, among the most successful and best known of the loose community of social incompetents that have banded together online as MRAs — Men’s Rights Activists. MRAs are generally aspiring pickup artists and aggrieved men who believe that masculinity itself is under attack. That’s not an exaggeration; the topic is often discussed in military terms. As an MRA ringleader writes of the gatherings, “While many of you certainly have normal friendships, chances are those friends are moderates who may not be dependable in times of crisis, and who may not defend you if a hostile enemy approaches.” So the event is a chance for these MRAs to meet up offline and, I guess, best figure out how to harass women.
A few dozen men have signed up to organize local meetups. The plan is to meet in a public place around 8 p.m. local time and wait around for 20 minutes while other men cautiously approach and say the secret code phrase, and then move to a bar or something.
Yes, there is a code phrase:
So if you see a group of handsome, strong MRAs gathered in an IHOP parking lot on Saturday, do not be alarmed! Maybe feel a little depressed, though. This whole endeavor is depressing. (Full disclosure: I am a beta.)
Here are the top ten MRA meetup locations: Bangor, Maine: “Bangor Public Library, in front of main entrance below the stairs” Rochester Hills, Michigan: “Elizabeth Park, beside center bush” Redwood City, California: “Parking lot of IHOP” San Antonio, Texas: “In front of main door of the Alamo” Charlottesville, Virginia: “Lee Park, beside the statue of [Robert E.] Lee” Novosibirsk, Russia: “Next to the statue of Vladimir Lenin on Lenin Square” Seattle, Washington: “Statue of Lenin” Phnom Penh, Cambodia: “The royal palace in front of main entrance” Dubai, UAE: “Dubai Mall, in front of Tim Horton” Boston, Massachusetts: “Paul Revere Statue in Paul Revere Mall”
No surprise, there is chatter online about disrupting the meetups.
Facebook is reportedly considering adding “tipping” to its stable of revenue options, letting users make micro-payments to one another as a show of appreciation. That Facebook would start floating these ideas shortly after the official launch of its own streaming platform is hardly surprising, but for many people (the vast majority of Facebook’s billion-plus user base) it may seem odd. Web users in general and Facebook users in particular expect things for free — the company has never charged its users for basic content or for functionality.
According to the Verge, Facebook is polling users and gauging reaction to new ways for users to monetize posts, including via the popular tip-jar format prevalent on streaming sites like Twitch and YouNow. The ideas — which are, for now, just ideas — include “branded content, and taking a cut of the ad revenue Facebook earns from posts” as well as calls to action and ways to make a donation.
But real-time sharing has changed how people interact online. Live performance, by its very nature, generates a certain type of response, and the online tip jar is not that different from the musician’s open guitar case on the subway platform. Facebook’s already stated that live video generates ten times more comments than taped video, and if Twitch is any indication, users are willing to fork over more money during live video as well. It helps to think of live video as a pledge drive: If you’re enjoying the entertainment, why not chip in a few bucks.
Facebook examining other monetization methods and trying to bring them in-house was an inevitability, because tip jars and the like will happen whether Facebook wants them to or not. Now that the company has opened up live video via an API, users will soon be able to customize their broadcasts in the same style as on Twitch, adding graphic overlays, tickers, and leaderboards encouraging contributions. On Twitch, à la carte tipping happens via third-party services, meaning that Twitch sees none of that money (it earns revenue through a variety of other ad and subscription options).
When I spoke to Twitch’s head of programming back in January, he spoke positively and enthusiastically about the large number of payments circumventing Twitch’s system, but was hesitant to admit to wanting a slice. If these preliminary surveys are any indication, Facebook knows that as it expands live-video functionality, tipping is an inevitability. If they can develop a first-party tip jar that’s easier to integrate — and more importantly, that they can take a cut from — then creators can expect to see a lot more money flow through the Facebook ecosystem.
A sampling:
RIP, the Most Interesting Man in the World, dead on Mars.
A decade after he first hit the scene, Dos Equis’s Most Interesting Man in the World will soon be no more. News broke Wednesday morning that the beer brand will be retiring Jonathan Goldsmith, the actor who played the character, with a new ad campaign as it attempts to stay relevant.
From Ad Age:
The character, henceforth referred to as MIMITW, was one of the first ad campaigns to truly be adopted by the burgeoning meme community. His mutable slogan, “I don’t always X, but when I do, I Y,” seems in retrospect ready-made for memedom.
At first glance, MIMITW’s appeal seems aspirational. People want to be interesting! Dos Equis’s actual ad campaign likened him to a white-collar Chuck Norris, accomplishing amazing feats and looking suave while doing it. (Goldsmith himself is something of a character: He lives on a 47-foot boat.)
But the MIMITW rendered online was reflexive and self-deprecating. It elevated the mundanity of our day-to-day existence — especially that which occurs mostly in front of a computer monitor — into something a little more special. His catchphrase was particularly popular on Reddit.
Twitter genius Karen Zack has one question for you: Is this a dog or a piece of food?
It seems straightforward enough to answer (you know what a duckling looks like, I hope; same with a bagel) and yet, when you’re staring into the sweet blueberry eyes of what very well may be a dog — and when it’s, you know, the time of day that Zack is screenshotting her galleries — who’s to say where “chihuahua” ends and “muffin” begins?
"I’ve been making these animal/food comparison tweets for a while. After the first one my brain just kept looking for possible matches," Zack told Food and Wine. This is the closest any of us will ever come to being the hungry guy in a cartoon to whom everything appears as a juicy drumstick.
That’s just classic Finland. You step off the plane (or boat?? Unclear) to Finland and before you can say, “One sauna, please!” they’ve directed you to the sauna.
The Headbanger
Is Finland metal? Yes, they love heavy metal. According to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, “It is dark in Finland and so is the music. There’s a small headbanger living inside of each Finn.” That sounds like a threat!
All of this is, of course, a ploy by the Finnish tourism industry to get us to blog about Finland, so, uh, they did that. These aren’t coming to your phone anytime soon unless the Unicode Consortium is metal as hell.
If you were to construct a set of emoji for Finland, what icons would you use? Here’s what I’d use: the flag of Finland … and I don’t know what else, to be honest (also, I cannot describe what the Finnish flag looks like).
That’s a problem, which is why the country has become the first to propose a set of country-specific symbols espousing its heritage and culture. Three of the 30 in total were revealed this week. “We have been anything but serious when creating these emojis. Hopefully they will open up not only our weirdness but also our strengths of which unarming honesty is one example,” said Petra Theman, director for public diplomacy at the nation’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
Here are the emoji:
The Nokia 3310
Did you know that Nokia is a Finnish company? I knew that, but some people don’t. The 3310 is the web’s meme phone. There’s tons of great content out there about how the 3310 is basically indestructible. You could kill a man with one of these (I’VE HEARD). Do you remember the ’90s? This phone was popular during that decade. You or your parents had one, I bet.
The Sauna
@MoMArobot shares images from MoMA’s vast digital archive. It’s one of many museum-collection bots Emerson has made based on Darius Kazemi’s original @MuseumBot.
Created by: John Emerson
John Emerson (@FISAbot, @NYTanon): “The bot tweets images of random objects from the Museum of Modern Art collection four times a day. The bot was inspired by Darius Kazemi’s @MuseumBot, which does the same for objects in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The range of the MoMA collection covers a wide swath of the 19th and 20th century, so it makes for a nice surprise. I always love the Russian avant garde typography. The bot’s followers really dig the mid-century modern product designs whenever those pop up.”
@Twoheadlines draws from Google News, automatically combining the subject of one headline with the action of another.
Created by: Darius Kazemi
Rob Dubbin (@blahfuture, @worstvsworst): “I like the classics: @twoheadlines and @everyword got popular for a reason.”
Darius Kazemi (@sortingbot, @wowsoportland): “Part of the reason it’s funny is it’s timely — it’s always talking about what’s in the news right now because it’s pulling from Google News. The other advantage is that, much like Twitter, news headlines have a very specific way they’re written, both within publications and across publications. Like all entertainment headlines, all politics headlines, kind of all look the same. So seeing a headline about Beyoncé written the way you’d see a finance headline is very funny. Similarly, seeing a headline about Barack Obama in a way that you’d normally see a B-list celebrity written about is funny. It plays with the convention of headline-writing itself and subverts those expectations. Its hit rate is very high. Probably four or five tweets a day are very funny, which is a pretty high hit rate for a bot.”
Bots can be the absolute worst part of Twitter. They can also be the best. In the last few years, artists and programmers have turned Twitter bots into an internet-native art form, producing bots that are often hilarious, usually weird, and sometimes unexpectedly poetic. Some recontextualize words (@everyword) or images (@museumbot), while others leverage Twitter’s flexibility to produce commentary (@thinkpiecebot), journalism (@congressedits), or generative art (@greatartbot), sparking amusing or illuminating juxtapositions in your timeline.
@Nice_tips_bot shares life advice from Wikihow to brighten your day.
Created by: @Thricedotted
Dubbin: “I love it because it takes something that could be dry — scraped text from WikiHow articles — and imbues it with personality. This bot feels like a well-meaning fairy that pops into my timeline to offer earnest, sometimes urgent advice, and that tone stays consistent even if the advice is terrible or self-destructive out of its original context. I’m a huge fan of all of @thricedotted’s work, they really go that extra mile to give their bots character.”
Thricedotted: “This bot was sort of a ‘spinoff’ of @wikisext, which kicked off my interest in using content from WikiHow in a few projects. Some articles on WikiHow include “tips” at the end, and I imagined @nice_tips_bot as a well-intentioned friend who just wants to help folks with the occasional out-of-context reminder. Compared to some other bots I’ve made, it’s very simple from a technical perspective — it ultimately depends most on the content it pulls from WikiHow to remain interesting. But it still has a distinctive voice in its framing of this content, and that’s something that’s very important to me and the way that I imagine people interacting with my bots. They are not fully fleshed personalities within themselves, but if a person is willing to bridge a narrative together from the bot’s tweets, some really neat interactions can arise.”
@NYPDedits tweets anonymous Wikipedia edits made from IP addresses in the NYPD.
Emerson: “I’d say my most important bot is NYPDedits, though it has not tweeted since April 2015. The bot monitors Wikipedia in real time for anonymous edits from IP addresses registered to the New York City Police Department. The bot was inspired by an article by Kelly Weill in Capital New York exposing anonymous edits from NYPD IP addresses to Wikipedia pages containing details of alleged police brutality, NYPD scandals, and well-known victims of police altercations, including entries for Eric Garner, Sean Bell, and Amadou Diallo. Since I launched the bot, it caught a few edits before going silent — including Walking Dead spoilers in an article about actor Tyler James Williams. (His father is an NYPD sergeant.) Since April no new anonymous edits have appeared — though the bot is still watching. The bot has a wide range of followers, activists, journalists, and concerned citizens interested in holding police to account. It was mentioned in a couple of follow-ups to Kelly’s piece, and seems to have had an impact on police editing.”
@poem_exe generates “micropoetry” based on a technique used by the Oulipo poet Raymond Queneau.
Why Twitter? Its 140-character constraint is perfect for bot-making, says Darius Kazemi, a prolific bot-maker (he’s made something like 50 Twitter bots, and many more on other social-media platforms) and organizer of Bot Summit. “It’s easier to fill 140 characters with something interesting than, like, a Tumblr post, which could be thousands and thousands of words,” he explains. “There’s not a hard expectation on Tumblr of what a Tumblr post should look like and how it should be composed, whereas it’s pretty codified about how to write a tweet. Retweeting, faving, lists — all the basic functionalities that we take for granted are really great for bots.”

Allison Parrish (@eventuallybot, @deepquestionbot): “It’s minimalist, almost peaceful, sometimes hilarious, sometimes sad. I think the success of bots like this one and the Ephemerides lies in the fact that people do actually love poetry (all appearances to the contrary) — we are all so hungry for linguistic serendipity and new meaning and words that behave in unexpected ways. Poetry like this activates parts of the brain often left dormant. That’s part of the power of computer-generated language, I think: It’s a bit divorced from human intention, and all the presuppositions and habits and patterns that go along with that. A good Twitter bot gives us a glimpse of language that comes from a place utterly foreign to our own conventional understanding.”
@soft_focuses is another interesting poetic experiment.
Created by: @thricedotted
Pipkin: “This is a very quiet and mysterious bot from @thricedotted. Thrice is (in my opinion) making some of the most interesting bots on Twitter, and they’ve been a huge influence on me and how people deal with language and corpora (or source material) in that space generally. @soft_focuses is a moderate outlier to the bulk of Thrice’s cannon, which might generally trend a little funnier, or louder. But reading through its output, one is struck by how non-formulaic the tweets are; no simple Ad Libs construction here. It is a technical marvel and also one of the sweetest and kindest things on Twitter. Every time it shows up in my feed, I remember to look out the window.”
@desires_exe is definitively the best 50 Shades of Grey bot.
Created by: Casey Kolderup
Kazemi: “Unconventional Desire is not very popular, but I just love it. There was this meme that was going around when the 50 Shades movie came out. It was this scene where the guy says, ‘My desires are unconventional.’ And she goes, ‘Show me.’ So the reaction shot is just something absurd with the meme. This just grabs random pictures and puts it in that reaction shot. So like, his unconventional desire was a cat in a bow tie. And it’s this steamy sexy scene and all the sudden he’s like, ‘My desires are unconventional …’ with steak and potatoes. I would not call it the best bot out there by far. I could recommend you many better, more artful, possibly even more objectively funny bots, but this is the one that makes me laugh out loud literally every day.”
That combination of formal restriction and frictionlessness has led to the rise of @oliviataters, a bot that mashes up results for Twitter searches for adverbs like literally and truly to create tweets so convincing — and sometimes profound — that Twitter users interact with her as if she’s a real teenage girl, and @everyword, a linguistic experiment (2007-2014) composed of individual tweets of every single word in the English language. But there are so many other creative and useful bots out there that don’t get the attention they deserve. So we spoke to some of our favorite bot-makers about their favorite Twitter bots — their own, and made by others in the #botALLY community — to surface some lesser-known projects worth following.
@RestroomGender is a random restroom-sign generator.
Created by: Tyler Callich
Pipkin: “Perhaps this is my own gender showing, but that bot is really doing the lord’s work; every four hours or so, it produces a new abstract gender (recently trash goshs, techno acids, monohumans), pairs it with a unicode symbol and braille translation, and tweets an image of a restroom sign. The resulting timeline is pretty cute and funny in and of itself (monohumans! trash goths!) but also points at real issues with public facilities access, transness, and contemporary relationships with bodies that don’t always feel like home.”
@the_ephemerides pulls images from NASA’s OPUS database to pair with computer-generated text.
Created by: Allison Parrish
Parrish: “One of the affordances of generative text in general is satire and humor, and I have made my share of satirical and humorous (and borderline mean-spirited) bots. In making the Ephemerides, I was trying to expand my aesthetic range a little bit, to make something a bit more lyrical and evocative. The poetry is made by remixing two 19th-century texts, one on astrology and the other on oceanography, which combined have the feeling (or are intended to have the feeling) of otherworldly poems about the exotic icy landscapes of the solar system.”
@CensusAmericans, a FiveThirtyEight creation that uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau between 2009 and 2013 to produce mini-biographies of anonymous Americans.
Created by: Jia Zhang
Emerson: “I think CensusAmericans is my favorite bot right now. I find it so poetic. The bot reverse-engineers census data to create tiny snapshots of people’s lives. You catch a glimpse of all this hardship and triumph, joy and sadness, life’s milestones in a flash of 140 characters. It’s a reminder how much work there is to do to repair this country’s tattered social safety net, but also of the time we have with each other, and that every day is a gift.”
@phasechase is a linguistic game taken out of the classroom and shared on Twitter, a project by Rob Dubbin.
Created by: Rob Dubbin
Dubbin: “My favorite bot of mine is probably @oliviataters, but she gets enough attention so I’m going to talk about one that I love but the world at large doesn’t care about as much, which is @phasechase. @phasechase was inspired by a game that one of my smartest elementary school teachers, Mr. Streit, used to play, where you’d start with any word and change one letter to turn it into a different word, then another letter to turn THAT into a different word, and so on. You’d always end up so far away from the word you started with! I loved that little exercise and wanted to fit it into 140 characters, and so @phasechase was born. It often reveals poetic connections between lexical neighbors, and that kind of serendipity is what Twitter bots are all about.”
@Mothgenerator uses Javascript to produce striking renderings of imaginary moths, and then tweets them with faux-scientific names to breathe life into them.
Created by: Katie Rose Pipkin and Loren Schmidt
Katie Rose Pipkin (@100yearsrising, @relationships_js): “The bulk of this bot has nothing to do with Twitter. Instead it is an extremely complicated drawing routine that runs in Javascript, but we ended up using Twitter as a publishing platform. I’m proud of the project in general, but the reason it is my favorite is because it is my first bot that uses the @-reply functionality of Twitter in a constructive way. When someone tweets @mothgenerator, the bot uses the text of that tweet to seed the drawing. The language is translated into a number, on which all of the moth components are based. For example, if you were to tweet your name at it, it would reply with a moth unique to your name and unlike any other moth that it had ever made. And if you were to tweet a tiny variation of your name — perhaps you add a middle initial — it would also alter slightly, maybe the pattern on the wings would shift, or it would be a paler green.”
@Thricedotted (@420worldclock, @wikisext): “@mothgenerator is astounding to me. Every single moth it generates is utterly beautiful and completely unique … its entire aesthetic feels so perfect to me. And the moths themselves are beautiful on their own. But to know that they are being posted by a bot with no human intervention — I find it amazing that the creators found a way to capture this aesthetic so precisely with an algorithm. It just impresses me so much.”
A Wisconsin nursing-home employee has been fired and arrested after allegedly Snapchatting a video of one of the home’s elderly residents, a 93-year-old Alzheimer’s patient, “in a bra and no underwear and no pants.” Yikes.
Grace Riedlinger, a 21-year-old nursing assistant who worked at Parkside Manor in Kenosha until earlier this month, now faces charges of taking a nude video without consent. If convicted, she could spend 18 months in jail and two and a half years on supervised release.
According to the Kenosha News, one of Riedlinger’s school friends, who also follows her on Snapchat, reported the photo to the nursing home. The executive director of Parkside Manor told cops that Riedlinger admitted to taking a video of the elderly patient.
As for why she did it, the criminal complaint against her contains the explanation she gave police. It’s not a great one.
The elderly woman “was playing tug of war with her and she thought it was funny so she took a video of the encounter and uploaded the video to Snapchat under her ‘story’ section,” officers wrote. Unlike regular Snapchat messages, Stories don’t disappear immediately when viewed — they stick around for 24 hours.
Police also interviewed the victim, who has Alzheimer’s and dementia. She wasn’t able to tell them what happened.
This incident isn’t as unusual as you would hope. ProPublica has been tracking cases over the past few years, and has “identified 35 instances since 2012 in which workers at nursing homes and assisted-living centers have surreptitiously shared photos or videos of residents, some of whom were partially or completely naked. At least 16 cases involved Snapchat[.]”
Following the release of ProPublica’s report, the U.S. Senate’s Aging Committee is looking into possibilities for a legislative safeguard against what appears to be a horrifying trend. Things move slowly in Congress, though: A hearing is currently planned for September.
Knowing that, observers were probably less likely to scrutinize the passport for subtle signs of Photoshopping.
And finally, Facebook’s fraught history of strictly enforcing its real-name-only policy makes it perfectly believable that the social network would botch the case of someone with a non-Western name. Just this month, a Facebook executive admitted the real-name policy, which requires some users to verify their accounts with government-issued ID, is broken and announced plans to improve it starting in December.
It’s a real problem, just not Phuc Dat Bich’s real problem.
Last week, the internet rallied around a Vietnamese-Australian man after Facebook allegedly kept shutting down his account merely because of his name: Phuc Dat Bich. Bich, whose name would be pronounced something like “phoo dat bic,” got his account back and posted a heartwarming message thanking fans for their support. And they all lived happily ever after, right? Well, phuc dat, because a former classmate now claims that Bich has hoaxed us all.
Phuc Dat Bich is an actual Vietnamese name, but it apparently doesn’t belong to the man at the center of the controversy. Someone claiming to have known Phuc since his school days told Mashable that his real name is Thien Nguyen, and even provided a yearbook picture as evidence.
Phuc Dat Bich’s story began to unravel from there. Mashable linked the license-plate number of a car seen on Phuc’s Facebook page to Thien Nguyen, and Australian journalists claimed that the passport Bich posted to prove his story was a Photoshopped fake.
Apparently realizing he’d been found out, Bich/Nguyen claimed his name was really Joe Carr (“Joker,” as Mashable helpfully points out) and confessed to the prank in a Facebook post:
“Do you remember the story; The boy who cried wolf?” he wrote. “Imagine that boy grew up into a mischievous man with 21st century technology at his finger tips.”
“It goes to show that an average joe like myself can con the the biggest news sources with ease.”
How did this prank escape the usual skepticism of so many media outlets, though?
It helps that Phuc Dat Bich is a real name — or at least a combination of three real names — that was even used as a cautionary tale about proper Vietnamese pronunciation in this months-old YouTube video:
For months, an anonymous woman on Instagram has been burying her face in a wide variety of breads, making sure to thoroughly smush them so she can properly evaluate their “face feel.” Who is Bread Face, and why is she doing this? A post on Digg asked the question on Wednesday, but didn’t come up with many answers.
Based on the bread products she’s demolished, notably a Bergen bagel, Digg proposes that Bread Face is a New York City resident. She favors pop-rap as her bread-reviewing soundtrack, setting sessions to Fetty Wap and Nelly. Her favorite bread to rub on her face is Wonder, according to her short-lived Tumblr of written bread reviews. This is all we know.
And as for why, why she presses her face into these baked goods with such relish? Because we need her, probably.
#Breadface existed as a hashtag on Instagram long before Bread Face began her bread-facing career, but it mostly refers to patterns in bread that look like faces, or an old forced meme involving wreathing a cat’s head with a piece of toast. There’s no one else out there giving you the real, raw (okay, baked) truth about what different breads feel like against your nose and cheeks.
And someone’s got to do it.
Okay, not really. But aren’t you glad she did?
At the end of “Sorry” — a song from Beyoncé’s latest album, Lemonade, a not-so-subtle castigation of Jay Z for his rumored infidelity — she sings “He better call Becky with the good hair.” But who is Becky?
If you ask most members of the Beyhive, the most pervasive theory is that Becky is fashion designer Rachel Roy. Some background: Before the infamous elevator fight between Solange and Jay Z at the Met Gala in 2014, Solange had reportedly confronted Roy over her “too close for comfort” relationship with Jay. (Wendy Williams called this nearly two years ago.)
Last night after Lemonade premiered, Roy posted a photo on Instagram with the caption “Good hair don’t care, but we will take good lighting, for selfies, or self truths, always. live in the light #nodramaqueens.” The photo was quickly inundated with comments making heavy use of the bee 🐝 and lemon 🍋 emoji. Her Instagram account is now protected.
On Wikipedia this morning, Roy’s entry was subject to the now-predictable sort of vandalism that happens after a widespread and highly public dragging. Between 9:09 and 10:21 EDT, her page was edited, according to Wikipedia’s revision history, 182 times.
For brief moments, her name was altered to “Rachel Roach” or “Dusty Side Hoe that died under a lemonade stand.”
The page is now locked down, and cannot be edited until April 26. Everyone will probably have forgotten about the whole dustup by then.
During closing arguments, the plaintiff’s side leaned hard on the jury’s moral sensibilities, emphasizing the emotional distress that Hogan was caused by the tape’s release. Of Gawker, attorney Kenneth Turkel said, “They’re just not [decent], and they’re proud of it.” He also repeatedly emphasized that Gawker is based in New York City, not that there’s anything wrong with that.
Turkel’s main contention, however, was that Gawker had profited hugely off of the post, experiencing sustained and directly attributable rises in site traffic, leading to more ad revenue. Gawker disputes this, pointing out that no advertisements were displayed on the post itself, and that there’s no way to tell if the spike in traffic translated to real growth. And, as Gawker’s attorney later pointed out, the post actually experienced its greatest stretches of attention when Hogan himself called attention to it by filing his lawsuit.
Turkel then made a very weird request.
(Gentle reminder: Hulk Hogan is a professional-wrestling performer whose job hinges on his ability to convey feeling pain at will.)
Gawker, in its closing, laid out the case that Hogan had mostly followed the marketing playbook of other celebrities involved with sex tapes, appearing on “Howard Stern” and going through TMZ. “Who among us thinks it’s a good idea to send a serious message through TMZ?” attorney Michael Sullivan asked at one point.
Sullivan also leaned hard on the power dynamics at play here. While the plaintiffs emphasize Hogan as one man against a media machine, Sullivan cast the legal battle as one between a publication acting in the public interest and a celebrity using the courts to muzzle it. If the jury found for Hogan, Sullivan said, “celebrities will use our courts to punish people for saying things that they frankly do not like.”
After six hours of deliberation, a Florida jury awarded wrestler Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, $115 million in compensatory damages in his lawsuit against Gawker Media over a 2012 post that featured a 90-second excerpt from a sex tape Bollea had recorded with Heather Clem, the wife of his friend Bubba the Love Sponge. Gawker has long expected to lose the jury trial — Florida juries tend not to be hugely sympathetic to New York gossipmongers — but the enormous judgment represents a worst-case scenario, and the company will be required to post a $50 million bond as it appeals the verdict.
In its ruling — read as Hogan cried in the courtroom — the jury found that Gawker (and co-defendants Nick Denton, its founder, and A.J. Daulerio, its former editor-in-chief) intended to cause Hogan severe emotional distress (or acted with reckless disregard), that the company publicly disclosed private facts, and that Hogan had an expectation of privacy in the bedroom where the video was recorded. Of the $115 million, $55 million was awarded for economic damages, and $60 million for emotional distress.
In a statement, Denton expressed confidence that the verdict would be overturned on appeal. Nonetheless, the company will be put in an awkward financial position as the dispute makes its way through the appeals process. Earlier this year, it took on an investment from Columbus Nova Technology Partners — in part to hedge against exactly this possibility.
Denton’s probably right about the company’s chances. Before the verdict, the most dramatic part of Friday’s proceedings occurred after the jury had already gone off to deliberate, when the court unsealed documents that the jury was not privy to, many of which would likely have bolstered Gawker’s case against the pro wrestler.
Gawker had continually pointed out during the trial that testimony from Bubba the Love Sponge Clem, as well as other evidence, would support its claim that Hogan’s lawsuit was motivated by a desire to bury the tapes, which contained racist comments. Excerpts from the new documents would seem to support that claim.
Other documents show that Hogan claimed to know that he was being recorded, contradicting a key portion of Hogan’s team’s argument for seeking damages on invasion of privacy grounds.
All of this is to say that Keys certainly does not deserve two years in prison, and the CFAA needs serious reform. To put this in perspective, just a day prior to Keys’s sentencing, Ethan Couch — who killed four people in a drunk-driving accident in 2013 — was sentenced to two years in prison … for violating his parole.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has an entire section of its website devoted to advocating for CFAA reform. There are three main tenets: violating a website’s terms of use should not be the basis for a criminal complaint; commonplace circumvention techniques like changing one’s IP address should not be criminal; and, most importantly, the punishment should fit the crime.
The legislative process moves more slowly than the tech industry, and it always will, but lagging 30 years behind is not only ridiculous, it poses a danger to anyone who touches a computer.
Yesterday, former Reuters journalist Matthew Keys was sentenced to two years in prison. Keys had been convicted of assisting in hacking the Los Angeles Times website by providing usernames and passwords to members of Anonymous; he had the log-in credentials from having previously worked for a local TV station in California owned by Tribune Media, the same company that owns the L.A. Times.
Here is what the hackers did: They changed the headline on an article — “Pressure Builds in House to Pass Tax-Cut Package” became “Pressure Builds in House to Elect CHIPPY 1337” — as well as the sub-headline and byline. The change was live for 40 minutes. Keys himself did not make the alterations; a user in the chat room where he had posted the credentials did. (According to chat transcripts, he did encourage the cyber-vandalism.) CHIPPY 1337 was never identified or prosecuted.
This past October, Keys was found guilty on three counts of computer hacking under the archaic Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, following a trial in which Tribune had, in some instances, claimed nearly $1 million dollars in loss and damages. Keys continues to assert his innocence.
The exact loss and consequent damages caused by the hack has been in dispute throughout the legal proceedings. The alterations on the article were brief, and Tribune was never able to definitively prove that anyone actually saw them. It seems extremely unlikely that anyone cancelled a subscription because of the defacement, and even less likely that the Times’s credibility as a news organization was threatened. But, the prosecution argued, in the wake of the intrusion, the large media conglomerate did have to go through a comprehensive security audit and upgrade, which adds up to thousands of dollars in time and labor. Minor acts can have major cascading effects.
Still: A brief, minor defacement that led to money spent on beefed-up security doesn’t add up to two years in prison. If you’re wondering how the court reached that sentencing figure, this might help explain it: The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act — the federal law under which Keys was prosecuted — was enacted in 1986. That’s three decades ago, and seven years before the world wide web launched. Computers at the time were the property of corporations and those wealthy enough to afford them, not the widely accessible, fully networked tools they are today. (The CFAA is the same statute used to prosecute famed programmer Aaron Swartz, who committed suicide in 2013.)
The CFAA, among other provisions, makes it illegal to “[access] a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, [cause] damage and loss.” The language of the law is vague, to say the least. Humans authorize things by giving permission, and computers authorize actions by accepting log-in credentials.
That vagueness of “unauthorized access” has given prosecutors astronomically wide latitude in what can be prosecuted under the CFAA. If, for instance, you use your ex-boyfriend’s email address and password to log in to Netflix without his knowledge, you are potentially violating the law. It’s often invoked for things that aren’t really hacking in the contemporary sense, but can be defined as such under the CFAA, or in cases where no other charges will stick. As the podcast Reply All put it, prosecutors wield the CFAA in the same way that the tax code was used to convict Al Capone.
Before the sentencing, Keys posted on Medium, in part:
Finally, but most important, it’s potentially a way to make money. For commerce bots, for example, it’s not difficult to envision companies like Facebook or Microsoft taking a cut of transactions that occur over their chatbot platforms. Even if those companies can’t successfully insert themselves as middlemen in consumer deals, good and useful bots mean more time spent in a program by a user; more time means, eventually — fingers crossed — more money.
You might have already experienced a very rudimentary version of a bot by texting your bank to check your balance. Sending certain key words — BALANCE, HELP, UNSUBSCRIBE — to a number performs an action and, if necessary, returns requested information, without requiring the user to log in to a website or call up a teller. Siri, Apple’s iPhone personal assistant, is a kind of bot, as is Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa. Newer bots want a scenario where you can say something like, “How much did I spend at Chipotle in the past six months?” and get in response an exact (and possibly depressing) answer.
And this is now the Big Tech Thing for 2016?Yeah, pretty much. For tech companies, making this kind of conversational user interface, or UI (expect to see that term with increasing frequency), mainstream can lead to a lot of other interesting opportunities down the line.
Services like Kik and Facebook Messenger are weaving bots into their messaging services, so they can become a go-between for other companies and their customers. Facebook launched integration for third-party bots this week, so users can receive news from The Wall Street Journal or place an order with 1-800-Flowers.
Sephora, for example, has a bot for the chat app Kik that lets users chat with “the company” (really just a text-parsing program) about its products. Taco Bell, always quick to use new technology to sell its sins against meat, announced it’s been working on a bot for the work-chat app Slack that would let users order tacos with a simple text command.
Microsoft has its sights set on even loftier ambitions. It wants to make a bot framework that could be the tool set from which all chatbots are constructed, making bot creation available to people who possess limited coding experience or perhaps none at all. Should the shift to chatbots be as big as companies are predicting, Microsoft could have a huge first-mover advantage. If it can get people using its software to develop bots, it can probably start extracting revenue from the program at some point in the future.
Of course, so far all Microsoft has done is produce a “teen” bot that turned into an insane genocidal racist.
All these bots are for commerce?No. Some bots are for information or other small tasks, like a bot that texts you when it’s about to rain, or one that realizes you haven’t yet paid your rent this month and reminds you.
User convenience is a big selling point for bots. Rather than having to flip through separate apps and websites and UIs, a user can just, well, ask for something. And with AI growing more and more capable each day, the requests they can make can grow more and more complex as well.
That being said, bots will eventually have to make money, just like the Weather Channel, and it seems likely that some informational bots will be directly monetized in some way or another (like, at the most obvious end of the spectrum, ads sent in the midst of conversation).
If you’ve been paying attention to recent announcements from any of the major tech companies, then you’ve probably heard something about “bots.” Just yesterday, Facebook announced a new “bot platform” built on its messaging service, the idea being that its Messenger app can be more than just a device for chatting with friends. (Among other things, it can be the app you spend most of your time looking at on your phone, which would make Facebook happy.)
What does this mean for me?If you’re not already using some sort of messaging service now, you will be soon. Kik, Slack, Facebook Messenger, and Facebook subsidiary WhatsApp are all embracing bots. They could very well become, in a sense, the 2016 equivalent of AOL keywords — “schedule a test drive on Kik, username: Lexus.”
Wrap it up. Bore me with some good-ass tech talk.Another advantage for bots is that they operate server-side via the cloud. Your request gets beamed across the internet, where a server with much more processing power than your phone analyzes the data (text, photo, audio) received and generates a response. Rather than having to update an app, software changes are simply pushed to the server that you’re talking to, all without you having to do anything. If everything goes as planned, client-side software updates will appear less and less often.
It’s a funny new moment, watching Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon all seemingly agree with one another that “bots” are the future of tech — especially if you’ve spent any time trying to talk with the rudimentary bots of the past, like the AOL Instant Messenger bot SmarterChild or, God help us, Microsoft Office’s Clippy. But when the Frightful Five all align, it’s worth paying attention. What are bots? Why should you care? Am I a bot? Are you? Read on to find out!
What is a bot?Bots, as in, yes, robots, are automated programs that perform tasks for you automatically. You feed a bot an input — usually a question or an order — and, assuming it works, it’ll spit out a result or perform a function.
These days, people generally use bot to refer specifically to chatbots. A chatbot is exactly what it sounds like: a program that you control and interact with using language, by “chatting” with it rather than by clicking buttons and tapping icons. (Non-chatbots like Twitter bots can function to produce odd and enigmatic tweets automatically without any direct human input.)
In theory, bots are able to understand exactly what a user is trying to do, and help them along the way.
In reality, most bots have been like Clippy, the Dreamhaunter.
Clippy ruined my life. Why is Clippy back?Well, first of all, Clippy’s not back, despite what a recent Bloomberg cover story would have you believe. But the idea that animated Clippy (metaphorically speaking) is.
A program that can understand what users are doing (like “It looks like you’re writing a letter”) and predict what they want (maybe not like “Would you like some help?”) could be extremely useful, not to mention profitable to large tech companies. Conversational user interfaces are good for mobile, where limited screen space prevents programs from using large and complicated interfaces. At the same time, computing is finally reaching a state where it can mostly understand, process, and respond to human language, thanks to the fairly recent ability of companies to do that complicated work “server-side,” on networked computers that can handle much more demanding tasks than your phone.
(It’s worth noting that these tweets were sent in the middle of the night, the optimal time to fall down a YouTube k-hole.)
Social-media icon and director of the Hayden Planetarium Neil deGrasse Tyson has not yet responded to Tequila.
The main organization pushing the Flat Earth theory (which is a theory in the same way that gravity is a theory, a.k.a. fact) is the Flat Earth Society, founded in 1956 by a songwriter named Samuel Shenton (who died in 2001) and resurrected in 2004 by Daniel Shenton (apparently no relation).
Here’s what a flat earth looks like:
Flat Earthers also posit that the sun hovers above our flat earth and “acts like a spotlight and shines downward as it moves,” which explains the day-night cycle.
The theory has had a resurgence in recent months. In a petition on Change.org, the society wrote, “We ask Google to recognise this movement, which has trended over 600% in just the past 12 months, by marking 01/01/2016 as the anniversary of the Flat Earth Movement and changing the Google Doodle image appropriately.” (Their emphasis.)
It’s tough to gauge quite how serious individual Flat Earth believers are about the movement (this post, for example, is not serious). The Twitter account @FlatEarthToday is one of the more active accounts and claims to represent the Flat Earth Society at theflatearthsociety.org. Another account, @FlatEarthOrg, also claims to be the Flat Earth Society, located at tfes.org. Their account only consists of tweets to YouTube videos from conspiracy theorists, and retweets that clearly vary in seriousness, but their site contains a well-maintained explanatory wiki. The line between actually believing the theory and enthusiastically entertaining is unclear.
Being a Flat Earther exists in the same online space as chemtrails and the notion that 9/11 was an inside job: There are some who believe it sincerely, and magnitudes more who entertain the notion ironically. Conspiracy theories are very funny once you lean into them! Imagine finding out that a basic assumption about your life is completely wrong. It’s liberating, in a way. If nothing else, it gives you something to talk about.
What shape would you say Earth is? A sphere? Ha-ha, nice try. You could not be more wrong. Earth is a disc.
This is according to Tila Tequila, the model, porn star, Juggalette, erstwhile Nazi, and living monument to the ancient lost culture of MySpace.
“But,” you might stammer, “I was always taught that the earth was a sphere.” Oh, yeah? Who are you going to trust? The failing American public-education system or a two-hour documentary posted on YouTube by “Yoda’s Flat Earth Channel”?
The Flat Earth movement — by which I mean the evergreen alternate scientific/conspiracy theory that posits that the earth is a flat disc — has been around since the late 19th century. (A few ancient cultures did indeed assume the world was flat, though it was never as widely held a belief as some later historians would claim.) The first Flat Earthers, and most of their descendants, tended to push the theory as a confirmation of the Bible’s truth; early texts include The Inconsistency of Modern Astronomy and Its Opposition to the Scripture and the proto-listicle One Hundred Proofs That the Earth Is Not a Globe.
The evidence against the flat earth? Physics, photographs from space, the experience of watching a ship meet the horizon. Evidence for a flat earth? Well, you know, everything looks pretty flat. Allow Tila Tequila, the most “friended” person on Myspace v1.0, to explain:
There’s not much to say about this except that it’s fantastic and hugely enjoyable. There’s a cat and a hammock, and at first the cat is bad at getting into the hammock, but then he gets very good at climbing into the hammock. Good job, Timo! This is relatable to anyone who has ever messed up climbing into or out of a hammock (everyone).
It’s like, this is Monday …
And this is Friday …
Triumphant.
Now we’ve made it to the next phase of Garfield Antagonism. Atlas Obscura directs us to I Hate Jon Arbuckle, which concerns … well, you know what it’s about. Not content with letting Garfield be the Nermal of the real world, Jon has become the focus of relentless attacks and criticism. The extensive FAQ touches on everything from why Jon stinks to why his girlfriend, Liz, continues to stay in the picture to why the live-action film versions of Jon are also odious (or “Odie-ous”).
As for Garfield author Jim Davis, our blogger writes, “I think of him creating Jon Arbuckle the same way I think of other people creating evil characters. Just because the characters are evil doesn’t make the authors evil too. I do think it’s really nasty that he based such an awful character on himself though.”
Within the internet cartoon canon, the top-shelf characters are regarded with a distinct, clear irony. Shrek, Sonic the Hedgehog, the bee from Bee Movie — their dubious quality is regarded with a nostalgic fondness, even as they are ridiculed.
But there is one character for whom many feel no love at all, and that character is Garfield, the fat lasagna cat. People hate Garfield. Performative hatred of Garfield is a pervasive subculture online, and has been for many years.
As Something Awful tells it, the site’s users (“goons,” colloquially) “have a long history with Garfield, from getting in on the ground floor of the thought-bubble-removing craze back in 2006 to tossing all kinds of crap into the fat cat’s animated/non-animated mouth in 2007.”
One of the first popular Tumblr accounts was Garfield Minus Garfield, which edited the awful feline out of his own comic strip, leaving Jon Arbuckle alone in a pit of existential despair.
The Garfield hate train eventually moved to Twitter, where users still occasionally tweet insults at the cat.
Mortal leader of the Roman Catholic Church and pathological tech-lover Pope Francis is reportedly planning to join Instagram this Saturday, March 19 — just in time for Palm Sunday! The big news comes after he met with the app’s founder and chief executive officer Kevin Systrom back in February, and shouldn’t be too much of a surprise considering his very active Twitter presence.
But since the Vatican already has a very boring, verified Instagram account, I’ve put together some free pitches to help the pope spice up his feed. There are plenty of celebrity Instagrammers out there keeping things both PG and fun, and he could be one of them.
First order of business: He needs to Google Lisa Rinna from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and mock up some prayerful, Pinterest-ass inspirational graphics. Do you know how shareable those things are? I’m sure someone in the Vatican has access to Photoshop or MS Paint — he just needs to get them on the horn and have them queue up a fuckload of Psalms.
Few things on Instagram can compete with Oprah’s #HarvestDay posts, where she touts all the fresh veggies and weird-looking foods she grows in her garden by holding overflowing baskets of them up to her face. While I’m sure Francis isn’t running a vegan homestead inside the Vatican, that doesn’t mean he can’t improvise with some holier props. #NewCandleDay would be tight as hell. Feed us those piping-hot selfies.
The true gift of Martha Stewart’s personal Instagram account is that it’s so undeniably run by her and her alone. The Martha Stewart official account is where all the branded photos of inspirational Easter eggs go, but marthastewart48 is where she posts grainy, poorly lit photos of food and leaves a 30-typo description of what it was like running into Lionel Richie at a gala. Francis should treat this account the same way: Let the official Vatican worry about polish and shine, and serve us some true behind-the-scenes, humanizing shit in your personal grams.
Even though ham dog is doing well, it would not hurt to pray for ham dog anyway. 1 Like = 1 Ham = 1 Dog.
On December 23, Facebook user Stephen Roseman posted this photo:
“This poor dog,” the caption reads, “was badly burned and disfigured trying to save his family from a house fire.” The photo is, in case the headline was unclear, a dog with a slice of ham on his face. “One like = one prayer,” Roseman writes.
Ham dog is insanely viral. As of Wednesday afternoon, the dog and the ham have received 54,000 likes and more than twice as many shares, for a grand total of 1.1 million prayers. Some people are praying for ham dog, who they believe was scarred in a fire, when really, ham dog was only scarred by having to keep delicious ham on his face without eating it.
Could Chester be the furry community’s new daddy? So far, things are going … okay, as far as I can tell.
What a time to be alive.
Cereal mascot Tony the Tiger, who has an official Twitter account because that’s how public relations works now, has been beset of late by tweets from furries — fans of anthropomorphic animals who are hot for his anthropomorphic bod. Studly Tony, and the team of marketers behind him, realized they had accidentally beefed up a friendly character who sells Frosted Flakes to kids into a vessel for a very adult sexual fantasy. From a public image standpoint, not exactly grrr-eat.
So Tony took steps to quench the flames of furry passion, proactively finding and blocking furry accounts on Twitter, even ones who had never tweeted at him, on the off chance that they might direct horny tweets his way. This outraged the fur community, who referred to the corporate mascot’s mass blocking as a “purge.”
By Wednesday, the backlash was so strong that Tony had to issue this gentle rebuff to horny furries, sending the message that Kellogg’s might welcome their business, but it doesn’t welcome their muscly-anthropomorphic-feline fetishes.
Can you imagine how many people must have been involved in drafting, workshopping, rewriting, and signing off on this strategic tweet from a corporation controlling an animated tiger to fans who want to imagine that tiger having sex? Best. episode. of. Mad Men. ever.
The drama will blow over eventually, but in the meantime, another mascot and his corporate masters have sensed an opportunity. Chester Cheetah, the sunglasses-sporting Cheetos spokescat, is inclusive, thirsty for brand engagement, and open to experimentation.
The New York Times is reporting that Instagram will be the latest social network to introduce a feed that orders posts not in chronological order, but by using a sorting algorithm to show the most important content first, like great content from original creators like @fuckjerry and that guy you met at a party once who’s trying to get into "web" comedy. With this algorithmic timeline, “Instagram will place the photos and videos it thinks you will most want to see from the people you follow toward the top of your feed, regardless of the time those posts were originally shared.”
The service’s co-founder, Kevin Systrom, told the Times that the average user misses 70 percent of posts from people they follow, which is a complete waste of brunch photos. The new ordering system will be based on a combination of machine learning and collecting click signals from users. Given that the service is owned by Facebook, which went algorithmic in 2009, there’s probably a solid baseline.
Instagram will introduce the new feed “in a series of small tests with a single-digit percentage of user groups” before deciding whether to roll it out further. The company did not say whether users will be able to opt out, as they can with Twitter’s new algorithmic feed. Like every other time this happens, it will be annoying for two days and then you’ll be fine with it.
There’s no way you’ve avoided the news today: When an oddity as rare and beloved as David Bowie dies, it becomes the Only Story for a moment in internet time. And everyone has their own version of the Bowie story, a way that incredibly cool, queer, sideways, constantly changing man affected them personally. Illustrator Helen Green has been drawing hers over a period of years — you’ve no doubt seen it today in GIF form, an animated Bowie shifting through 29 distinct aesthetics and identities.
Green started drawing the individual pieces to celebrate Bowie’s birthday, and in early 2015 she put them together to form the famous animation that took on new meaning when Bowie died Sunday. Each portrait took around 35 hours, from pencil sketch to coloring in Photoshop. “Though,” Green said, “much of that time was spent finding references where David was facing in a specific direction.” David Bowie Weekend
Green created another portrait this year, when Bowie turned 69 and released his final album, Blackstar. She completed it less than a week before his death.
It’s hard to find the right words to mark Bowie’s passing, especially in a fleeting, constrained medium like Twitter, but it feels right to say something, and hundreds of people are finding that Green’s 29 portraits are worth thousands of words.
This raccoon just wanted to enjoy some cotton candy, but ended up mystified and bewildered instead.
You might think that this raccoon’s first mistake was putting the cotton candy in the water but you would be wrong. This raccoon’s first mistake was opting for cotton candy at all. That stuff’s not even filling. Cotton candy is made by clowns at carnivals for clowns at carnivals. End of debate.
An auspicious start to 2016 for this raccoon. Best of luck next year, in 362 days, chump.
Many people logging on to Facebook today have been greeted with a strange statistic: they’ve apparently known their friends for 46 years. “Friends on Facebook with Joe Schmo for 46 Years!” the service trumpets loudly, which is odd, because many of Facebook’s users are not 46 years old, and Facebook itself is certainly not 46 years old. Also not 46 years old: The web. Here’s what’s happening.
While you might be counting down to the New Year on Thursday night, computers everywhere will be celebrating a different — not better, just different — holiday: the 46th anniversary of the Unix epoch! If you ever received an email from December 31, 1969 — or been told by Facebook that you’re celebrating an anniversary from before its existence — you are familiar with the Unix epoch.
Basically, the Unix operating system — the basis of Mac OS X and used on servers around the globe — keeps time by counting up forever, in increments of one second, starting from zero — which is tied to January 1, 1970, at midnight Greenwich Mean Time. All dates are calculated relative to this one: The Unix epoch. January 2, 1970, at midnight, for instance, is 86,400 in Unix time, because there are that many seconds in a day.
When you receive phantom emails or notifications from 1969, it’s because there’s a bug in the way a computer — maybe yours, maybe your email providers, maybe Facebook’s — is calculating time. If the time has no value, or if the value has been reset, the computer assumes that it’s zero: midnight 1/1/1970 GMT. Once you roll that back for the United States, because GMT is five to eight hours ahead of the U.S., you land on December 31, 1969. This glitch is four and a half decades old.
Here is one idea for how to celebrate the anniversary of the Unix epoch: Explain all of this very loudly and aggressively at your New Year’s party.
Note: This post has been updated to include the extremely hilarious Facebook bug that popped up today.
After Taylor Swift famously removed all of her music from Spotify in November 2014, it was strange and shocking when one of her biggest hits, “I Knew You Were Trouble,” popped back up on the streaming service a few days ago. Even stranger to see it credited to the Welsh alt-rock band Lostprophets, best known for the single “Last Train Home” and for having a lead singer who’s currently serving time for child pornography.
As Gizmodo explains, the recording that appeared on Spotify wasn’t a cover song. It was definitely Taylor Swift’s “Trouble,” even though it was attributed to Lostprophets and listed former lead singer Ian Watkins as a copyright holder.
Gizmodo’s Adam Clark Estes investigated how the mislabeled song made it to Spotify in the first place, and traced it back to YouTuber Jared Brown, who “has a weird habit of uploading songs by one artist and attributing it to another.” Brown’s channel contains the audio of “I Knew You Were Trouble” with the same fake Lostprophets album cover that appeared on Spotify — the artwork is from a kids’ show called Scaredy Squirrel, for some reason. (And why Lostprophets? Taylor Swift may have theoretically “lost profits” when she shunned Spotify, but she’s doing okay.)
Brown’s video doesn’t explain how the song ended up back on Spotify, though. It only has 1,000 views, and it’s not as if some unknown YouTuber can upload songs directly — there’s a screening process, and this track somehow slipped through it.
A Spotify spokesperson gave Estes an explanation via email, albeit an incomplete one: The track came from a “third party provider,” who’s now in big trouble for apparently manipulating the system.
Is this a weird accident caused by some failed algorithm, or is someone — perhaps Jared Brown? — a brilliant intentional troll? No one seems to know, but either explanation makes for an amusing commentary on the gatekeepers who control access to major music-distribution platforms, be they human or software.
If you feel like doing a more in-depth security audit, you can check and make sure the malware file, General.rtf, is no longer in Transmission by right-clicking the app and choosing “show package contents.” Then drill down from "Contents" to "Resources" and ensure the file is absent.
An infected copy will contain the file, but a clean one will not.
There is no Mac-user boast more smug than "Macs don’t get viruses" — and none that’s less true, either. On Sunday, another piece of evidence emerged indicating that malware creators are placing some of their attention on OS X. Security researchers at Palo Alto Networks announced yesterday that Transmission, a popular BitTorrent client, has been infected with ransomware.
Ransomware is an increasingly popular type of malware that holds a computer hostage by encrypting all of its data. Then, owners must pay a ransom (usually in untraceable Bitcoin) to have their computer unlocked again. These attacks usually target individual systems but not always. Last month, a ransomware attack on a hospital cost the facility $17,000.
First things first: If you haven’t downloaded a recent copy of Transmission, you almost certainly don’t have the malware, called KeRanger. Still, if you want to check, the easiest way is to open up Activity Monitor — located in your Utilities folder — and ensure that a process called “kernel_service” is not running (“kernel_task” is an entirely different operation).
Here’s the virus in action:
Precisely how KeRanger got into Transmission is unclear, though the leading theory is that the program’s official website was compromised, and the regular download copy was switched out for an infected version. Transmission is an open-source project, so its source code is publicly accessible and manipulable — Transmission’s status as leading BitTorrent (read: piracy) software is not directly related to this attack. (One might intuit, however, that people who pirate media and software might be less concerned with their computer’s security, making them more susceptible to malware intrusions.)
The source was authenticated with a valid Mac development certificate, so OS X’s Gatekeeper security feature did not throw up any red flags. The certificate has since been revoked by Apple, so the infected software can’t be installed. The most recent version released over the weekend is malware-free.
That said, if you’re running Transmission, it’s worth checking to see what version. Version 2.90 is the infected version, while the most recent, 2.92, is clear (2.91 was not infected but did not automatically remove the file containing the malware).
A few weeks ago, the relatively small crowd of mentally unstable media professionals who spend all day looking at Twitter received some alarming news: Twitter was going to raise its iconic 140-character limit. The new limit, 10,000 characters, would be more than enough for even the most verbose of the commentariat.
Friday morning, CEO Jack Dorsey told the Today show that Twitter was not eliminating or raising the character limit. “It’s staying,” he declared. “It’s a good constraint for us, and it allows for ‘of the moment.’”
Sure, okay, everyone can rest easy, I guess? Except that this changes nothing.
Here was the not-quite-confirmed idea, according to Recode in January:
Basically, tweets larger than 140 characters would seem to function in the same way that multimedia does on the service currently. Users click to expand the content. There was never going to be a point where Twitter would throw an unabridged, overlong personal essay in your face. Expanded text would function in the same way that richer content like photos and videos and polls do now; 10,000-character tweets were not going to change the look of your general Twitter feed more than any other type of attachment.
Which is to say that Dorsey’s statement on NBC this morning means nothing. Twitter can still technically keep its 140-character limit and still allow users to write lengthy posts. That was always the plan.
“For a minute, I thought of deleting the page,” Foran told the Beast. “Now I think I can’t do that.”
Since then, he’s embraced the party and given up on loneliness.
“Its been one week since I posted this event and the response I’ve gotten is incredible,” he wrote on Facebook, “… I know I’ve said many times that this is a solo event, but I truly look forward to meet you all on new year’s eve.”
Nothing brings people together like crying alone. And bread.
An Ontario college student who just wanted to spend his New Year’s Eve alone, eating bread and crying, inadvertently inspired tens of thousands of people to say they’re doing the same.
Sam Foran’s Facebook event, “Crying and Eating Bread by Yourself on the Floor,” started as a joke, he told the Daily Beast. His roommate had introduced him to the weird Facebook subculture of “random” pages and events, e.g. “Dropping Out of School to Become a Potato”—and he wanted to try making his own. So, one sleepless night, he did.
“Crying and Eating Bread by Yourself on the Floor” is still a joke, but now it’s a joke with around 35,000 people RSVPing yes and another 40,000 or so “interested.”
It’s not clear how so many people discovered the event, because Foran says he didn’t invite anyone — that was part of the joke.
“I like crying. I like eating bread. I like being by myself. I like lying on the floor. I thought I would combine all four into one epic night of self pity and regret. Tissues and light refreshments will be provided,” Foran wrote in the event description.
But the Daily Beast speculates that Foran’s event was the lucky beneficiary of a Facebook algorithm, and now he’s not alone at all.
At least in spirit. Foran said he’d talked with his roommate about turning the event into an actual party, but right now he’s still planning on a solo evening of tears and baked goods on the floor, because it would be funny.
He’s also talked to sponsors in an attempt to turn the sudden popularity of bread and crying into something useful, perhaps for charity, but has so far come up empty-handed (call him, Kleenex and Wonder Bread!).
An analysis of the next year of “Come to Brazil” mentions on Twitter (as well as its alternative Brasil spelling) shows a slow and steady rise in frequency, imploring acts like Madonna and Blink-182 to visit the country.
Up until mid-2009, one could search through the appearances of “Come to Brazil” in any given month with relative ease. But around June 2009, usage suddenly picks up a lot of steam. The summer of 2009, in particular, was a tipping point for Twitter. Protests had erupted in Iran contesting the results of recent presidential elections; the so-called Green Movement was described by The Atlantic as “the first major world event broadcast worldwide almost entirely via social media.”
Also, in March, a young upstart pop singer named Justin Bieber joined the service.
It might seem long ago, but nearly a decade ago, Bieber was a wholesome Canadian crooner plucked straight from YouTube by Usher himself. Bieber’s real genius was his casual and frequent use of social media — a connection that gave his millions of fans the genuine sense that they could talk to him via the internet. Bieber made Twitter, as much as any one person not directly employed by the company can be said to have: In 2010, a Twitter employee claimed that 3 percent of the platform’s servers were dedicated to Bieber at any given moment.
Bieber sent his first tweet in May. It would be patently ridiculous for me to equate the Green Movement with Bieber fans tweeting “Come to Brazil,” but it would not be out of line to say that the movement helped cement Twitter’s reputation as an effective tool for organizing young people, demanding attention from elites, and communicating across vast distances.
On June 16, 2009, Justin Bieber got the call: “Come to Brazil.”
The ritual of call and response is an ancient and almost instinctive behavior. It’s no accident that it shows up as a form in observances that extend far back beyond modern technology: religion, music, athletic events, even greeting. “Dominus vobiscum.” “Et cum spiritu tuo.” “As-salaam alaikum.” “Wa-alaikum as-salaam.” “Thank you @JLo for having me at opening night. Incredible show. Thanks and congrats.” “Come to Brazil."
Somewhere along the way, Brazil’s thirst for celebrity attention caught the attention of non-Brazilian social media users. The celebrity gossip blog Oh No They Didn’t has a tag devoted to the topic of celebrities visiting the country, and Tumblr users picked up on the fervency of Brazilian fandom.
The desperation of Brazilian pop-culture fans is so acute, according to Lucas Armiliato, a student and graphic designer, that fans will basically settle for anything. “In my opinion, part of the ‘Come to Brazil’ ‘phenomenon’ started because we’ll literally like anyone that comes here. … I mean, the media even covered Sharon Stone’s visit.”
Moara Juliana, a São Paulo resident and layout designer at a small publisher, explained to me that the rise of “Come to Brazil” stems from the simple fact that celebrities don’t often visit the country. “This ‘please come to Brazil’ thing is usually said (unironically) by teens trying to get their fave artists to come here,” she said. “We are heavy consumers of foreign (specifically American) culture: tv shows, bands, etc. And we expect these people to come here so we can see and meet them … BUT! They take too long to come! My mom (who is 55) waited like 20 years to see U2 and Paul McCartney, her favorite music.”
Plus, as Dani pointed out, “it’s hard for some people in Brazil go to the USA or London or Canada, etc.” She added that there is a slight sense that Americans, simply by living in the same cities as celebrities, have a greater chance of interacting with them. “We don’t have this chance to meet our idol in the streets, so sending tweets, it’s like our way to be noticed.”
The thing is that “Come to Brazil” does actually work. In July of 2014, Ariana Grande posted this message.
“Come to Brazil”: Look in the replies to any tweet or video from any pop star or teen idol, and you will see the most recognizable phrase on celebrity internet. “Come to Brazil”: Three simple words that have embedded themselves deep in the heart of the internet’s fandom culture as the automatic, immediate response to anything published by certain celebrities. “Come to Brazil”: The last inevitability in a disrupted world.
Juliana said that some celebrities do get the message. “Misha Collins from Supernatural, he saw he has a lot fans here, started making posts to Brazilian fans, posting in Portuguese and everything, and every now and then he comes here.”
Dani was similarly excited that the tactic brought her idols to the country. Selena Gomez and the aforementioned Misha Collins visited Brazil, as have Vine stars like Jack and Jack and Taylor Caniff. When Caniff visited, she said, “I couldn’t see them but i was really happy bc THEY WERE IN MY COUNTRY hahaha.”
Dani said that it definitely seemed like more celebrities were passing through Brazil than was the case five years ago. For Brazilian fans, all of that hard work does eventually pay off.
“Come to Brazil” is popular and well-known enough to be a widely used punch line — but its regularity also has the odd effect of occluding it, turning it from a semantically meaningful phrase into a kind of shibboleth. It’s probably worth starting off by saying what “Come to Brazil” is not. It is not a code word. There is no hidden meaning behind “Come to Brazil.” It is a command or a request. “Come to Brazil” literally means “Come to Brazil."
Dani, a Brazilian Twitter user who regularly asks celebrities (now mostly Vine stars) to come to Brazil, put it to me simply: “Brazilians fans do that because we want our idols in Brazil.”
The origins of the phrase are easy enough to trace. The very first time “Come to Brazil” was posted on Twitter was April 2008, when user @cecilab invited Loic Le Meur, head of defunct app Seesmic, to the South American country.
LeMeur, not quite the pop-star type who would soon be on the receiving end of the refrain, did not respond.
(Twitter, of course, is the easiest place to track “Come to Brazil” usage. The request is prevalent on YouTube and Facebook as well, but its path is less easily traced. Facebook’s kludgy sliding scale of public-private makes tracking the phrase difficult. The murky swamp of comments that exists below every YouTube video offers a similar conundrum. To be clear, “Come to Brazil” is popular on those websites as well. I briefly thought about diving into Orkut, Google’s early attempt at a social network, before realizing that it was only popular in Brazil, thus making it useless for communicating with celebs.)
The use of “trolling” to describe politicians’ poll-tested Snapchats is so asinine and depressing that I won’t dignify it here. It is not trolling; it is politics. (The one politician who might be able to make an honest claim to old-school, u-mad-bro? trolling — rather than just basic electoral gamesmanship — is Donald Trump. And, of course, his “trolling” has horrifying real-world consequences.)
What these kinds of trolling — harassment, contrarianism, and political jousting — really have in common isn’t a particular activity but a general pattern of attention-seeking behavior. The troll is an attention seeker, sure, but so is everyone else online; it’s the web’s chief currency — measured by page view, video play, or engagement minute — and people will do whatever they can to attain it. Describing any kind of attention-seeking as “trolling” means that 90 percent of online activity is trolling. And maybe you believe that! But you’re rendering equivalent the asinine and abusive — and excusing all of it under the guise of “fun and games.”
So if those are poor uses of the word, what is true trolling? To reclaim the term, to make it meaningful and useful again, we must focus on good, righteous trolling. Trolling that requires some thought, work, and artfulness, and doesn’t actually harm anyone. Trolling that takes the absurdities of media economies, social interaction, and political theater, and renders them bare. Trolling that is, dare I say, actually funny.
There may not be a better example of noble trolling than online comedian Virgil Texas’s invasion of a Confederate-flag Facebook group earlier this year. By somehow convincing the group’s owner to make him an admin, Virgil took control of a pro-Confederate-flag group, which claimed to be about “heritage, not hate,” but also, unsurprisingly, featured posts calling on people to “take our land back from the mongros.” He added many of his friends (full disclosure: including me), who flooded the group with ridiculous memes and gross images. (I can’t say I endorse everything that was posted, but most of it was wonderful.) Virgil and his friends repeatedly changed the name of the group, from “Confederate Pride, Heritage Not Hate” to, for example, “LGBT Southerners for Michelle Obama and Judaism,” “I’m Gay,” and “Islam Is the Light.” The group’s members were baffled and enraged to suddenly be in a “libtard” group.
Better even than taking on random racists is trolling that takes on well-known, influential people, like politicians or otherwise prominent morons. Richard Dawkins, the famous meme scientist, has unfortunately revealed himself as a bigot with tweets like, “All the world’s Muslims have fewer Nobel Prizes than Trinity College, Cambridge.” His trolls responded by spreading memes of deeply earnest but entirely fake quotes from Dawkins: This masterpiece of the genre has Dawkins saying that if everyone in China jumped up in the air at once, the Earth would “break in half.” Or there was the time that Representative Darrel Issa, who voted for the Iraq war, asked Twitter to honor Veterans Day with pictures of their military family members, and was duped into retweeting pictures of Heinrich Himmler and Timothy McVeigh.
Not all good trolling has to be directed at conservatives or bigots, of course: It can be just as noble to troll liberals, particularly the most earnest, self-satisfied types. John Fugelsang, who’s made a career out liberal dad jokes, attracts plenty of trolling for his love of quoting himself in bad, bad memes. As with Dawkins, the fake quote is a powerful tool, and his obsession with Jesus being a liberal is particularly fruitful. The abusive tactics of the 4chan mob are well-documented, but when they put their minds to it, they can be inventive in a harmless, puerile way. Earlier this year, they successfully launched a “feminist” hashtag campaign to end Father’s Day — though ultimately they seem to have mostly fooled conservative websites into covering the campaign as though it were real.
Trolling doesn’t have to be about politics or anything at all, though. It can be as pure and lovely as Jon Hendren’s accidental appearance on HLN, where he answered questions about Edward Snowden as if they were about Edward Scissorhands, earnestly condemning ostracizing Snowden “simply because he has scissors for hands.” (HLN had actually meant to book Al Jazeera journalist John Hendren, who was very cool about it.) This sort of absurdist trolling harms no one, other than making the host look a bit foolish. It mocked 24-hour-cable-news culture, but ultimately its only purpose was the joy of a man on TV talking about Edward Snowden’s scissor hands with a straight face.
And that’s the beauty of trolling: seeing something earnest decay into absurdity. That’s what makes it so joyful to see Richard Dawkins diligently informing people that he did not say “stick your finger up the hole, out pops a tootsie roll,” and it’s even better when it takes on those with real power. Random insults at politicians aren’t valuable, but getting them to trip over their own egos is truly a public service. At their best, these good-trolling, “emperor has no clothes” moments don’t just reveal the egocentrism and narcissism of politicians and celebrities — they reveal the emptiness at the center of the attention economy, by driving huge volumes of viewers and visitors to gape at the absurd and nonsensical. They also make me, and many others, laugh very hard.
Abuse and harassment on the internet can ruin, or end, lives. It’s wrong to minimize that behavior by calling it the same thing we call dumb articles from political journalists. And it undermines the good work that the best trolls do in making the powerful look foolish, or just in making us laugh. The world is shitty, and the internet especially so. Thank god for the small joy of making bad people look dumb.
Reading news online, you could be forgiven for thinking that trolling is a synonym for “doing something on the internet.” Gamergaters are “trolling” women. Edward Snowden is “trolling” the NSA. President Obama is “trolling” Republicans — with a “hilarious ‘grumpy cat’ meme,” no less. You don’t even need to be online to troll: The Walking Dead is, apparently, “trolling” its audience.
People have argued about the real meaning of trolling for years, but it’s clear that it’s expanded even beyond its already over-broad, generally accepted definition of “provoking an outsized reaction.” The new idea of “trolling” is, essentially, provoking any kind of reaction, anywhere. It’s part and parcel of an internet culture where attention is equated with quality, and where harassment is greeted with the same jaded response as dumb jokes on forums. Did you make a joke in a comment section? You’ve trolled it. Did you obliquely insult a political opponent? You’ve trolled him. Did you harass a woman to the point of police action? You trolled her. Are you Donald Trump? You’re trolling the entire world.
It’s not just nonsensical for a single word to refer to everything from sexual harassers and purveyors of racial hatred to mildly amusing jabs from the president, it’s stupid. And it’s time to take trolling back.
Endless etymologies of the word have been written, but at its most basic, trolling means intentionally disrupting something. Initially, that something was online communities like Usenet; now, that “disruption” includes organized campaigns of online abuse, which can lead to suicide. While 4chan isn’t exclusively dedicated to harassment — it’s the site that brought us Rickrolling and lolcats, too — the site’s users are behind many abusive online campaigns. Jezebel writer Anna Merlan was sent rape threats by 4chan users after describing the site as “the Internet’s home for barely potty-trained trolls.”
This kind of “trolling” is the kind shock local news reports and academics are most interested in. A 2014 study found internet comment trolls were “prototypical everyday sadists,” strongly exhibiting characteristics of narcissism and psychopathy. As the New York Times put it in a 2008 article on 4chan’s harassment of the family of a teenager who committed suicide, “Trolling has evolved from ironic solo skit to vicious group hunt.”
But calling this behavior “trolling” minimizes its real-world effects. It’s targeted harassment that seeks to create genuine misery. It is abuse, it is dangerous, and it is revolting. As Anita Sarkeesian has said of Gamergate, trolling is too “childish” a term — it makes it sound like a fun game.
At the other end of the spectrum is the use of the term by journalists to describe over-the-top attention-getting articles. Think Vox’s arguments that meat eaters are worse than Cecil the Lion’s killer or that the American Revolution was a mistake. Last week, Sonny Bunch of the neoconservative Washington Free Beacon drew ire for a desperately lame Washington Post piece arguing that the destruction of Alderaan in Star Wars was “completely justified.” As Vox’s Dylan Matthews put it, the piece was “a barely disguised argument for nuking Iraq in 2003.”
Articles like this are trolling as much as a toddler who pours his cereal on the floor is trolling: You’ve disrupted something, sure, but it’s hardly an achievement. It’s not difficult to piss people off arguing that nukes are good, because yes, it is bad to nuke people. Shockingly, saying something dumb will cause people to say that you are dumb.
The main giveaway is that the small penguin in this picture, Tuxie, is female. The above image is likely a very good ROM hack or Photoshop. Regardless, the Sons have migrated over to Twitter, where they are taking the meme-o-sphere by storm.
On Tumblr, as is usually the case, it’s gotten weirder.
The next time you see a son, show them this meme! Sons love it.
Sons: We all know them. If you’re not a son yourself, you’ve probably met one or two. Fun fact: Sons represent roughly half of the global population. Wow, that’s a lot!
On popular social-media platforms, sons are more popular than ever, but not for the reason you might think. (Actually, I don’t know the reason you might think.) Sons are burning up social media because people are posting photographs with the caption “Don’t talk to me or my son ever again.” Weird, right?
It’s actually not that complicated. See, what you do is you take a thing, and pair it with a smaller, identical version of that thing, and then caption it … you guessed it: “Don’t talk to me or my son ever again.”
Where did this enthralling meme come from? The best guess, according to Know Your Meme, is that the Son meme comes from this old Tumblr post about Cowboy Bebop from a few months ago.
Some are now claiming, based on a separate Tumblr post, that the meme actually comes from Super Mario 64, but this is false.

The Force Awakens hit theaters only a week ago, and if you have even passing knowledge of the internet you won’t be surprised to hear that hundreds of authors and illustrators in the fan-fiction community are already hard at work asking tough questions, like, “Yo, what if these two (or three) characters kissed?” But in a Star Wars universe with at least four major new roles, the key question is: Who are we most excited to read about boning? (Shockingly underrepresented: BB-8.)
This is the obvious, but no less exciting, pair. From “You Are Stellar“:
Kylo Ren–Rey (73 stories)
Also known as “Reylo.” Nothing gets a devoted fanfiction community going like the frisson of possible incest. From “That Which Lies Beneath”:
Poe-Finn (103 stories)
The undeniable, undisputed ship champion. From “Late Nights”:
Since the dawn of Kirk-Spock slashfic (slash being, the more cultured among you already know, the genre of fan fiction focused on queer sexual and romantic relationships), no higher praise has been available to science fiction than an army of devoted fans eagerly imagining characters falling in love, engaging in cute domestic tasks, and screwing each other’s brains out.
The Force Awakens is no exception. The movie might seem to be setting up a relationship between beautiful scavenger Rey and handsome ex-conscript Finn. But maybe you thought Finn and the dashing pilot Poe Dameron shared a moment in the TIE fighter? Or possibly you felt like it was more than just workplace tension simmering underneath the arguments between masked sith Kylo Ren and galactic fascist General Hux? Why stop there? Wouldn’t Rey, Finn, and Poe make for a beautiful nontraditional Jedi wedding?
The question, of course, is which of these many possibilities is setting the internet’s pants on fire. Lucky for our scientific inquiry, the major fan-fiction site Archive of Our Own categorizes its submissions by coupling, allowing us to create the Official Force Awakens Shipping Power Rankings, from least-shipped to most.

It’s a new generation of characters, and the old ones are less fun to write about. From “Hope Is the Only Thing I Have Left”:
There are functions that many people agree a smartwatch should perform. This includes checking email and text messages, tracking your heart rate and other health indicators, maybe taking dictation.
The U8, an extremely cheap smartwatch that often appears on eBay, offers a new feature: sending something to China. When users paired the smart device with an Android companion app, security researchers found that it was communicating with an unknown IP address. “We ran dynamic and behavioural analysis (on the pairing app) and discovered that when it was paired, it started communicating outbound over a random IP address to China,” researcher Michael Raggo told the BSides SF security conference.
Even if you weren’t the sort of person to log the IP addresses your devices connect to, the average person might have noticed something was amiss. Watch owners downloaded the companion app “from an IP address scrawled on a piece of paper that comes with the U8 watch.” Android, unlike iOS, allows its users to install software from sources other than its first-party app store.
Exactly what the purpose of the Chinese IP address was remains unclear. In general, though, if you care about the security of your devices, you might get some peace of mind by picking up a smartwatch that doesn’t sell for $17 on eBay.
Anthony Cumia, the lowbrow radio personality who left “The Opie and Anthony Show” earlier this year after making “racially charged and hate-filled remarks” on Twitter, was arrested Saturday on charges of domestic violence. This time, a different social media app sealed his fate: His accuser livestreamed the apparent assault on Periscope.
Then she turned the camera on Cumia, who played the whole thing off like it was a comedy bit as she backed away and yelled at him to stop coming toward her.
Cumia does not exactly have a reputation as a nice person with good impulse control. He spent hours tweeting racist obscenities about a woman who allegedly assaulted him while he was taking photos on the street. He also wished physical violence on the woman, saying he hoped she died, and that she was lucky he didn’t use the gun he had on him. After the incident with Dani Golightly Saturday, he was charged with “strangulation, criminal mischief, unlawful imprisonment and assault.” He pleaded not guilty, according to TMZ, and his lawyer said in a statement that “things are not always what they appear to be and this is a perfect example of that."
Cumia’s alleged victim, a 26-year-old woman who goes by Dani Golightly, is the daughter of comedian and New Jersey comedy-club proprietor Vinnie Brand, Gawker reported. She’s also Cumia’s girlfriend — or was, before this incident — according to the New York Post. Cumia and Golightly have known one another since at least 2008, when she made an appearance on “Opie and Anthony.”
“That’s Vinnie’s daughter?” one of the hosts asked, “Why would he let her come here today?”
Guest Louis C.K. suggested that everyone was being nice, “but what’s hanging in the air is that everybody wants to fuck her tits into oblivion.”
“I’m sorry,” he said, after a round of applause. “It’s ‘The Opie and Anthony Show.’ What can I do?”
Seven years and change after her appearance at everyone’s favorite juvenile on-air frat party, Dani Golightly was all grown up and streaming on Periscope from Long Island, where she said Cumia had just broken her hand and bruised her.
“I’m waiting for police to come,” she said in the video. “I tried to call the police, but he turned the phone off.”
“Could you leave my house?” a man, allegedly Cumia, could be heard asking in the background. “I’m asking. I’ll pay to have you go back to New York.”
You would think, in general, Donald Trump’s supporters would not be the most gay-friendly. So have you had any negative reactions from Trump’s incredibly angry supporters?I’ve had a few tweets that are like, “I’m glad I’m not gay” or whatever, a little derogatory, but a lot of the Trump supporters have been positive and were almost welcoming. I think there is something to say that the supporters of Trump are probably not as bigoted as Trump is. There hasn’t actually been a harsh backlash. A lot of people understand that it’s a joke and satire and that it’s supposed to be funny. Some think it’s real, and are really angry at me and don’t understand how the internet works. For the most part, people are just having fun with it.
Of the people getting upset at the account, what is their main criticism?It’s mostly that Donald Trump is not the most gay-friendly candidate, and that has elicited a negative response from them. They probably can’t believe that, like, “Oh, he has the twinks supporting him now — what group isn’t supporting him?”
So these are people who dislike Donald Trump and are upset at the idea of gay people supporting him.Yeah, that’s definitely a large faction of people that are following and interacting with the account. It’s definitely been more liberal criticism than conservative criticism, I would say. But this is not a large amount of criticism. Most people understand the joke. What’s most intriguing to me are people who are actually gay GOP members who are following the account and having a good laugh with it.
Where are you sourcing the pictures from?Just Google Images.
Are you just Googling, like, “Twink”?Yeah, I Google “Twink” and then a lot of porn comes up, so I have to put SafeSearch on. That’s been interesting. I can’t really pull my phone out and Google that in public.
Do you have an end goal with the account?It’s bringing a level of absurdity to the election that can match Donald Trump’s absurdity, and having fun with it. I’m not naïve, I know that this election will have a lot of consequences for a lot of people, and some of those won’t be so good depending on who wins, but I think that we shouldn’t lose our ability to have fun and to laugh at it.
Donald Trump interacts with almost anyone who tweets at him. If he does interact with you because you’re tweeting positive things and he has an ego, is that a goal? Oh, for sure. That’s been one of my main goals. Of the characteristics the account has taken on, No. 1 is that Trump is “daddy.” So he gets at least ten to 12 tweets from the account, responding to his tweets, letting him know that he’s daddy because we want Donald Trump to know that. That’s been a goal. I think it’d be hilarious if he actually retweeted it and thought he had the support of twinks, which in reality is maybe five people in the U.S. or something. I don’t know if he’s dumb enough to do that, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he is dumb enough to do it.
What happens to the account if Trump doesn’t win?I’m kinda just playing it by ear. I don’t have a lot of long-term plans, but if he’s not the nominee, I think it’d also be hilarious if it continued to troll him for the rest of his life.
Currently the only thing on Twitter doing anything to shake this awful funk we’re in because of this horrible cartoon campaign season is @TwinksForTrump, a real-life manifestation of the Gay Agenda that wants to let Trump and everyone else know that Trump is #daddy. (For the most straight readers out there, a twink is a young, skinny gay man.)
What do you think of the Bottom for Hillary campaign? It’s a much more … earnest take on gay men and politics.I think it’s hilarious and does have a very earnest goal. My goal is not earnest at all.
It’s just trolling, at the heart of it.Yeah, I would like to get that across. Like, how can you troll the master troll? That’s one of the goals of the account.
Who are you supporting in the election?I haven’t decided! I’m gonna support the Democratic nominee, whoever that is, but I do need to decide who I’m gonna caucus for. I’ve also seen a hashtag called Bottoms for Bernie. I don’t think it has many followers. But if any members of Bottom for Hillary or Bottoms for Bernie want to convince the Twinks for Trump founder who he should caucus for, then they’re free to do that.
So it’s an unequivocally bad thing if Donald Trump is elected. But is it a good thing for Twinks for Trump?It would be a good thing, theoretically, for the character. It would be a bad thing for me because I don’t want to be doing this for four years, and it would probably go to a dark place, because I don’t think a Trump presidency is going to be a funny or good thing. Hopefully he doesn’t win.
Do you think Donald Trump knows what a twink is?He’s from New York, I’m sure he’s seen a twink or two.
Is the Twinks for Trump brand expanding?I’m making shirts! Maybe a hat. Kind of to see how this is going to evolve. I’m just playing it by ear, in the same way Donald Trump seems to be playing his campaign by ear, making up shit as he goes.This interview has been edited and condensed.
Cody Permenter, a 24-year-old who works in social media in Seattle, started the account less than a week ago and has already accrued over 3,000 followers.
Can you tell me when you first thought of creating the account?Really the idea behind this account started with a video CNN did a while back. They had these three bros who were Trump supporters, and they were trying to talk about how younger people were supporting Trump, and painting it into this “movement.” I thought those interviews were absolutely hilarious, and I just made a comment to my friend, “What is up with these twinks nowadays? What are these twinks for Trump doing?” And then I was like, “Oh, Twinks for Trump. That sounds kinetically pleasing and could be hilarious.” I was wondering if there are actually gay people who support Donald Trump. That’s kind of how the whole idea came around. [Ed. note: the account’s bio picture is of Tate Moyer, the most twinkish of CNN’s Trump bros.]
Do you self-identify as a twink?No, I’m definitely not a twink, which is also why I think it’s hilarious. I am a gay man, but I’m definitely more of a cub or a bear. Also hilarious to me is the idea that this large gay man could run a Twinks for Trump account. A point that the Twitter account’s trying to make is how absurd Donald Trump’s campaign is, and to match it with an equal amount of absurdity.
The account seems to have amassed a following really quickly.I honestly have no idea how it took off. I think people just recognize how ridiculous the concept is, and I think that as the 2016 election unfolds, it’s becoming more and more serious, and people just needed a chance to laugh about it and bring a little bit of humor back into it.
Have actual gay supporters of Donald Trump interacted with the account?I’ve had several accounts follow it that are like, “bromo,” which is a homo bro, I guess. They were tweeting in support. I’ve had a wide variety of people interacting with this. The most intriguing to me are these individuals from the LGBT community who actually support Donald Trump and think he would actually be the best president. They’re kind of interesting.
Some are leaving the school.
Some are mad at the media. (Hi!)
Some are stoked that class got cancelled.
Some are trying to bring everyone together with that dank kush.
Some have missed the point.
Some are unfamiliar with the flawed doctrine of “separate but equal.”
Some lack self-awareness.
Some would like John Cena to weigh in on the matter.
In the end, though, many of the students are just your regular college kids, singularly focused on one thing.
Following the news that University of Missouri president Tim Wolfe would resign following pressure and a boycott from students, the campus’s Yik Yak — the anonymous, up-voting, location-based messaging app and the hell we deserve in 2015 — has devolved into a lot of complaining and not-quite-outwardly racist statements from student in the vicinity.
To properly calibrate your reaction to Yik Yak, it’s important to recognize that its basic proposition is "what if there was a comments section all the time, everywhere, attached to nothing in particular." As the last 20 years of internet have demonstrated, the people most eager to comment anonymously, and most dedicated to the craft, tend to be the most toxic and useless. Yik Yak, whose incentive structure has a kind of built-in feedback loop — it’s known for outrageous and offensive statements; people visit it to make and read outrageous and offensive statements; those outrageous and offensive statements are voted into prominence; which means that it’s known for outrageous and offensive statements — is not an app to load if you want see the best of what our college students have to offer.
But it is a good app for seeing what college students think lots of people believe, but are afraid to say out loud. And at Mizzou, that means a lot of banal, self-interested racism and willful ignorance.
Some users are saying that the incident has only caused them to become more racist.
Either way, the original video and its imitators connected with people who love cats, and probably also people who hate cats. An entire community was soon formed on Reddit devoted to these videos; it now has more than 20,000 subscribers. The Daily Mail attempted to launch a backlash, railing against, to quote the URL, “appalling-videos-showing-pet-s-terrified-reactions-CUCUMBERS.html.”
As it turned out, the Daily Mail was too early. Last week, the internet — obeying its laws of eternal recurrence — resurfaced another video. Now that cucumbers scaring cats has caught on, the initial amusement has worn off and serious meme journalists have started to go negative. Gizmodo entreated cat owners last week to “resist the overwhelming urge” to spook their pets with vegetables. NPR did an entire segment.
And now the meme has finally reached its logical conclusion on Monday, when the Daily Mail covered this cat acting completely indifferent to a cucumber:
Same, kitty. Same.
This summer, a popular YouTube video introduced the world to the strange fact that most cats absolutely freak out when they look up from a meal and discover a cucumber in their dining area. Like everything popular on the internet, “cucumbers scaring cats” videos spawned a passionate community, complete with a subreddit. And now it’s experiencing its next stage of internet evolution: a viral backlash.
The first video to have really taken off appears to have been posted to YouTube by a Japanese account in May; in July, for reasons lost to the mists of the internet, it was picked up as a viral video by several American outlets.
Animal-behavior experts haven’t reached a consensus as to why a surprise cucumber triggers cats’ panic response — it’s either the shock of seeing an unfamiliar object in their usually safe food zone or an instinctive reaction to something that looks like their ancestral predator, the snake. Either way, it’s clear from video after video that most cats lose their damn minds when this happens to them:
“In a time where showing genitals on the internet is not shocking anymore, tears are a new form of pornography.” That’s the thesis behind Webcam Tears, a Tumblr by artist Dora Moutot that collects videos of people — mostly women — weeping on camera.
When the Paris-based Moutot talks about pornography, she’s not just claiming that seeing a stranger cry can be startling — although that’s certainly part of it. She truly means that crying turns people on. Moutot described viewers’ varied reactions to her lachrymal art project in an interview with the Daily Mail:
Moutot’s “emotional porn” with a side of voyeurism is, in a way, the latest mutation of our ever-growing, ever-evolving selfie culture. It was inspired by Laurel Nakadate, an artist who photographed her tears daily for an entire year. Nakadate’s Only the Lonely, which arrived in 2011, was her way of responding to the rise of photo as diary, especially “happy self-portraits people make day after day with their cell phone cameras and post on Facebook.”
But while Nakadate may have been responding to the unreality of projecting constant happiness through our Facebook accounts — a lot of people “practice sadness every day,” after all — Moutot has transformed it back into a different form of unreality.
Even unscripted, voyeuristic porn, showing the subjects in their private moments, is filtered through a camera — a point of which Moutot is well aware.
“Computers became the witness/spectators of our lives,” she writes. “We eat in front of them and we fall asleep next to them. We talk through them, we dance, we laugh and we masturbate in front of them. But we also cry in front of them.”
We do, and then we submit those tears to Tumblr. Is participating in Webcam Tears another version of the daily performance we put on for our Facebook friends, or more like Nakadate’s intentional and measured resistance to it?You can decide for yourself. Moutot is still taking submissions — she’s received more than 70 thus far.
In the wake of Wednesday’s massacre that left 14 dead in San Bernardino, California — the 355th mass shooting in the U.S. this year — politicians once again offered their thoughts and prayers, but didn’t offer any concrete plans to stop the killing. One journalist spent the evening on Twitter calling out the reason why, tweeting each member of Congress who #prayedforsanbernardino with the amount of money that person received from the National Rifle Association in the most recent election cycle.
Igor Volsky, of liberal blog ThinkProgress, told MSNBC there’s nothing wrong with “thoughts and prayers,” unless you’re in a position to affect gun policy and all you do about it is think and pray. He believes the NRA is paying elected officials and presidential candidates to make sure they don’t go any further.
And in case you assumed that NRA-backed politicians are just doing what their constituents demand, Volsky also cited recent polls showing that 86 percent of Americans support universal background checks for gun purchasers, and that 55 percent think laws regarding the sale of firearms should be made “more strict.”
Thousands liked and retweeted Volsky’s callouts, but none of the politicians he targeted replied to his accusations. A couple of them did delete their “thoughts and prayers” tweets or block Volsky on Twitter in response, though.
When you step on the scale after thinking you did so well with your New Year’s resolution. When you realize you just sent your mom a text you meant for your bae. When you don’t check the milk before you pour it on your cereal and it’s bad.
When you press the wrong button combo on the vending machine. When that bag of Doritos is just hanging there and won’t come out. When you’re on Skype and someone resets the router.
When the doors close on the subway right as you hit the bottom step. When the door shuts behind you as you’re checking your pocket for your keys. When you get crowned Miss Universe, only to find out you’re the first runner-up. When you post a dank meme, but someone else posts a better one.
It’s okay, buddy. It happens to all of us sometimes.
(Vine from Monday night’s Golden State Warriors–Cleveland Cavaliers game, which was also a showdown between the league’s biggest stars, LeBron James and Steph Curry.)
Microsoft announced today that it is suing the U.S. government over secrecy orders that prevent the company from informing customers when federal agencies request data. The lawsuit, filed today in federal court in Seattle, argues that the gag order is unconstitutional. The statute in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, according to the New York Times, “violates the Fourth Amendment right of its customers to know if the government searches or seizes their property, and it breaches the company’s First Amendment right to speak to its customers.”
The case is not over one specific warrant or investigation, but instead challenges the entire legal process concerning secrecy orders.
In a blog post announcing the legal move, Microsoft president Brad Smith wrote:
The rise of cloud computing — which stores data remotely on servers owned by Microsoft, not the customer — has muddied the waters of who owns what data, and who can access it. The government, Microsoft argues, has been using the statute in order to obtain and read customer’s emails without their knowledge. In the suit, Microsoft says that the Justice department has “exploited the transition to cloud computing as a means of expanding its power to conduct secret investigations.”
The Justice department told the Times that it was reviewing the filing.
Microsoft’s lawsuit, somehow both defensive and offensive, is the latest in a growing trend of tech companies making privacy issues matters of public importance — both out of what they consider civic duty, and out of consumer demand. Apple’s refusal to cooperate in the San Bernardino case made sense both as a stand for privacy rights and as a signal to its customers that it would protect their data. It might have argued that resisting government surveillance was a fiduciary duty to their investors. Similarly, Microsoft today claimed that the gag orders “undermine confidence in the privacy of the cloud and have impaired Microsoft’s right to be transparent with its customers.”
In one of the most embarrassing and inert Silicon Valley feuds in recent memory, Tesla founder Elon Musk and a venture capitalist are slighting each other after the VC criticized a Tesla event.
Last September, VC Stewart Alsop published a post called “Dear @ElonMusk: You should be ashamed of yourself,” every sentence of which is cringe-inducing. In it, Alsop describes attending a launch event for Tesla’s new Model X, which started almost two hours late.
Here’s an excerpt:
To reiterate, the wealthy guy willing to drop $130,000 (sight unseen: “I never did see the Model X. I still really want one.”) on a car is mad that the car is not a death trap, and forgot to pack himself a snack.
Not to be outdone in this pettiness race to the bottom, Musk promptly canceled Alsop’s preorder. Alsop wrote yet another post on Medium announcing the revocation and that he had been banned by Tesla. “When I wrote a [critical] blog post about my BMW … the CEO of BMW didn’t take the car back,” Alsop noted.
On Twitter, Musk referred to all of the attention surrounding the row as a “slow news day,” which, fair.
Others are a little more subtle.
There’s also a Facebook page:
I’ve actually never seen Pulp Fiction so I don’t entirely understand why it’s so funny. Here’s what that feels like:
When we last heard from John Travolta, he was screwing up Idina Menzel’s name. Now, the star of Grease and captive of Scientology is back, in a Reddit meme that is … confusing.
Literally confusing. The subreddit Confused John Travolta, which launched just over a month ago, collects a myriad of edits featuring Travolta’s Pulp Fiction character Vincent Vega stumbling around, looking for an intercom. It’s very relatable, as is the best viral content. “I’ve been confused! That’s me!” is what you’re saying to yourself right now probably.
Here’s the original.
The spread can be traced to this popular post from a month ago.
And now the remixes. Some are pretty straightforward.
This week, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has reached the conclusion that every single hoverboard currently on the market is unsafe. Mashable is reporting that, yesterday, “The CPSC sent out an official notice to retailers, manufacturers and importers with new hoverboard safety standards.” The notice also called for noncompliant hoverboards to be taken off the market.
Hoverboards are independently certified as compliant by Underwriters Laboratories, an independent testing firm used by many electronics manufacturers. Earlier this month, UL introduced a new hoverboard protocol that all manufacturers now have to follow.
The CPSC, the government agency that’s always recalling strollers and stuff, considers devices “that do not meet the safety standards referenced above to be defective, and that they may present a substantial product hazard.”
By the transitive property, hoverboards are now also cool as hell. By owning one, you are looking death straight in the eyes and saying, “Try me.” Do you remember when Felix Baumgartner fell 24 miles to Earth, breaking the sound barrier during free fall? That’s basically hoverboard owners now.
The bottom line is that the algorithm is happening whether you like it or not, and you will continue to see the feeds you actually spend time looking at, liking, and commenting on. But if you’re feeling really adventurous, and/or can’t resist following crudely drawn instructions on your social feed, feel free to turn your phone into an ever-more-menacing notifications hell.
The algorithm is coming! Sometime soon — a widespread but totally unfounded rumor claims tomorrow — Instagram will stop arranging photos in your feed in simple reverse chronological order, instead sorting them algorithmically based on your behavior, similar to how your Facebook news feed works currently. It’s ultimately not a huge deal: The feeds you spend the most time looking at and liking will continue to appear prominently; the feeds you follow out of politeness or obligation, and scroll past quickly, will appear less frequently.
Not a huge deal to you, that is. It’s a huge deal to non-personal feeds — brands and other institutions — and it means that one of social media’s jankiest but most pervasive tactics is back with a vengeance: a photo with an arrow on it.
In an attempt to avoid getting buried by the algorithm, accounts are pleading with their fans to turn on post notifications. Note that this doesn’t mean that the accounts will be unaffected by the algorithm — it means that you will get a notification on your phone every time the account posts a photo. You won’t miss a single blurry vacation photo or fashion ad ever again! I’m not gonna tell you how to live your best Instagram life, but this seems like a bad way to deal with the algorithm.
No, if you’re really worried the algorithm will ruin your Instagram experience, consider that it’s based on your own behavior. The best way to make sure an account you like is still featured at the top of your feed is to continue interacting with its posts via likes and comments. (Update: Likes and comments most likely aren’t the only way to ensure accounts stay at the top of your screen: Instagram almost definitely tracks metrics like the amount of time you spend hovering over a post without actively doing anything, so for accounts you want to see but don’t want to like or comment on — hate follows and crushes, for example — just keep lingering, and Instagram will do the rest.)
If you have to take extra effort to make sure someone’s posts are appearing frequently, it’s probably because … you don’t actually look at or interact with their photos. That’s the thing about algorithms — they hide things that you won’t notice are missing, like people you spoke to twice in high school or that guy you met at a networking event.
(There’s a nakedly capitalist angle to approach this from as well: One of Facebook’s primary ways of bringing in revenue is to charge pages in order to reach more people. The organic reach for large pages generally hovers around two percent, meaning that for each Facebook post, only a single-digit percentage of page subscribers see it. Pages (“Brands”) can then pay Facebook more money in order to have more people see the posts. By introducing an algorithmic feed to Instagram, brands — specifically the ones that do extremely well on the service, like fashion and lifestyle companies — will soon likely see the same dips in organic reach that have wreaked havoc for publishers on Facebook. I hope this paragraph is as fun to read as it was to write.)
The Fat Jew, an Instagram celebrity and performance artist otherwise known as Josh Ostrovsky, is also infamous for what some claim is joke theft. He, up until recently, would often take other people’s work and upload it to his account without credit. A lot of aspiring comedians and other creative people hate him for this.
Seeking to give the Rotund Semite a taste of his own medicine, Twitter user @updog7 took pictures of every single page of Ostrovsky’s new book Money, Pizza, Respect and uploaded them to Twitter. They were even nice enough to upload them in reverse order, so you can just scroll down the page if, for some reason, you wanted to read an entire book via low-res scans. The pages were also compiled into a PDF available to download on Google Drive.
The account posting these pages is a joke in itself, mimicking the handle and avatar of @uptowndogfunk, an account that is allegedly a Fat Jew sock puppet account. The idea being that @uptowndogfunk would plagiarize people’s jokes and then the Fat Jew would credit that user, extricating himself from plagiarism charges and downgrading to shoddy sourcing.
Update: It appears that the tweet linking to a PDF of the entire book “has been withheld in response to a report from the copyright holder.”
Happy Tuesday.
If you weren’t immediately bowled over by Atlas, Boston Dynamics’ humanoid battle robot funded by the military, you might love Spot, Boston Dynamics’ dog battle robot funded by the military. See Spot play. See Spot roll over. See Spot gain sentience and take out the little real dog trying to warn the humans about the dangers of creating robot dogs. As venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson, who posted the video to YouTube, notes, all the other models of Spot are owned by the Department of Defense.
Talking to Engadget by phone, the members of DJ Detweiler laid out the full scope of the effort:
“4’33”” laid out the argument that “silence” doesn’t exist in the way we think it does — that even in a supposedly silent theater we’re surrounded by noise. Like, say, someone playing Justin Bieber. The Detweilers are just trying to prove this point on the internet. Pulling a track from a digital service is as close as you can get to true silence, but online, it’s just generated more noise, this post included.
Last week, the music collective known as DJ Detweiler posted a copyright takedown notice it had received from Soundcloud, explaining that its remix of John Cage’s famous “4’33”” — a modernist composition of 273 seconds of musicians not playing their instruments — had been removed from the service.
This premise is, of course, clearly ridiculous: You can’t copyright silence, even in specific increments of time. (Though the Cage estate has sued over musicians who use Cage’s name on their own silent recordings.)
Whether or not “4’33’’” is actually silent is a contentious matter. “4’33”” was written to be performed in a theater; the idea is that each performance is composed of whatever sounds occur during the interval. The John Cage Trust even offers a “4’33”” app that allows people to record their own versions of the work, “which teaches us that there’s no such thing as ‘silence’ (and that there’s joy to be found in paying close attention to the sounds around).”
According to a statement provided to Engadget by Soundcloud, “The upload referenced in the screenshot was not a track of silence and was taken down because it included Justin Bieber’s What Do You Mean without the rightsholder’s permission.” Because the original track was unavailable, some reports took the name “4’33”” at its word and reported that Soundcloud had pulled a completely silent track.
But, as is often the case online, what had initially turned into a protest against the United States’ archaic copyright system has since morphed into media criticism.
Earlier today on Facebook, famed director and screenwriter Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull) shared a video of Nicolas Cage, the internet meme-god, reenacting a famous Nicolas Cage meem [sic]: “YOU DON’T SAY.” The meem was re-created during the production of Schrader’s upcoming film Dog Eat Dog.
“Nic Cage does a Nic Cage meem,” Schrader wrote on Facebook. “On the set of DOG EAT DOG Nicholas performed the original and most well known Nic Cage meem. He was playing an armed robber in a policeman’s uniform.”
That scene — featuring Cage with his head reared back, eyes wide, yelling “You don’t say!” — comes from an ancient and primitive meem used to dispel stupid people on message boards …
… the facial expression of which was taken from a scene in the 1988 film Vampire’s Kiss.
The meem cycle has completed one full iteration, and now we begin anew.
Welcome to Following, New York Magazine’s new limited-run site about internet culture, social media, and the many weird and fascinating things people do online. Forty-six years ago last Thursday, the very first message was sent over ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet: “lo.” The system crashed before the full message — the word login — could be completed. For the next two months, Following will operate in the spirit of those auspicious beginnings, exploring the connections and communities created on the internet, as well as the glitches and confusions that keep it interesting. We’ll write about social-media celebrities and hashtag subcultures, Twitter flame wars and Facebook campaigns, artifacts of the old web and curiosities of the new one. We’ll post videos everyone is — or should be — watching and pictures the whole internet is sharing. “We,” in this case, is Kyle Chayka, Brian Feldman, and myself, as well as an array of contributors bringing reported dispatches from as many corners of the web we can reach. We’ve all spent way too much time online and yet still find ourselves stumbling into odd and fascinating wormholes. I bet many of you feel that way, too, and I’m excited to hear from readers who are similarly enthralled (or, as the case may be, disgusted) by the internet’s oddities and innovations. My email address is max.read@nymag.com, and my Twitter handle is @max_read. What is your favorite site on the internet? What communities fascinate you? Which hashtags have you addicted? What link do you find yourself compelled to share? Who — or what — are you following?
What is Mountain Dew, exactly? According to the CEO of Pepsi (quoted in an excellent BuzzFeed investigation into the question from this weekend), it’s “an attitude. It’s a fantastic attitude in a bottle.” The flavor is … some sort of … citrus? “We don’t try to say what color the product is internally,” the vice-president of marketing says. About the only thing you can say for certain about Mtn Dew (as it is stylized on the bottles) is that it’s the official soda of the internet. Surpassed only by Doritos as a signifier of nerd-dom, it’s essentially the base of the food pyramid for people who spend marathon sessions in front of a computer. The reasons for this are in part practical and historical. Dew has more caffeine than Coke or Pepsi, and naturally, programmers and computer geeks gravitate toward the most caffeinated by the numbers: If you have a dungeon raid to undertake or a thorny programming problem to untangle, only coffee can do you better (but requires more effort and upkeep). And once Dew became known as the geek’s drink of choice, it entered programmer lore. You can find it in coding manuals; some developers have constructed pages devoted to accomplishments that were fueled by Dew. In the 1995 book The Dynamics of Software Development, Jim McCarthy writes that one of the main ways a manager can support his programmers “is simply buy large quantities of Mountain Dew.” Mountain Dew has therefore become a slight pejorative, often appearing in the same sentence as neckbeard or hard-core gamer. YouTube star Steven Williams, also known as boogie2298, frequently uses Mountain Dew as a trope when portraying his character, Francis. Francis is also known in some circles as Captain Logic, a (slightly) exaggerated parody of a certain subset of Redditors.
Of course, this didn’t happen without PepsiCo’s help. Dew marketing aggressively targets some of the most diligent internet users: gamers and programmers. Starting in 2007, the brand has released limited editions of something called Game Fuel every few years, tying into releases of Halo or World of Warcraft or Call of Duty.
But doing the Dew is not without its hazards. The drink was also embroiled in a scandal in the gaming community known as Doritosgate, years before Gamergate made it “about ethics in games journalism.” In the end, the controversy boiled down to the fact that people didn’t trust journalist Geoff Keighley because he appeared on-camera conducting interviews surrounded by branded product placement for Doritos and Mountain Dew. Before Gamergate exploded, this image was shorthand for supposed corruption in the gaming press:
Never one to let an opportunity for corporate synergy to slip through the cracks, Pepsi started testing a Doritos-flavored Mountain Dew last year. Hey, at least you can definitely say what this one tastes like. (Despair.)
The backlash was immediate and fierce. What could have been the start of a discussion about fervent horse fandom with slightly racist undertones was instead a discussion about a tweet showing a horse and a black woman side-by-side and asking who was really the better sportsperson.
Oh, my.
The L.A. Times hasn’t taken the tweet down, despite the outcry on Twitter. It did, however, change its headline to “Are fans right to be upset that Serena Williams beat American Pharoah for SI Sportsperson of the Year?”
And the poll asking who the “real sportsman of the year” should be — which Williams was winning 3 to 1 — has been changed, too. It now asks whether a horse should be eligible for the award in the first place.
Tennis superstar Serena Williams was named Sports Illustrated’s 2015 Sportsperson of the Year today — but there’s apparently a contingent of people on the internet who think American Pharaoh, a rare Triple Crown–winning horse (important: not a person), was more deserving of the award.
And the Los Angeles Times, in an attempt to cover the controversy, only ended up making a dumb debate even dumber. With a single tweet, the newspaper lent legitimacy to a pretty silly argument and prompted accusations of racism. All in a day’s work on social media.
The original article, by Chuck Schilken, was actually a fairly nuanced look at the bad debate — pointing out that “horses can’t really display sportsmanship,” and noting the significance of Williams’s return to Indian Wells after boycotting the venue for 14 years over a racist incident.
Sports Illustrated’s reasoning for giving Serena the award was clearly laid out. She had an utterly dominant record of 53 wins against only 3 losses in 2015, and was ranked No. 1 every week of the year. Her reconciliation with Indian Wells, and her accompanying op-ed explaining her reasoning, only added to her impact as a “sportsperson,” not just an athlete.
American Pharaoh won SI’s reader’s poll for this award. He is an impressive horse. He is not a person.
But all of this nuance was lost once the L.A. Times story got its headline: “Serena Williams or American Pharaoh? Who Is the Real Sportsperson of the Year? [POLL].”
And the problem was only compounded when the newspaper tweeted about it:
The eternal debate about Facebook friends (“friends?”) whose political views differ from your own goes something like this: Life is hard enough without the possibility of walking into a trigger for sadness, hopelessness, and rage on your own Facebook news feed. On the other hand, don’t you have a responsibility to engage with opposing views and treat them seriously, thereby testing and improving your own beliefs?” But the 2016 presidential race has given us a third hand: “Donald Trump exists.”
Trump, America’s most beloved novelty hot-air balloon, currently leads the race for the Republican presidential nomination, but his recent blanket statement on Muslim immigration was the tipping point for many people who previously either treated Trump as an amusing sideshow or tried to understand where he was coming from. But to truly cut off Trump means cutting off our friends who support him, and that’s where Friends Who Like Trump comes in.
It’s a site that redirects you to a Facebook search for all your friends who “like” the Donald on Facebook. Some of them may have been actively cheering Trump on in posts you muted or scrolled past; others may surprise you with their quiet support for the loud — very loud — billionaire.
Unfriend them all, if you feel called to do so. Or don’t. That decision is between you and your god (Facebook Inc., Menlo, California, Mark Zuckerberg, chairman).
It has over 45,000 likes, and the author quickly disputes any arguments that he found it elsewhere. Seems real! But that hasn’t stopped multiple people daily from tweeting it like it’s their own joke, not even bothering to throw quotations marks around it, let alone retweet. In fact, most probably haven’t even seen the original. It also exists as an image on funnyjunk.com and various Twitter screenshots. Someone even tweeted a nice image-macro version at Marc Andreessen.
The joke’s still funny, and it will no doubt remain relevant till Trump is either knocked out of the race or becomes racist-dictator-in-chief and quashes all dissent. But if this profusion proves anything, it’s that social-media humor is incredibly derivative. Even if you think you made that hilarious tweet up, it’s probably been done before.
Is Donald Trump more like a YouTube comment section come to life, or a villain in a movie where the protagonist is a dog? In an insightful blog post, Andy Baio dissects the former joke-meme. You’ve probably seen it around somewhere — it has spread through Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr like wildfire, but it’s unclear where it came from, or if everyone just realized that Trump spouts the kind of opinions you find high up on Reddit at the same time.
Baio traces it back to a single tweet from April 27, 2011, long before our current national nightmare of Trump candidacy. “Donald Trump is the living embodiment of an Internet message board troll,” @PoorMeinNYC writes. But the one-liner reappears constantly, albeit with slight variations. Journalist Olivia Nuzzi came up with the influential “Trump is like a YouTube comment thread that achieved sentience.” Marc Andreessen apparently overheard it once.
The meme fractured further. New York Magazine’s own Jerry Saltz tweeted a viral version with a photo of handwritten text. Then Brian Gaar took first prize on December 7 with a 40,000-liked tweet, “Donald Trump is basically a YouTube comment section running for president.”
The results of Baio’s investigation show that the viral success of a joke sometimes isn’t so much content as it is timing. Do Trump jokes do best when the candidate himself is being particularly ridiculous? Or is that when people are most likely to retweet? The profusion is surreal, but Baio notes that it’s not just Fat Jew–style plagiarism. Rather, it’s a case of multiple discovery — the idea that scientific innovations are often discovered simultaneously by different groups of people.
I noticed another example of this phenomenon in the joke about Trump and movies about dogs. It’s a good line — Trump has that shaggy haircut and vicious grin that marks him as an enemy for any right-thinking 6-year-old (or, hopefully, American voter). You could just see Trump capering after a tiny golden-retriever puppy that has his toupee in its mouth. In fact, lots of people have.
But the original tweet about Trump and dogs is probably @ruinedpicnic on August 29, 2015:
To verify his identity and satisfy his fans’ call for more, Wright promised to release a new video on December 31. To Wehner’s surprise, Wright followed through, uploading a new puzzle called “11B 3 1369” to YouTube.
He also hid additional clues on USB drives in locations around Europe, and released their coordinates to eager seekers.
At this point, the viral marketing and terrorist threat hypotheses have been ruled out, and it’s clear what Wright is really engaged in: art — albeit a strange, very 2016, very internet brand of guerrilla art whose target demographic is 4chan’s paranormal message board, /x/.
Wright told Wehner he feels “a call from within” to expand his puzzle, and that Poland was just the beginning. “There will be other locations,” he said.
A macabre video with encoded references to death, plague, and the White House has fascinated certain corners of the internet since it emerged on a DVD mailed to a Swedish tech blog last October — or maybe it was found on a park bench in Spain. At first, no one was certain. The creepy footage, starring a man in a birdlike plague doctor mask, is backed by a grating digital whine, a sure sign of an encoded image hiding in its audio track. The whole package, titled “11b-x-1371,” made for a tantalizing puzzle.
Initially, it wasn’t clear what the video was supposed to be: a viral marketing stunt? A game? A terrorist threat?
One of the video’s hidden messages, “RED LIPSLIKE TENTH,” was an anagram for “kill the president,” and the geographic coordinates of the White House were also encoded in the video, reported the Daily Dot’s Mike Wehner, a reporter who has been researching the video since its early days.
Some also worried that gruesome images concealed in the video’s soundtrack pointed to a serial killer bragging about his work. The images of killings turned out to be from slasher flicks, though, plus one from the real-life case of the Boston Strangler.
After weeks of digging, Wehner and others determined that the video was shot in Zofiówka Sanatorium, an abandoned Polish mental hospital. This made sense considering that Gadgetzz, the site that first published the video, claimed it was mailed from Poland.
Now Wehner is in touch with the video’s creator, who goes by the alias “Parker Warner Wright,” and has produced the most thorough article available on “11b-x-1371,” its mysteries, and its origins.
Wright claims to be a U.S. citizen living in Poland, and says the U.S. government is aware of, and possibly amused by, his little puzzles. They’ve been in contact, he claims, and don’t consider him a threat.
What is it about technology that turns public officials into bad science-fiction authors? Take San Bernardino County DA Michael Ramos, whose office wrote in a court filing obtained by Ars Technica that Syed Rizwan Farook’s iPhone “may contain evidence that can only be found on the seized phone that it was used as a weapon to introduce a lying dormant cyber pathogen that endangers San Bernardino’s infrastructure.”
Uhhhh … ? As you might be able to guess, this is … nonsense.
iOS security expert Jonathan Zdziarski confirms: “It sounds like he’s making up these terms as he goes,” he told Ars Technica. “We’ve never used these terms in computer science. I think what he’s trying to suggest is that Farook was somehow working with someone to install a program on the iPhone that would infect the local network with some kind of virus or worm or something along those lines. Anything is possible, right? Do they have any evidence whatsoever to show there is any kind of cyber pathogen on the network or any logs or network captures to show that Farook’s phone tried to introduce some unauthorized code into the system? … They are essentially saying that a magical unicorn might exist on this phone.”
San Bernardino County, for the record, distanced itself from the filing. “The county didn’t have anything to do with this brief. It was filed by the district attorney,” a spokesperson told Ars.
Currently, Apple only signs a few software updates a year, making HSMs and their protection a relative non-issue. But if law enforcement agencies are making regular requests, Apple would likely need to set up a dedicated in-house infrastructure for cracking phones — what Matthew Green, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University’s Information Security Institute, calls “a factory for unlocking phones.” Once a significant number of people and resources are assigned to accessing iPhones for law enforcement, Green says, “that’s when risk gets really high of the software getting out.”
Since the act of creating the software to bypass the phone’s encryption will, by definition, make iPhones more vulnerable, according to MIT technologist Jeffrey Schiller, it constitutes a backdoor for the government. “In general, [backdoors require] more complex mechanisms to implement then security systems that do not provide for it,” Schiller wrote on his blog. “Complex systems fail in complex ways. Complex systems by their very nature are less secure because it is harder to reason about their security properties.”
Apple Access Requests Appear to Target Political Activists
A months-long investigation into device-access requests made by the city’s police department to Apple and other technology companies has found a disproportionate number of political activists and groups among the targets. Though most of the department’s requests concerned investigations into drug trafficking or gang activity, a significant number concerned civil rights groups, anti-police brutality activists, and, in one case, a local politician and well-known police critic. The access requests are often used to target phones taken into evidence following arrest, and because of their wide berth allow police access to nearly every aspect of a phone, including its messages. The increasing reliance on technology companies to break into their own products is reflected across the country: Technology companies say they field thousands of device-access requests from law enforcement agencies at every level — local, state, and federal — every year, and even more that they cannot legally acknowledge or discuss.
Now that Apple has created its iPhone-unlocking factory, who will its customers be? On the domestic front, it’s helpful to look at other government surveillance. The StingRay phone-surveillance system was originally built for the military and spy agencies by the Harris Corporation. Designed to mimic cell towers, StingRays trick cell phones into transmitting the location and identifying information of the owner, as well as those who happen to be physically near them. Documents obtained by the ACLU of Northern California also showed that StingRays can bug and record phone conversations. Also known as Triggerfish, among other things, they’ve been in regular use by federal law enforcement since at least the mid-1990s. Over the past decade and a half, though, their use has spread to state and local law enforcement organizations in nearly half of America, largely thanks to grants from the Department of Homeland Security.
Here are a few ways that local law enforcement used their new toys:
● Chicago police regularly use StingRays to monitor protesters and activists● Baltimore police found a cell-phone thief● A full third of StingRay uses by Tallahassee police between 2007 and 2014 were for property crimes● Miami police made an emergency purchase of StingRays specifically to monitor protesters outside the Free Trade Area of the Americas Conference in 2003
Most experts I spoke with saw a similar path for encrypted-device access. “There is definitely the possibility of this sort of demand becoming abused in the same nature as StingRays have, particularly if the government begins demanding that the company receiving the order remain silent about the fact that they have received it, as they so often do,” said Ross Schulman, senior policy counsel at the New America Foundation’s Open Technology Institute, referring to the fact that both the Harris Corporation and the federal government often force local law enforcement agencies to sign non-disclosure agreements upon receiving surveillance equipment.
“Everything starts out as an exclusive tool,” said Jonathan Zdziarski, an iOS security expert. “These tools are the same tools I’ve written myself on older iPhones. The tool they’re requesting exists because I wrote it. My tools went from being used in terrorist cases, fast forward, cops are using it to jailbreak their girlfriend’s phones .… We’ve already seen this play out.”
That path of military to federal law enforcement to local police forces brings opportunities for civil liberties- and privacy violations, increasing more and more as smaller and smaller agencies get their hands on them. “If they have that tool, they’re gonna use it,” said Stephen Downing, a former deputy chief with the LAPD and a speaker for Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, who took care to note that he didn’t firmly fall on either side of the issue. “Some, like with all else, will abuse it. We’ve clearly seen abuses across the country at the federal level and at the local level, so if they had that capability, it’s gonna be used.”
On March 22, Apple and the FBI will meet in federal court to determine the fate of an iPhone: the 5s owned by San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. But what’s at stake is really the future of all iPhones — and maybe all phones in general.
“The thing that nobody’s talking about is messaging,” said Green. “If you look at FBI statements over last year, they talk about phone decryption and they talk about messaging services, how they can’t decrypt messages. What is not being discussed is the implications of if the FBI uses this to go after messaging systems.”
It’s not hard to see a future in which, according to Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the ACLU, the government writes its own software to spy on Americans using their own devices, then has a judge sign a court order, and sends it off to Apple’s phone-unlocking factory. Previously, if the government wanted to record what was going on inside our homes, they had to break in and mic the place themselves. “We’ve brought the microphones into our homes,” said Soghoian.
The implications specifically for the War on Drugs are striking. According to the U.S. Court System’s 2014 Wiretap Report, 89 percent of all applications for phone wiretaps by law enforcement agencies were for drug cases. Anonymous government officials have been making overtures toward using a favorable ruling against “drug traffickers” in the media. “We know that drug dealers store evidence on devices, like inventory, and that dealers take photos of drug stashes, which sometimes include geotags,” said Zdziarski. “I can see typical law enforcement rifling through phones to see what’s interesting.” Downing said, “As you increase the scale, you increase the opportunity for abuse. The less oversight, the more abuse, basically, that’s been our experience.”
Apple Faces Familiar Fight, This Time in China
Apple and an intransigent government are entering a showdown over “backdoor” access to locked devices. Sound familiar? Think again: This time, it’s China. According to sources at Apple, speaking anonymously due to the sensitivity of the subject, after several weeks of pressure and legal maneuvering the Chinese government has essentially given Apple an ultimatum: Allow us access to locked iPhones, or close up shop in the country entirely. Where Apple might once have been able to avoid the problem by citing strict legal rules or political pressure in the U.S., the recent ruling upholding a judicial order forcing Apple to install a new version of its software on San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook’s phone gives it less wiggle room. Adding to Apple’s woes is the fact that China represents about a quarter of Apple’s global sales — and its continued growth there is vital to its bottom line.
“The people I would worry about are foreign governments. People who have demonstrated they’re willing and able to hack U.S. security systems,” said Green. “The OPM hack” — in which Chinese hackers stole personal information about some 18 million government employees and contractors from the Office of Personnel Management from 2013 to 2015 — “was our Pearl Harbor.” Worth noting, too, are the at least three separate instances in recent years that Apple software has been targeted by groups originating in China, as well as FBI director James Comey’s 2014 claim, in an interview with 60 Minutes, that the Chinese government has hacked every major American company.
“It’s inevitable that the tools will end up in other people’s hands,” Zdziarski said. “We’re talking about every other government following in U.S. footsteps, ordering Apple to do what they want. It’s like ordering Apple to create an atomic bomb and then just putting a padlock on it.” Green agrees, saying that a ruling in the U.S. government’s favor would make it difficult for Apple to prevent other countries from compelling it — or other tech companies — to provide them with the software. “Once Apple announces they’re going to do this for the U.S. government, they’ll need to give that capability to China,” he said. And Apple certainly intends to keep operating in China, whose iPhone purchases surpassed America’s in April.
Elizabeth Rowe, director of the University of Florida’s Program in Intellectual Property Law, says that while there’s no direct international legal precedent that would be set by a U.S. court ruling in the U.S. government’s favor, “American courts are a world leader. If a court in China says Apple should do this, the fact that American courts allow this would hurt Apple in a Chinese court. It would be hard to say with a straight face that Apple can comply with America and not with China. Once the floodgates are open, they’re kind of open all over.”
The vulnerabilities being exploited by private, or non-governmental, interests is a concern, too. “The fact is that this software will absolutely become a target,” said Schulman. “Apple is good at security, but against a truly determined opponent it is hard to be sure that any kind of security is enough. The mere existence of the software the FBI is demanding is a danger.” Additionally, the software the FBI is requesting constitutes a trade secret, according to Rowe, “and they sure as heck do not want to give that over to the FBI.” If the key were to get out, even if it ended up being the government’s fault, it would regardless cease to be a trade secret by definition, and susceptible to then-legal use by competitors.”
The FBI is asking Apple to write software to break into a terrorist’s iPhone. Apple says that doing so would compromise every iPhone-owner’s security. Experts in fields from computer science to law enforcement to cryptography to trade-secret law are all increasingly worried about the implications of the government winning the case, which Apple has promised to take to the Supreme Court if necessary.
Based on conversations with experts, we’ve imagined a set of hypothetical future news stories (in italics) describing scenarios that could come to pass if the FBI wins, followed by explanations for why these stories are realistic.
FBI Comes Under Attack for Alleged Apple-Key Leak
As human rights groups across the globe amass evidence they claim demonstrates that Apple’s top-secret developer key has fallen into the hands of authoritarian governments and police forces, several sources inside the Federal Bureau of Investigation say the domestic law-enforcement agency has begun an internal review process to see whether the digital signature used by Apple to authenticate updates to its phones could have been leaked by FBI agents or contractors working on the phones. Apple has so far declined to comment, but privacy advocates and experts say that there is little oversight or accountability in the complex and multi-party process by which Apple “cracks” iPhones for law enforcement, and claim it is possible — if not likely — that the key was copied during one procedure and sold on the black market. Complicating the FBI’s investigation, sources say, is the fact that neither Apple nor the FBI know whether the key has actually been leaked.
The court order obtained by the FBI directs Apple to create an alternate version of iOS that would help agents circumvent the lock on the phone — a major component of Apple’s heightened encryption, which has been strongly criticized by the government for not leaving it an easy backdoor. The FBI can’t create this software itself because Apple, like all other major technology companies, code signs its software updates with a secret key that ensures other parties, like hackers or the government, can’t send you malware that looks like a legitimate software update. (For more on code-signing and other words, phrases, and concepts that might be confusing, see our Apple vs. FBI glossary.)
According to Steven Bellovin, co-director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Center at Columbia University’s Data Science Institute, and one of the creators of USENET, Apple can comply with that request in one of two ways: Create new software specific to that phone’s serial number (and handle each future case individually), or create a more general version. “Either has its drawbacks,” said Bellovin. “In the former case, there’s an issue of [the government] needing too much access to the signature mechanism” — attracting parties who want to subvert Apple’s signing process, or signers — “in the latter, [simply giving the government] the code is very risky because it can unlock many phones.”
The importance of signing — authenticating — the software can’t be overstated. The key used to sign software is likely under a megabyte, making it extremely easy to put onto a thumb drive, attach to an email, or share on social media. Additionally, Apple has no real way of knowing whether the key has gotten out. Likely what Apple uses to keep the key secret is something called a Hardware Security Module (HSM), which puts the process of signing software through even more encryption and requires multiple people to access the key. HSMs are difficult to use and are expensive, even more so when you factor in the additional human labor.
According to a short post by Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook, the company has launched its internet.org Free Basics app across India. “Everyone in India nationwide can access free internet services for health, education, jobs and communication,” the founder and CEO writes.
The post comes below an idyllic photo of farmer Ganesh Nimbalkar, who uses Free Basics to access news about the weather and farm commodities, Zuckerberg explains. “By using Free Basics, Ganesh has doubled his crop yield.” But that’s not quite the whole story.
Internet.org has been widely criticized for allowing its users to access only a small slice of the internet, limited to whichever sites and apps Facebook chooses to incorporate. Some fear that as users become accustomed to it, they’ll mistake the gated experience for the actual open internet, with its billions of sites and services. “It would be naïve to argue that such a package of services is or can be a substitute for the full Internet,” writes Mahesh Uppal in an op-ed for Hindustan Times.
The platform could easily violate principles of net neutrality, though Facebook argues that since it’s not a telecommunications company, those rules don’t apply. What’s more, Zuckerberg mentions that Free Basics is being carried solely through the Reliance network. But that’s only the fourth-largest provider in India, with 109.90 million customers in 2015. It’s kind of like if Facebook were only available on Verizon.
The company is presenting its Free Basics platform as a revolutionary tool, and no doubt it’ll help millions of people like Nimbalkar. But having access to the entire, unmediated Internet would help them a lot more.
On days like Monday, the one-story days, the days where everyone collectively gasps and starts Twittering upon finding out that a god is mortal after all, the newspeople still have to put out the paper. So David Bowie was dead, and the BBC had to produce the compulsory roundup of reactions to his passing from other famous persons. And under those conditions, actor Simon Pegg got credit for a very astute Bowie tweet that he didn’t write.
In fairness to the BBC, the provenance of the tweet was a bit confusing. Simon Pegg used to have an official Twitter account, but in December 2014, he stopped tweeting and delegated it to his PR team instead. So @simonpegg is now Pegg News. But there’s still a Simon Pegg on Twitter — @simon_pegg — who’s constantly getting mistaken for the Shaun of the Dead star.
That guy posted the Bowie tweet that someone at the BBC misattributed to the more famous Pegg, and then spent Monday morning trying to alert the press that (a) He is not THAT Simon Pegg, and (b) He didn’t even write the tweet in question.
This particular Bowie tribute was first tweeted by Dean Podesta — @jesuisdean — but, as any good tweet is wont to do, got picked up by copycats and started spreading without attribution, making it harder to track down the original. Further complicating matters, Podesta’s "4 billion years" sentiment wasn’t an original one. Back in November, Justin Bieber reacted to tweets from his most ardent fans, and one of those tweets was — surprise! — "@justinbieber If I’m ever sad, I just remember the world is 4 billion years old and somehow I managed to exist at the same time as you."
So, not only was the source of the tweet not Simon Pegg, but its intended recipient wasn’t Bowie. (It might not even have been Bieber. The idea behind it is a nice one, which means it’s probably already on a greeting card or a generic home-décor poster somewhere. Hard to say, really.)
But to his credit, Other Simon Pegg did at least part of the legwork and got the correction — from the BBC, at least. A small victory on a sad day.
Other outlets, including The Hollywood Reporter, still credit Pegg with the sentiment.
Sean Rad, the founder and CEO of dating app Tinder, dislikes journalists. In an interview with the Evening Standard, he says of them, “Too many are not seeking truth but fame.” In the same interview, he says a “supermodel, someone really, really famous” is “taunt[ing]” and “begging” him for sex. Perhaps the problem lies not with the journalists but with Sean Rad.
Rad and Tinder have not been well-treated in the press over the last couple of years, largely thanks to a sexual-harassment lawsuit filed by ousted co-founder Whitney Wolfe. Rad wasn’t specifically accused of harassment, but was said to have been present when his close friend and fellow co-founder, former CMO Justin Mateen, called Wolfe a “whore” and a “gold digger.” (Wolfe, who settled with Tinder, has since gone on to found Bumble, a Tinder competitor.)
Not much about the Evening Standard interview indicates that Rad is the kind of CEO you might trust to control a harassment problem. Specifically, this bit, where he … well, read it for yourself:
Struggling to remember a word that describes “someone who gets turned on by intellectual stuff” — someone like Rad — he comes up with “sodomy.” (What he probably means is sapiosexual, which is not a real sexual orientation or fetish but rather a word invented for Facebook quizzes and identity-formation listicles.)
Having established to interviewer Charlotte Edwards that he is not just some tech roué — that he is a sapiosexual who will even bed ugly chicks — Rad is free to move on to his other subject: journalists. He’s particularly furious at Nancy Jo Sales, who indicted Tinder in a Vanity Fair piece on the rise of hookup culture. Rad tells Edwards that he learned “some stuff about [Sales] as an individual that will make you think differently” about her. He does not elaborate.
Tinder already went nuclear over Sales’s article back in August with a bizarre, preplanned Twitter meltdown remarkably similar in tone to Rad’s interview: self-righteous, manic, and factually challenged. Thinking the press is corrupt, fame-hungry, stupid is fine! But sometimes the problem isn’t biased and negative journalism. Sometimes the problem is just that you’re an asshole.
A Twitch channel with more than 30,000 fans is experiencing heavy criticism after it went dark and changed hands following its owner’s divorce.
Ara_Gaming was, according to the BBC, on hiatus for months while its host, known as Sarah, “resolved personal issues including divorcing her husband.” Sarah reportedly offered control of the channel as part of the divorce settlement.
When Ara_Gaming returned over the weekend — “Sorry for the wait! Lots of changes, can’t wait to talk to you all!,” a related Twitter account wrote — it featured a new host, named Crystal, and fans were not pleased. Sarah’s ex-husband was then forced to clarify the arrangement.
The account’s new owner is clearly unfamiliar with managing an online presence, unprepared for the backlash that the sudden change created. He sent a tweet to online “expert” Gary Vaynerchuk saying as much.
While fans continue to criticize the account’s new owner over his handling of the channel, Sarah has mostly remained silent. Yesterday, she posted a single tweet on a new Twitter account. “Thank you for the outpouring of love and support,” she wrote. “I miss my friends and wish I could explain further. My lawyer is looking into my options.”
But on the street, displaying that identifying information is still considered taboo — even though popular Twitter and Facebook users reach larger audiences than a single billboard. There’s no “retrieve the author’s location and post this message as a billboard in his neighborhood” button on Twitter (yet). If there were, would we use it?
Probably.
Would we use it for good?
Shaming people for their bad behavior on social media has become such a prevalent part of life online that Jon Ronson wrote an entire book about it, but less than a year after it was released, the scales by which we measure the costs and benefits of online callout culture continue to wobble. This week, an NGO in Brazil shamed racists by printing their objectionable tweets and Facebook posts as billboards and posting them in the writers’ neighborhoods.
Civil-rights organization Criola started the campaign, called “Virtual Racism, Real Consequences,” after a popular black weather presenter was targeted with racist comments on the Facebook page of news program Nacional Journal, the BBC reports.
The internet typically calls out trolls by posting screenshots of their comments, or by amplifying those comments through Twitter and Facebook’s built-in share and retweet buttons. With a single click, the racist, harasser, or person you feel is Wrong on the Internet winds up with a larger audience than they ever expected. The public nature of social media goes both ways: It can be used to harass, but also to tie one’s own rope.
Criola’s Racismo Virtual is the real-world equivalent. They’ve tracked down racist comments in which the authors naively shared their location, and put up the message as billboards where the writers are likely to see them.
“Those people [who post abuse online] think they can sit in the comfort of their homes and do whatever they want on the internet. We don’t let that happen. They can’t hide from us, we will find them,” founder Jurema Werneck told the BBC.
But unlike Twitter, where a retweet bears the author’s username and photo, allowing others to find them and join in the ridicule, Criola’s billboards pixelate and redact the identifying information. If the writers come face-to-face with their own words, they might be the only ones who realize it.
Right now, there’s a line — a blurry line, but it’s there — between an acceptable callout on social media and the real-life analogue, but it’s not clear if it’s an ethical line or a programmatic one. The “retweet” button exists, and Twitter is public: Ergo, it must be okay to call attention to something objectionable by retweeting it.
According to a statistical breakdown on Something Awful of more than 1,600 “CAD” comics, 94.44 percent of comics inspected feature what is known as B^U (tilt your head left; it’s an emoticon version of the signature Buckley face) — half-closed eyelids and half-open mouths. (The fact that there was even a statistical breakdown being done should indicate the scale of criticism that “CAD” faced.) In addition, character dialogue is often excessive: Buckley tends to tell, not show.
What I’m trying to say is, well before the publication of “Loss,” “CAD” faced considerable criticism. The comic could be amusing at best and puerile at worst, resorting to violence as a punch line with noticeable frequency. By taking a turn into the gravely serious world of reproductive trauma with “Loss,” Buckley blindsided readers. It was like Carrot Top remade Sophie’s Choice. The last strip to mention Lilah’s pregnancy prior to “Loss” had been published 10 installments and nearly a month prior, and readers found the sudden attempt at gravity hilarious. So they did what the internet does: turned “Loss” — again, a comic strip about miscarriage — into a running joke. One that still continues to this day.
For instance, here is a “Loss” edit from earlier this year. (Like most memes, the vast majority of “Loss” edits are topical, but it gets much weirder.)
If it’s weird to you that people on the internet would take a story about a miscarriage (even a mawkish fictional one) and turn it into a joke, you likely haven’t spent much time online. Buckley knew that readers would have a strong reaction to the piece, and alongside “Loss” he published a preemptive blog post. In it, he explained that he had planned out this narrative development years in advance. He also cited personal experience: an unplanned pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage that broke him out of a “toxic” relationship that he had been in in college. He drew on that experience for the comic.
For the most part, the internet didn’t care. The edits began immediately. On 4chan’s video-games board, /v/, moderators started to ban people who started new threads with them. Even Buckley seemed reluctant to commit to the seriousness of the subject matter. Assuring worried readers that he would not be turning the comic into a drama, he told them: “Nothing dictates that I now need to follow Ethan and Lilah through every second of their sad emotions, putting us right in the middle of it where, yes, it would be a bit depressing.” He weighed the idea of returning to Ethan and Lilah “post-ground-zero, when the pain isn’t so fresh, to show how they handle it.”
If that sounds like hedging, Buckley now admits that it could be. “I think maybe I went into the story line with solid intentions, and solid idea of where I wanted to take it,” he told me, “but perhaps didn’t commit as thoroughly as I should have in practice.” He also notes that, in retrospect, the strong reactions to the piece, supportive or critical, “may have also ended up tempering the final product more than originally intended.”
The other criticism leveled at the strip is that it suffers from a comic-book trope known as “fridging,” in which an author traumatizes a female character in order to spur character development in their male partner. Buckley says that he told the story from Ethan’s viewpoint because that was the only reference he had. “I think I was both afraid of miscalculating a woman’s perspective on that particular subject,” he recalled, “and not confident enough in my dramatic writing abilities to do it justice.” He said that if the situation were to come up again today, he would do more research into how miscarriage affects expectant mothers.
In 2008, web-comic artist Tim Buckley sat down to write a dramatic four-panel strip for his long-running comic "Ctrl+Alt+Del." What he ended up creating was loss.jpg, the web’s best-known and longest-running meme about a miscarriage.
Despite all of these shenanigans, Buckley said that he doesn’t regret having published the comic. He recalled experiences at conventions where females readers said that the story line had helped them. “Miscarriages aren’t something that typically receive a lot of open discussion, and it can be a very isolating experience,” he explained. “And that was really powerful to hear, this idea that no matter what else came out of that story line, there were people it resonated with on a very personal level.”
As for the memes? Buckley’s reaction to them has varied over the years, from anger “because perhaps I had miscalculated my demographic’s ability/willingness to approach such a sensitive subject matter” to frustration for “CAD” being pigeonholed as wacky gamer comic. And on very rare occasions, “As much as I hate to admit it because I certainly don’t want to make light of the subject matter itself, I found them quite amusing.” Now he says that he’s flattered that something he made has been entertaining people for more than seven years.
Why “Loss” has stuck around all these years is not entirely clear. Even the greatest scholars of memes struggle to understand why one particular image or idea circulates and another doesn’t. “Loss” is particularly interesting because it’s difficult to imagine a meme about miscarriage, created from gamer-centric media, becoming popular in 2015. Buckley thinks the meme has taken on a life of its own, divorced from its original context: “Most likely they’re just doing it to have fun, and I certainly wouldn’t suggest that it should stop if they still find amusement in it.”
It’s possible that most “Loss” edits are all in good fun, but that doesn’t change the fact that there is something very odd — probably even wrong — about finding amusement in intimate tragedy. But the gap between intention and effect is an eternal wellspring for humor online, and Buckley’s attempts to reach the heights of pathos with the limited tool set at his disposal revealed a very wide gulf. It wasn’t just that a joke about a miscarriage was an easy way for 4chan’s gleeful meme artists to shock people — it was that the strip was so stilted and unaffecting that no one seemed to be able to take it seriously enough to be shocked.
Memes are frameworks; they’re skeletons. They often contain jokes, but they are not, in and of themselves, funny. They provide a template onto which an infinite number of punch lines and observations can be written. Their uniformity makes them appealing, because they inherently give preference to those who are in the know; those who can identify the meme when others cannot. You have to know about the aforementioned history of “Loss” in order to get the joke. If you don’t, the remixes make little or no sense. In short, “Loss” only has the potential to be funny if you know that it is a callback to expectant parents losing their unborn child.
Eventually, people — mostly residents of 4chan’s /v/ video-game section — moved on from remixing Loss.jpg and started re-creating it in minimalist or abstract form. Its four-panel layout reveals a formula of sorts when broken down to its basic elements. Panel one: a straight vertical line. Panel two: two straight vertical lines, the one on the right slightly lower than the one on the left. Panel three: two even vertical lines. Panel four: a vertical line and a horizontal line.
It’s minimalism as comedy. Using this simple recipe, Loss.jpg turned into a sort of test: If you looked at an image and were able to see the comic strip hidden inside, then you were part of an exclusive club (of people who spend too much time online and are laughing about, indirectly at least, a miscarriage).
“I’m not sure what I anticipated, to be honest. I knew it was going to cause some ripples, and it was going to be a busy email day, but honestly by the time that specific comic went live, it was a decision that I had been living with for over a year,” Buckley told me when when I asked him about it this week.
“Loss” is a 4-panel comic strip, completely without dialogue. In the first panel, series protagonist Ethan bursts through the doors of an emergency room. In the second, he worriedly talks to a receptionist, who points him in a certain direction. The third panel shows Ethan conversing with a doctor who is clearly conveying bad news. In the fourth, Ethan stands over his crying fiancée, Lilah, who lies on her side in a hospital bed.
Even if you have never seen the original comic, and wouldn’t recognize the reference, you have likely come across one of its many memetic descendants online. It has been transformed into riffs on The Three Stooges, “Spy Vs. Spy,” a tragic episode of Futurama, and Pokémon. Originally bandied about as the ne plus ultra of stilted web-comic mawkishness, it has since become a meme in its own right — a visual framework atop which message boarders and bloggers can rework references and jokes. Seven years after Buckley attempted to dramatize the lives of his comic characters, members of 4chan’s /v/ board and Tumblr users are using Lilah’s miscarriage as a source of comedy.
To understand where loss.jpg comes from, you need to understand “Ctrl+Alt+Del” (henceforth referred to as “CAD”). Gaming web comics hit their stride in the mid-2000s with “Penny Arcade,” a strip that centers on two misanthropic hard-core gamers. It was followed, unsurprisingly, by other web comics about misanthropic hard-core gamers, including “CAD.” It was a perfect marriage of content and distribution: easily shareable comic strips for gamers, distributed on a medium where they were early adopters. The subgenre was so pervasive that blogs like Joystiq and Kotaku began running weekly roundups.
If “Penny Arcade” represented the high-water mark of the genre (a more-than-debatable assertion) then “CAD” represented the dozens of lesser imitators. “CAD,” like “Penny Arcade,” follows a small cast of main characters — Ethan, Lucas, Lilah, and Zeke (a humanoid robot made from an Xbox) — as they sit on the couch and joke about video games. It alternated between multi-strip story arcs and one-off gags.
While “CAD” has a large fan base, it has a lot of vocal detractors as well. Critics of “CAD” like to point out the laziness of Tim Buckley’s art style. His characters are rarely expressive, their eyelids all droop and their jaws are all slack. Analysis on the Bad Webcomics Wiki points out that many character expressions are composed of pre-drawn assets, the way you might construct a Bitmoji.
By now, you probably know that the $20 bill is getting a momentous and much-overdue redesign, with Harriet Tubman replacing Andrew Jackson on the front of the bill. It’s a historic and important change — but there are many unanswered questions, chief among them: “What does the new bill look like, and can I use it to make elaborate YouTube videos perpetuating 9/11 conspiracy theories?”
On the internet, 9/11 conspiracies are so prevalent that they’ve become a meme unto themselves. Phrases like “Bush did 9/11” and “Jet fuel can’t melt steel beams” get traded around every day, mostly ironically but occasionally not. YouTube documentaries like Loose Change fan the flames for true believers.
My favorite (or, not “my favorite,” “the most fascinating,” I guess?) 9/11 conspiracy theory has to do with the $20 bill, and anyone who entered a school cafeteria between 2002 and 2006 probably knows it. As a popular version of the theory goes, in 1996, the federal government revised U.S. currency to hint at the impending attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. By folding the bills in certain ways, one can reveal secret imagery that resembles the Twin Towers billowing smoke and collapsing.
At the same time, on the $20 bill, making accordion folds in certain locations allows woke currency handlers to spell out “Osama,” clearly a reference to al-Qaeda head Osama bin Laden.
This video spells it out pretty clearly.
Will the new $20, $10, and $5 bills contain further proof that 9/11 was an inside job, and that the Treasury Department knew in advance? We’ll have to wait and see.
Bill has spread to other locales and languages as well. In Arabic, he’s Bilal; in Malaysia, he’s Rashid; in Spanish, he’s Jose. There is also a female equivalent named Emily.
Of course, the backlash against Bill has already begun.
A page called Don’t Be Like Bill or Emily has cropped up, calling out Bill on his bullshit (“Billshit”?).
Consider: Don’t be like Bashar.
Translation, via Vocativ: “This is Bashar! Bashar heard that there were peaceful protests asking for freedom.. Bashar answered with oppression and live ammunition!! Bashar is a murderer.. Don’t be like Bashar.”
Good advice!
Throughout the past month or so, a simple man by the name of Bill has been dispensing etiquette tips on Facebook, either affirming or angering. Memes feature Bill, in his signature knitted hat, offering advice that should be obvious to most people with a pulse. It’s like Goofus & Gallant for the digital age, only the art is not as good and Goofus is dead, so we’re just stuck with boring, preachy Gallant.
If you haven’t seen any Bill memes on Facebook, you’re lucky. As of Tuesday morning, more than 1.3 million people have liked the main Be Like Bill page on Facebook.
Here’s a typical Be Like Bill meme:
In many ways, Bill is a perfect storm of the modern memescape. He’s got a rudimentary art style that’s simple to replicate, and he embodies the scolding, holier-than-thou behavior endemic to social media.
Which is why Bill sucks. Bill represents social media’s worst impulse: the claim to moral superiority wrapped in nagging, passive-aggressive complaint. Bill is every subtweet, every behavior-policing Facebook status update, every smug and condescending comment, illustrated exactly as crudely as the sentiment deserves.
Who needs to see this? What person might be convinced to amend his behavior by a primitively drawn, crudely articulated cartoon? No one, obviously. As is so often the case, the Bill meme isn’t really for anyone except the person sharing the Bill meme. It’s a way to give voice to the vague sense of irritation that generates so much social-media content and, at the same time, signal your own behavioral excellence.
The Bill Facebook page, it may not surprise you to learn, is the product of a self-described “internet entrepreneur,” Eugeniu Croitoru, and a colleague, Debabrata Nath. Croitoru told the BBC that the character “can be anyone who is smart and has common sense and doesn’t do annoying things.” You know, annoying things, like scolding people on social media.
A lot of other messages also feature guns and camouflage. The sometimes-spoken sentiment is that Obama and the Dumbocrats might not be willing to shoot, but these brave Second Amendment proponents will.
Really, though, most of these videos look like any vloggers’ videos. The key component of an ISIS callout is a dude, sitting in front of his webcam, shouting platitudes at nobody in particular. If ISIS has received these messages, they haven’t responded directly.
For the camera-shy, Twitter is the next best thing. ISIS and its supporters maintain thousands of Twitter accounts. Rather that tweet directly at any of them, however, many prefer to just yell “hey, ISIS” into the void.
As world governments mull strategies in their quests to stop the Islamic State, many people at home are wondering, “What can I do to stop ISIS?” The answer for many: Record a video calling them out.
It’s no secret that ISIS has a vast and effective social-media operation, so one way to combat ISIS from the safety of your computer is to taunt them on social media. Last week, a woman named Emily Longworth took to Facebook, calling out the Islamic State in a five-minute-long statement. It’s gone crazy viral, shared on Facebook nearly a quarter of a million times.
It’s a blustery defense of America, complete with long-winded metaphors: “My country is ready to release the chains of moral ambiguity that have suppressed our ability to defend our nation against all enemies sworn to destroy here.” “You are not indestructible from the shrapnel of our honor and liberty just because your god says you are.”
It ends with Longworth reciting a very strong quote from her father: “ISIS members, every one of you is a pig-eating son of a whore. Fuck you, your mother, your faggot prophet, and that offspring of a pig you call Allah. Am I being too vague?”
But Longworth’s message is just the latest in a well-worn genre of social-media post: the message to ISIS. For about a year and a half, YouTube and Twitter have been slowly accruing a large cache of threats and promises aimed at the terrorist organization.
What makes for a good ISIS callout video? Flags feature heavily in messages to ISIS. The American flag is either being celebrated, or, just as often, the ISIS flag is being destroyed in some manner.
In 2013, twitterers mocked Dawkins for complaining that London Heathrow Airport security had confiscated a small pot of honey from him. Rather than ignore them, Dawkins rewarded them with his time and attention, devoting an entire Guardian column to bemoaning their “puerile display of sniggering frivolity.”
The honey incident is still a very good joke to this day:
It’s fortunate that Dawkins doesn’t waste his time and effort on silly things like religion, and instead directs them to productive, non-delusional avenues like Twitter, where he’s made such great progress resolving the conflicts that plague all of humanity. If Dawkins didn’t exist, it would be necessary to invent him.
Richard Dawkins, a respected scientist and atheist, was at one time best known for coining the term meme and writing an entire book about how God is a made-up story for crazy people. Currently, he is best-known online as a popular microblogger and clock expert on the website twitter.com, and the owner of what may be the world’s thinnest skin. That fine, nearly translucent integument was on display again Monday, when Dawkins got trolled hard. Some might ask: Is a burn on Richard Dawkins really news? To which we answer: Uh, no, not really. But this is an exceptional burn.
Even though Dawkins opened himself up to needling by making his pet peeve public at book length in The God Delusion, he will occasionally carry on hopeless arguments with internet trolls, assuming they take him as seriously as he takes himself. Over the past few years, writer Virgil Texas has attempted to get Dawkins’s goat, periodically tweeting “God is real” at him, but Dawkins failed to rise to the bait — and, at some point, apparently blocked Texas.
But months after it seemed like Texas had given up, he made an end run around Dawkins’s block list Monday, asking followers to please tell Dawkins to unblock him because he had a very important message to share.
Unbelievably, crazy uncle Rick obliged, curious as to what valuable message a longtime troll might impart to him. I’d wager you can already see the punch line coming, even though Dawkins couldn’t.
Yep. “God is real.”
Perfect. Was it immature of Texas to keep poking at Dawkins over a period of years? Sure, but Dawkins didn’t have to respond; he had nothing to gain but humiliation. But Dawkins has proven time and again that he’s incapable of ignoring those who’d see him riled up.
The release of The Force Awakens has opened the door for all kinds of Star Wars fan theories — especially those about the origins of new characters Rey and Finn — but the best, craziest internet fan theory about Star Wars concerns an old favorite: Luke Skywalker. The “Bigger Luke” hypothesis posits that there were two Luke Skywalkers in the original trilogy: Regular Luke and Bigger Luke, who is about an inch taller.
There’s an entire wiki devoted to scanning the films for appearances of Bigger Luke and determining whether he’s a separate character within the Star Wars universe or just a larger Mark Hamill look-alike. Bigger Luke theorists dismiss the explanation that some scenes were just shot to make Hamill look taller next to Harrison Ford. I mean, that’s just silly.
Much of the “evidence” for Bigger Luke comes from screen-grabs of Hamill standing next to Harrison Ford, with their height difference mysteriously shifting from scene to scene. Remember, this has nothing to do with inconsistent camera angles and everything to do with there actually being two different Lukes.
Bigger Luke theorists also find textual evidence for their hypothesis in the films themselves: What else could Obi Wan’s declaration that “this is your first step into a larger world” mean? And what could “Aren’t you a little short for a Stormtrooper?” be but an inside joke about the two Lukes? It’s so obvious once you see it.
And, inevitably, there are also competing advocates for a Smaller Luke theory — they believe that the larger Luke is the real one and that the double is actually smaller than the original.
Mark Hamill has officially stayed mum on Bigger Luke, ignoring questions about it on Twitter, but he did say this about his role in the upcoming Star Wars VIII:
Trying to tell us something, Mark?
And that’s just scratching the surface of what’s going on at Tumblr’s Super Mario 64 tag right now. This meme is extremely deep, especially once you realize that Pannenkoek2012 has an entire playlist of similarly obsessive Mario glitch videos. He’s the John Nash of Nintendo 64, and these are his “crazy walls.”
Even if you don’t care about video games or the online “speedrun” culture that’s dedicated to finding glitches to beat them in faster and more interesting ways, you have to watch this Super Mario 64 video that’s blowing minds on Tumblr today. It’s 24 minutes devoted to collecting a single star in the game without pressing the jump button, and it’s so detailed that you have to respect it as a kind of art.
The trick, as explained by singularly obsessive glitch-hunter Pannenkoek2012, is to have Mario build speed by running in place at a specific spot for 12 hours (12 hours!) until he’s moving so fast that he can enter a series of parallel universes, then return to the original universe, bounce on an enemy you’ve glitched into the sky, and collect the star.
It’s breathtaking in its obsession and mastery of the game. Pannenkoek has calculated the slopes of individual floor triangles, and abused every rule about how walls work to keep Mario inside the bounds of a level.
Oh, and he did the whole thing with only “half” a press of the A button, which means he started the level with the button held down, and never pressed it again.
The “half ‘A’ press” video has driven Tumblr users totally insane, and they’ve been posting meme images and video tributes to its brain-breaking genius:
It’s long been established that it doesn’t matter what kind of horrible trash comes out of people’s landfill mouths, as long as it comes out in a British accent. We colonials are suckers for the pleasant speech patterns of our stamp-taxing former overlords. Even the words of Donald Trump are more sonorous when you replace his native New York City accent with something on the Rickman-Cumberbatch spectrum.
Sophisticated Trump is a good joke about style over substance by Peter Serafinowicz, prolific British comedian and character actor. Especially amusing because Serafinowicz has Britished up many characters in his work as a voice actor.
Trump should really hire someone to dub his speeches in a more posh accent, though. Any crazy thing he says sounds 50 percent more believable in the Queen’s English. Money may not buy class, but it can probably buy a vocal illusion that will get the job done.
At the Mobile World Congress last month, tech company Ericsson released a new report claiming that delays in loading web pages and videos lead to notable increases in stress levels. As if you didn’t already know that.
The study, which specifically looked at using the web while under time constraints, showed that, “On average, single delays resulted in a 38 percent increase in heart rate.” When video re-buffered — which it always does, right before the funny part you’re showing your friends — stress levels (evaluated at a pre-task baseline) rose from 19 percent to 34 percent.
From the study: A medium delay of 2 seconds when loading videos led average stress levels to go from 13 percent to 16 percent above the baseline. Once a video started to stream, a pause due to re-buffering caused stress levels to further increase by 15 percentage points. With high time-to-content delays of 6 seconds, half of the participants exhibited a 19 percent increase relative to baseline levels while the other half exhibited signs of resignation — their eye movements indicated distraction and stress levels dropped.
Researchers said that the type of stress response that we experience with slow loading was comparable to a horror movie or solving a math problem. So if you spend hours online, congratulations, your body is experiencing the stress of a horror movie all day, every day.
In a series of messages, Klairvoyant explained to me why she set out to dupe a bunch of law nerds. (Klairvoyant describes herself as an 18-year-old student at an Ivy League college, but declined to offer any concrete proof of her identity — though she did post what she says are her ACT scores.)
A scheme this strange had to start in an appropriately strange portion of the internet: the “pro-ana” subculture, where people with anorexia and other eating disorders openly exchange tips about cultivating their disorders. Feuding with the moderator of the prominent eating-disorders subreddits, Klairvoyant, who claims to be anorexic herself, launched her own. Somehow, she says, she decided the best way to promote it would be by making up eating-disorder stories on legaladvice, and linking back to her own page.
(Like anything an admitted troll says, this story should be taken with a grain of salt, but if Klairvoyant is also lying about having an eating disorder, it’s a committed lie: She’s been a frequent, multiple-times-a-day poster to various pro-eating-disorder subreddits for nearly a year.)
The mention of eating disorders reminded me of one of legaladvice’s most poignant questions: A prisoner headed to jail who wanted to know whether she could refuse to wake up before noon and avoid foods whose components can’t be separated (i.e., salad with dressing on it). Naturally, like anything worth reading on legaladvice, it turns out that Klairvoyant had made it up. She pulled the insistence on separated foods from an eating condition from her own childhood.
Even after she felt done promoting her eating-disorders subreddit, Klairvoyant says she started making up r/legaladvice stories for fun. A user suing over tainted ketamine came to her from an episode of Criminal Minds. Several Reddit users accused Klairvoyant’s drug-user front account of making the story up. When she got in an argument over brain lesions from ketamine abuse, though, readers decided that only a ketamine user could know about the lesion. “This just goes to show that people see what they want to see,” she says.
But, after her GPA dropping, Klairvoyant has decided to stop terrorizing r/legaladvice. “I’ve realized that trolling Reddit is a massive waste of time,” she says. Those of us who still just want to waste ours reading r/legaladvice will have to stick with the posts Klairvoyant hasn’t claimed, like the woman whose neighbors keep painting her house, or the guy banned from his local Smash Brothers tournament — assuming those aren’t fakes, too.
If you’ve visited r/legaladvice — a popular Reddit board devoted to, yes, legal advice — over the last few months, here are some of the people you might have encountered: a guy who lifted a bad batch of ketamine and wants to know if he could sue the veterinarian he stole it from after it made him sick; a troubled teenager panicking as his school shuts down his fake-ID operation; a kid who nearly blew his hands off with illegal fireworks and wants advice on how he could hide from the cops; and a convicted street racer who violated his probation by racing and doesn’t get why a judge might be mad.
These posters represent the typical mix of brazen criminality and abject stupidity that’s made r/legaladvice the Reddit trainwreck of choice for Twitter, Tumblr, and bloggers. They’re also all fake. All four people, and a handful of others, were all the creations of one person: “Klairvoyant,” a troll who claims to be an “anorexic Ivy leaguer” who’s fabricated a number of elaborate stories for r/legaladvice. Why? Well, uh, in order to draw attention — she says — to a breakaway pro-eating-disorder subreddit. More on that in a minute.
In theory, r/legaladvice should be boring. And in practice it often is. In an effort to keep out amateur legal experts and sovereign-citizen types, posters with actual legal knowledge are starred. As with so much else on Reddit, the key here is the way you sort the front page. Reading the subreddit sorted by “hot” topics (the default) is as exciting as spending the day in your local county clerk’s office. It’s a web page full of disputed wills, trees leaning over property lines, and capricious bosses. But if you sort by “controversial” — i.e., threads that have a near equal number of positive and negative votes — you can get past the subreddit’s county courthouse and into legaladvice’s equivalent of a strip-club parking lot, where desperate people try to recover from their previous schemes with even worse ones.
This r/legaladvice, the how-do-I-dispose-of-a-body legaladvice, is the one that made the subreddit one of the most popular among Reddit’s legions of haters and voyeurs, earning it 80,000 subscribers, and making it one of the top 100 most active subreddits. The trademark combination of bravado and hopelessness turned legaladvice’s most deluded posters into legends on Twitter and Tumblr, and supported an entire other subreddit, r/bestoflegaladvice, devoted to its most outrageous posts.
But as legends often are, many were too good to be true. On Monday, a poster called Klairvoyant took to bestoflegaladvice to admit to faking a dozen of the “requests” for legal advice: “Since it’s 2016, I’ve decided to stop trolling Reddit and become an adult,” she wrote.
Nearly all of the most notable recent r/legaladvice posts, Klairvoyant admitted, were fake. She then posted confirmation from the accounts of each the characters she’d created. For fans of the ongoing r/legaladvice pileup, it was a stunner. A post about Klairvoyant’s confession on SubredditDrama, the traditional end of the human centipede when it comes to meta-Reddit news, shot to the top of the subreddit. One user noted that her posts amounted to “like half the subreddit.”
“Fuck you, you piece of shit,” wrote another.
It can’t have come as much of a surprise. Given how many of the best r/legaladvice threads can read like a film-school draft, commenters regularly accuse the most sensational stories of being trolls. But it still stung: While her readers thought they were getting a glimpse of ketamine-fueled crime, Klairvoyant explained, they were actually a thrilling invention of a bored Reddit user with too much time on her hands. The street racer, the kids with the IDs and fireworks — she’d made them all up.
Well, that certainly took a quick turn from harmless fun and a BBC1 appearance and headed directly for creeptown.
And Alice is certainly not alone. The internet’s celebrity foot-fetish community is large, and it is dedicated. It’s a well-known and somewhat strange fact that the top Google auto-complete for nearly every female celebrity’s name is “feet.”
An English college student who wrote an article about life with webbed toes was surprised to discover, a year after the fact, that one of the top Google results for her name was a foot-fetish website. Someone at wikiFeet, a compendium of celebrity foot pics, had apparently put together an entry for Cachia, a non-celebrity, with every photo of her toes that she’d shared online. “Really fucking weird,” she wrote, understating the situation a little bit.
But Cachia wasn’t as offended that she’d been involuntarily thrust into the world of celebrity feet as she was that the user reviews of her toes were only “ok.”
“Quickly, my feelings of vulnerability turned to anger as I noticed my toes had only been rated 2.5 stars out of a possible five,” she wrote, captioning a photo of her mediocre rating, “are you fucking serious?”
”Just because I don’t have five clearly separate toes, it doesn’t give people the right to devalue them.”
Her life hasn’t changed dramatically since her feet “went viral” in the U.K. media about a week ago, although she has gotten around 70 Facebook friend requests (many from “creepy middle-aged men”) and her housemates now tease her because “MEN WANK OVER ALICES WEBBED TOES.”
There’s also the small matter of a new photo that appeared on her wikiFeet entry since she became semi-famous.
“Now I’m getting freaked out because someone has uploaded a picture of my leg with a large bruise on it,” she wrote. “It’s definitely my leg because it’s my bed, but I have no idea when I took that picture, nor who I sent it to, and I don’t like the fact that someone decided to upload it to the website.”
Jeff Bezos has had many bold ideas: selling books over the internet, funding experimental private space-travel, making a phone whose only function was to … buy things on Amazon. But perhaps none of his endeavors have been as risky as his so-far successful attempt at reviving an aging print-media institution — the Washington Post, which he bought in 2013 for $250 million. His secret weapon? He’s not afraid to use forum tactics from the ‘90s web.
Bezos isn’t afraid to think outside the box. A new profile for Fortune demonstrates how Bezos doesn’t let practicality stand in the way of a good idea.
(It’s not just Bezos that calls it “disemvoweling”: The tactic is an ancient-by-web-standards method to deal with trolls, spammers, and other unwanted posts with some degree of transparency. On many forums, certain words would be automatically disemvoweled, or particularly trolly posts would be disemvoweled by forum moderators. For years, early blogs like BoingBoing and Gawker have used disemvoweling to get rid of annoying and menacing commenters.)
Allowing users to pay to alter a news organization’s content, even in silly ways, is — as already noted — a very bad idea. But maybe Bezos is on to something here. Disemvoweling is just one of the many punishment methods that web forums have come up with to deter bad users. Could they also be applied to major publications?
There is the simple ban. Maybe readers could pay a newspaper to ban (a.k.a. “fire”) a writer that they don’t … wait, now that I’m thinking about it, that’s an even worse idea. Instead of an all-out ban, maybe readers could block or mute authors and topics that they don’t like. Sites could charge a premium, allowing users to set up a kill file.
Maybe readers could pay to set up a posting interval. Let’s say, hypothetically, that you don’t like WaPo op-ed contributor Richard Cohen. The company could charge a fee that limits the frequency with which Cohen can shitpost (web slang for, I mean, you know what that means) — one column every two months, or something. The more you pay, the more that span increases.
In my opinion, though, the best forum-method to bring to newspapers would be the hell-ban, one of the most devious tactics ever deployed on the web. Hell-banning (also known as shadow-banning) hides all of a user’s posts, but doesn’t stop them from posting. The idea is that he or she will just assume that they are being ignored and leave of their own accord. Imagine if you could hell-ban — say — just picking a name at random here — David Brooks of the New York Times, not just for yourself, but for every single reader. Brooks might continue, for years, to file columns that nobody reads; nobody talks about his work; he writes into oblivion. I, a millennial in his prime, would pay $6.99 a month for that.
2. Once you’re looking at the source, press Control + F (Command + F on a Mac) and enter “jpg.” You should jump to the URL of the photo. (It’ll be on the line labeled “meta property=”og:image.”)
3. Copy the image URL, which will look something like “https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/12543378_462202900640684_662391546_n.jpg,” and paste it into your URL bar.
4. Add .html or .txt to the URL and reload to get your ASCII pic!
Happy text-arting!
Instagram has a hidden feature that will show you an ASCII-art version of any photo, rendering it as colored text instead of an image file. What is it good for? Nothing, really. Maybe saving bandwidth? Who knows! What matters is that you can now view Kim Kardashian’s many, many selfies in glorious ASCII vision.
The trick is very simple: just add “.html” after the “.jpg” at the end of any image file on Instagram to see the color ASCII version (or add “.txt” to see the black-and-white one).
The absolute easiest way to do it is to drag this bookmarklet (created by Following’s Brian Feldman) to your bookmarks bar:
InstaASCII
Open up any Instagram photo page and click the bookmarklet to get the ASCII version of the photo.
You can also do it the hard way — though the only tough part is finding the URL of an Instagram pic in the first place. The quickest way to do it has four steps:
1. Right-click on the photo page and select “view source.”
When feminists argue that feminism helps men, too, helping men get laid on Tinder is probably not what they have in mind. But here were are, with 2016 looming, and dating apps are full of so many self-proclaimed feminist bros that a comedian has started collecting their profiles on a brilliant Tumblr called Male Feminists of Tinder
Comedian and Cosmopolitan.com editor Lane Moore’s new project is a perfect snapshot of a particular, awkward moment in culture and technology. Now that social media is ubiquitous, men can no longer ignore women’s voices or remain entirely oblivious to feminism. But what some men seem to take away from that exposure is: Chicks dig feminism, and maybe I can use that to get a hookup?
There’s nothing wrong with a male feminist in theory, but in practice many seem primarily concerned with broadcasting their status as Good Guys — as a sales pitch on a hookup-centric dating app, even.
Male Feminists of Tinder is still in its infancy, but in its first five entries it’s already captured a wide range of the internet’s fem-bro megafauna, from the very casual to the “ask me about my comics and my female paraplegic protagonist.”
That last guy is just looking for some “you-know-what in the you-know-where,” by the way, so don’t swipe right if you’re just going to waste his time.
The future is truly amazing. There’s something for everyone.
Facebook’s long-term goal as a company is to move from enabling communication through a layer of software on computers and phones to enabling global interconnectivity on a physical, infrastructural level, using drones and satellites and lasers — and the oft-maligned “Free Basics” program. The company isn’t messing around here. Zuckerberg said that its internet-beaming drone can fly around providing service for months.
Facebook engineers are heavily focused on building out the company’s machine learning and AI features, both to expand Facebook’s overall capabilities and to reduce some of the development load for anyone using the platform. To help build out those features, Facebook is opening up those platforms to developers.
It’s a symbiotic relationship in which developers get to harness the power of Facebook’s robust AI tools while also feeding the AI project more data to make it better. In the short term, these advances will feed back into Facebook’s bot platform, helping it better understand and respond to users. In the long term … it will probably figure how to launch the nukes.
You might notice that nowhere on that graph is the News Feed — the product most people think of when they hear the word Facebook. That’s not to say that News Feed is going away any time soon — it still makes Facebook more money than anything else — but the company is clearly looking beyond the Feed, an increasingly antiquated format in an age when young people spend most of their time in Snapchat and messaging apps.
Virtual and augmented reality are here to stay.
Facebook is already shipping its Oculus virtual-reality headsets to consumers, and though there’s still a relatively high barrier to entry (the kit costs $600), the company seems committed to lower it. Zuckerberg, in full Oprah mode, gave every keynote attendee a Samsung Gear VR headset, which uses Oculus tech as well, and the company also said it was working on augmented reality glasses, but didn’t have anything concrete to show off.
In addition to obvious gaming capabilities, Zuckerberg clearly sees VR as another immersive communication tool: “I think virtual reality has the potential to be the most social platform,” Zuckerberg said, showing off a demo of two avatars interacting together in 3-D space, despite being in physical distant locations. Of course, there needs to be a revenue component, so maybe soon you’ll be able to have an “interactive brand experience” where you and your friend in Kuala Lumpur can talk in VR space but only about Pizza Hut.
For now, though, this is still the face of VR:
This week in California, Facebook is hosting its annual F8 developer conference, where it announces all of the ambitious technology and initiatives that will change how you experience the web. That sounds hyperbolic, but it’s not: If there’s been a running theme at F8 for the past few years, it has been Facebook flexing just how powerful it is. This year, Mark Zuckerberg literally picked up a carbon-fiber drone engine and carried it across the stage. Here’s a rundown.
Live video is here, duh.
If you have Facebook on your phone, you likely know from its irritating alerts that Facebook is making a big push into live video. Today it announced a Live API, which would allow third-party hardware and software to be integrated into broadcasts. No longer will broadcasting be relegated to Facebook’s app, meaning users can take advantage of nicer cameras than that on an iPhone — and, crucially, third-party editing software to add overlays, animations, and other effects. It’s time to welcome the glorious era of inescapable and hideously ugly videos that we predicted last month!
Secondly, the company also took the wrapping paper off its many-eyed 360-degree camera and is open-sourcing its design. Expect to see numerous high-end and cheapo versions of it in the coming months.
A new way to log in.
Facebook also unveiled a new developer platform called Account Kit. The idea is simple: Rather than registering a username and password, log-in only requires an email address or phone number. Then a onetime-use code is sent to that device. It’s very simple to use, and in most ways it’s more secure than a password, but there’s a nightmare downside: If someone loses their mobile device, it could lead to an authentication headache and never-ending chain of two-factor authentication.
Zuckerberg has clearly been getting swoll.
This has gradually become apparent over his last few public appearances, but Zuckerberg has clearly been working out. If you’re going to become a Cyberlord of Earth, you gotta be buff.
Messaging is gigantic …
Between its two messaging platforms, Messenger and WhatsApp, Facebook is processing 60 billion messages per day, triple the number of standard SMS messages. Separating Messenger into its own app — an aggressive strategy that was initially off-putting to many users — appears to have worked out. Messenger was the company’s fastest-growing platform in the past year and now handles 900 million users every day.
… so there’s a messaging-development platform now.
Developers are now able to implement bots so that users can interact with their web presence simply by talking to them. This is poised to become the next big thing in tech, as much as a delineated tech industry even exists anymore. The two examples Zuckerberg showed off were bots from CNN and 1-800-Flowers, demonstrating the platforms’ two strengths: curated information, and commerce. CNN’s messages were tailored to a user’s specific interests, and 1-800-Flowers let users order flowers without calling.
Facebook is heavily encouraging developers to get with the program and start making their own chatbots (the better to increase Messenger’s ubiquity and popularity). If you want, you can even receive “sponsored messages” on occasion (you can also block them entirely). Like Microsoft, Facebook is pushing its own easy-to-use bot-creation tool and AI platforms.
Users can also integrate bots right into Messenger through a new bot store, similar to the App Store. And like the App “Store,” expect most bot integrations to be free. They do want to sell you stuff, after all.
Here’s Facebook’s global-domination plan for the next ten years.
There’s even precedent for police and prosecutors attempting to use emoji to convict someone of terrorist threats against police. The case against 17-year-old Brooklyn resident Osiris Aristy centered on a Facebook status that read, “Nigga run up on me, he gunna get blown down 👮🔫🔫🔫.” The charges were dropped after a grand jury decided not to indict him. Jeffrey Lane, an urban ethnographer and assistant professor at the School of Communication and Information at Rutgers University, said, “When I’ve seen teens in my research post emoji of a gun at a cop, it’s without intention or planning to shoot an officer but with deep hatred and frustration toward police following an arrest or prosecution of a close peer or peers. This is part of how teens and police in poor neighborhoods come to see each other.”
All of this has implications for Facebook’s reactions. At the moment, they’re treated exactly the same as a “like” — a binary, yes/no data point. But, as pointed out by Reveal, the point of the reactions is to gather more accurate data about our emotions, and Facebook has said they will begin providing this more detailed analysis of us to advertisers. And though Facebook’s law-enforcement guidelines say they only give information out to the government when it comes knocking with a warrant, law-enforcement agencies already do their own scraping of Facebook’s data, with or without a judge’s go-ahead — something Facebook has acknowledged in the past.
“Emoji are expressive, and just like speech, you could use emoji to express threats,” said the ACLU’s Rowland. “However, there is nothing illegal, ever, about expressing your like or love for something online. It never a crime to say that you like something, whether it be the KKK or ISIS. An emoticon itself is never going to constitute a criminal action.” A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment.
Facebook depends on increasingly sophisticated ad targeting to make money, so it’s unsurprising to learn that Facebook’s new "reactions" feature will benefit advertisers in a variety of ways. But what about that other social-media scanning, sentiment-analyzing monolith, American law enforcement? A recent item from Reveal News argues that Facebook reactions will give law enforcement “a column in a spreadsheet that corresponds to emotion…. With the six new icons, determining emotion and sentiment through Facebook could now be exponentially simpler.” We talked to some digital-privacy-rights experts to find out more.
Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said that while there’s no proof that analysis of Facebook reactions will provide any actual assistance to law enforcement in building a legitimate case against a suspect, the ACLU has “concerns about police attitude toward collecting and monitoring online speech. What’s most important is that because people don’t have a formal expectation of privacy on social media, when they’re answering a quiz or using a reaction, they’re adding more information for law enforcement and advertisers.”
Police monitoring of social media is at an all-time high. A 2014 LexisNexis survey of law-enforcement officers found that over 80 percent use social media in investigations, and that Facebook is the platform they monitor most, a full 26 percentage points more than the next-most-surveilled platform, YouTube.
There are already multiple cases in which police have used similar social-media actions to prosecute people who have turned out to be innocent. In 2011, then-19-year-old Jelani Henry was jailed for 19 months on Rikers Island because he matched the description of someone who had shot and killed two people in East Harlem — tall, light-skinned black male — and police had seen him in pictures with friends of his from the neighborhood, some of whom had been arrested for violent crimes and liked Facebook pages associated with his crew. “Because of them pictures, the DA said I was affiliated, that I know what’s going on in the hood,” he told the Verge in 2014. “Those are people I would call my friends, but what they was doing, I wasn’t doing. To her, I’m part of them. I’m a monster.”
His case was dropped in the 19th month of his imprisonment (nine of which were in solitary confinement) with no comment or apology from Cyrus Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, who, coincidentally, has recently said that he has some 175 locked iPhones he’d like Apple to unlock for him. Henry’s mother, Alethia, told the Verge, “People don’t understand why it’s so dangerous to put yourself out there on social media. You know what my son is guilty of? Being born on 129th Street.”
Additionally, multiple law enforcement and security forces, from Fresno, California, police to the Oregon Department of Justice to the Department of Homeland Security to Mall of America security guards, have been caught surveilling and, in some cases, targeting black activists over social media in recent months. These aren’t rogue organizations, this is top-down policy; a 2013 report from the Department of Justice’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services recommends heavy law-enforcement monitoring at all levels, as does a 2013 report from the International Association of Police Chiefs’ Center for Social Media, which concluded, bafflingly, that social-media policies for law-enforcement organizations should follow the exact “same principles” that are used when physically monitoring citizens. (The IACP’s Center for Social Media did not respond to a request for comment.)
Desmond Patton, an assistant professor at Columbia University’s School of Social Work and a data researcher who focuses on the intersection of social media, policing, and youth violence, said that the root of the issue comes down to law enforcement inaccurately interpreting the language young people of color use on social media. “The ways people are using these forms of communications are not widely understood,” he said. “They’re pretty clear on some patterns of communication online, but even young people in the same neighborhood are not sure what different emoji mean. For the police to be using it as a data point for criminalization is quite nerve-racking for me … The issue is how social-media platforms are determining what is criminal or violent or threatening. It’s important to think about racialization of communications. Things that appear uniquely ‘urban’ or black or Latino become the very things that are categorized as being criminal.”
On top of that, the feature apparently permanently muted any email thread, keeping new messages out of the inbox. This keeps within the spirit of a mic drop, but is terrible functionality.
The feature was introduced to users in a pop-up bubble when users first loaded up a new compose window. But it only appeared that once, meaning that if someone missed the notice about what the button actually did, they would never be notified again. On top of that, the iconography is not great. If I didn’t know what a mic drop was (and I’d wager that most Gmail users don’t) then I’d have no clue what this button means. But it also says “Send,” so people used it anyway.
Google quickly pulled the feature after user outcry, saying:
I guess that means that the Minions accomplished their job, sowing chaos and discord across cyberspace.
Anybody could have told you that Google’s email prank today was going to go wrong. How Google itself didn’t see it coming is kind of amazing and mind-boggling.
Let’s back up. Gmail’s prank seems pretty simple on the surface. The company introduced a Mic Drop button into Gmail, which added a GIF of a Minion to any email.
That’s fine. Cute, even. But the prank, as Google soon learned, made a lot of assumptions about user behavior, and as any designer or developer will tell you: Good design should assume that the user is an idiot.
The move turned disastrous after users interpreted the Mic Drop button to be the normal Send button; it was even placed right next to the normal button. Users, many of whom use email in a capacity other than sending funny GIFs to each other, accidentally sent a Minions GIF to unintended recipients.
Users complaining on Google’s support system allegedly lost jobs or job opportunities. One user wrote:
Are you a fan of live video? Do you love watching shaky footage of a relatively low-quality variety? Doesn’t matter; Facebook is about to show you more anyway.
Last fall, the company began to slowly roll out livestreaming functionality, letting celebrities and others with large followings broadcast what they were up to. Which brings us to today, when the service announced that it will start giving more attention to live video, separating it into a new category from uploaded video.
In addition, the news-feed algorithm — a black box of thousands of click signals meant to keep you engaged and sated with content — will prioritize streams that are currently live over archived versions.
What does this mean for you? Not a whole lot in the immediate sense, but it does signal that Facebook’s Sauronic eye is slowly inching toward the growing area, prioritizing its own service over competitors like Periscope, Twitch, YouTube, and … Meerkat?
Above all, however, this is likely an opening volley against Snapchat, whose extremely popular Story function (photos and videos that expire after 24 hours) is the social web’s current preferred way of demonstrating that “I’m having fun right now!!!!” Social media’s pull is highly reliant on FOMO, and within FOMO, there’s a clear hierarchy. Text updates are good, photos are better, video is best. People are more likely to spend more time engaged watching their friends/celebrity crushes having fun in real time, and the longer they stay engaged, the larger the window is to insert advertising into.
And here’s where it’s going to get interesting: New-media publishers like BuzzFeed, NowThis, Vox, and others have funneled a lot of money into video production over the last year or two largely because of Facebook’s increasing audience rewards for news-feed video. Their preproduced videos generally condense time (e.g., those insanely popular 15-second recipe videos) and work around Facebook’s muted autoplay by relying on textual overlay and closed captioning rather than audio narration. But … none of these tactics are possible with live video — meaning that while major publishers throw more muscle behind slickly produced professional video, livestreaming will appear antithetical. And most likely, they’ll appear side-by-side in your feed.
Mike Boyd, a photographer and YouTuber, describes himself as a dabbler in many things. A few months ago he decided to dabble in skateboarding, and challenged himself to go from no skating skills whatsoever to doing a kick-flip. It took him nearly six hours, and he documented the whole process in a video. It was hugely popular.
A lot of YouTube tutorials are posted by experts, and their skills are so advanced that absolute beginners get overwhelmed trying to copy them. Boyd had hit upon an untapped demand for another type of instructional video: one where the instructor himself is a beginner and his failures aren’t edited out to make the journey seem easier.
And that actually makes learning how to kick-flip seem possible and realistic to a total non-skater. You can watch Boyd go to the store, buy a cheap pink No Fear board, and fall off it for hours. You can celebrate with him when he finally reaches his goal (because watching a man struggle with a skateboard for six hours is an achievement, too).
This format resonated so strongly with viewers on YouTube and Reddit that they asked Boyd to record himself learning other new skills from scratch, and the most popular request was “learn how to unicycle.”
He did, in two and a half hours. The video went up on Wednesday.
A movie-length video of a man repeatedly falling off a unicycle doesn’t sound like it should be compelling viewing, but you’d be surprised. And in a year when people waited in line to watch Shia LaBeouf watch his own movies, what do you have to lose?
The just-released Fallout 4 is the latest open-world video game to take the gaming community by storm. And with the option to choose any path you wish through the game’s narrative also comes a kind of fandom where players explore odd corners of the game’s sandbox. Like, say, making extremely ugly avatars. These examples, collected by Kotaku, are unfortunate even for the game’s irradiated, post-apocalyptic hellscape.
Making a particularly ugly avatar seems like the natural outgrowth of torturing Sims or creating intentional death rides in Roller Coaster Tycoon. You’ve created this terrifying digital artifact, but now is it doomed to live out its eternal existence as a virtual Frankenstein?
“I think Facebook polls are the best way to communicate online,” said Tim Faust, the creator of “Was Al Gore Hot?” “They’re clunky, inconvenient, badly designed, difficult to use, and infrequently useful. Thus, perfect.”
Most examples of Weird Facebook are slightly less focused on subverting the actual software, and more focused on taking full advantage of it. Facebook now has dozens of pages that just post bizarro riffs on the site’s overcompressed and crudely watermarked detritus. Check Dis Shit Out and Laughapalooza, for instance, operate as deadpan parodies of the corny jokes and T-shirt-ready slogans that once seemed to fill the social network — though their creators would surely never admit it.
Weird Facebook has been around since at least 2014, when Daily Dot writer Jordan Pedersen identified and described the phenomenon as “a loose conglomeration of pages that post bizarre image macros. Fodder for the guy you bought weed from in high school.” It’s just that it’s become much bigger in the last year or so, and no one can really figure out why.
For their part, the people who run the pages that fall within the greater sphere of Facebook’s avant-garde mostly seem baffled by the sudden popularity of their creations. The most frequently offered explanation as to why the site has been such a successful platform for oddness lately, however, is that Facebook “is where everyone already is.”
“On the first day we created the event, we only invited a few close friends to it as a joke and then we left the event up for open invites,” said Alan Pham, the California high-school student who created “Listening to drake and crying.” “The next morning, I saw a couple thousand people put ‘interested’ or ‘going.’” In the end, 25,000 people would end up “attending” the event.
One possibility is that the much-theorized News Feed algorithm changes that have leveled traffic at digital publishers have benefited the small, weird groups that represent a more immediate connection to users’ interests than more generically viral stories and videos. Since Facebook is famously cagey about changes to its algorithm, it’s impossible to prove, but many users I talked to said the site has been noticeably quicker to incorporate changes in their interests since the beginning of last year. Personally, I almost never see the irksome political posts and ugly jokes of people who I’ve friended out of social obligation these days, only getting content from the pages I actively and enthusiastically follow — as selected by Facebook, naturally.
Another is that, for a variety of reasons, Facebook is the social network that’s currently best hitting the balance between freedom and accountability. An important difference between these Facebook pages and other online subcultures is their commitment to inclusivity. Websites like Reddit and Twitter are famous for commitments to free speech that often end up tolerating harassment, Facebook pages like “Useless, Unsuccessful, and/or Unpopular Memes” and “Cool Freaks Wikipedia Club” have what amounts to zero-tolerance policies regarding racist, sexist, and homophobic content.
“I think diversity in the meme world is happening more everywhere, but Facebook groups based around the loose family of Korn DMT have really started pushing diversity and addressing it openly,” said an administrator of the meme community “I play KORN to my DMT plants, smoke blunts all day & do sex stuff.” “People are sick of 13-year-old KKK members running the humor game lol.”
It’s hard to think of a social network less cool in the popular imagination than Facebook (other than maybe LinkedIn, the Web 2.0 equivalent of BonziBuddy). It’s the one your mom and dad and everyone you went to high school with are on, after all — the place where people who you’ve spent most of your life trying to avoid are ever-present with baby photos, bad videos, and racist opinions. Other than them, who would want to spend time on the internet’s blandest platform?
Where the anonymity offered by Twitter or 4chan might once have provided creative freedom for weirdos and memers, it now feels like a drawback. According to John Trulli, who runs the popular “Cabbage Cat” meme page, Facebook’s radical transparency makes the dynamic between creators and their audience far more intimate compared to other social networks. “These people see your whole life, and it’s more personal and they become loyal fans,” said Trulli. “On Instagram, people always complain when ‘meme pages’ post selfies, etc., so it’s not a personal experience.”
Recently, Twitter announced that it too would soon be adopting an algorithm to sort posts. If Twitter (or any other social network) really wanted to make their website as fun and creative as Facebook is now, a better feature to ape would be the tools that make it easy to form groups with like-minded people and make jerks accountable for their jerkiness. Until then, users could do a lot worse than friending ’em all and letting the bots sort ’em out.
Five Weird Facebook Pages
Useless, Unsuccessful, and/or Unpopular Memes
As the name suggests, this community is dedicated to sharing original but unfunny, overly obscure, or otherwise broken memes. This often takes the form of image macros based on deliberately tortured puns, but really any referential joke that’s more likely to make members groan than laugh is welcome.
Laughapalooza
A straight-faced parody of Grandma friendly humor pages, Laughapalooza takes the shit-pic to its logical conclusion, posting images that look like they were made in Kid Pix and read like bot-generated chain emails about Obama.
フレッドYOLO
The answer, it turns out, is thousands of the web’s most innovative weirdos. In the last year or so, dozens of intensely, specifically odd pages have sprung up on the social network, celebrating everything from furniture-themed memes to 1999’s biggest Latin rock hit featuring a member of Matchbox 20, churning out the inscrutable and stupid humor — the dank memes — that used to define places like Tumblr and 4chan. In the process, Facebook has transformed from the site where relatives post screenshots of chain emails to the one where some of the wildest, dumbest, funniest digital culture is being birthed. Welcome to Weird Facebook.
As a music genre, Vaporwave has largely disappeared from whatever small territory it held in the public consciousness, but as a video-games and VHS-inspired aesthetic, it’s still alive and well on Facebook. Freddy Yolo, like a number of similar users, shares pictures that seem to come from Vaporwave’s alternate, fever-dream version of 1999, always out of context and without commentary.
Nihilist Memes
While leftist and anti-capitalist politics dominate much of Weird Facebook, (ambiguously sincere) nihilism is an equally popular school of thought. Nihilist Memes is just that, using viral images to celebrate that nothing matters.
I play KORN to my DMT plants, smoke blunts all day & do sex stuff
I don’t know, man, it’s funny, lol.
If you’re not currently in Weird Facebook, you may be tangentially aware of it through Barnie Sandlers and Bernie Sanders’s Dank Meme Stash, two meme-humor-heavy pages created in support of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders that have been much-discussed by the mainstream press. But the Bernie Sanders meme community is just one, small, only slightly connected part of a more expansive, and much weirder, segment of Facebook.
In order to talk about Weird Facebook, I’m going to have to ruin it (sorry). To the uninitiated, the humor is often incomprehensibly self-referential and — like any good joke — trying to explain it is the easiest way to suck the fun right out. Take this recent popular image by the page Gangster Popeye, for instance. Why is it funny? It’s a riff on the meme “don’t talk to me or my son ever again” — which itself plays off of the inexplicable appeal of seeing a small thing next to a larger version of that thing. You might not laugh now, or ever, but I promise you it is indeed some very good shit.
“Weird Facebook” takes its name from “Weird Twitter,” the loose association of comedians, parodists, writers, and weirdos — mostly refugees from the influential message board Something Awful — whose dry, troll-y jokes have helped shape the culture of Twitter. “Weird” in this case refers both to the tone of the humor and the ways that the site is being used. The “Weird” version of any social network is the one in which its tools are pushed past the bounds of their intended purposes, usually for the purposes of inscrutable, self-referential humor.
Last fall, for instance, fictitious planned events like “Listening to drake and crying” and “Push moshing to korn” suddenly became popular, with thousands of people pledging to meet up at places like the “vacant lot behind the abandoned circle k.” Around the same time, a very public abuse of Facebook’s poll feature called “Was Al Gore Hot?” also took off. A winning faction of 3,713 users would eventually determine that we don’t think Al Gore was hot, but we “get it.”
When you can’t get to a page on the web, you get an error code instead. The most familiar is Error 404 — “Page Not Found” — but there’s a whole universe of obstacles that could stand between your browser and the page you want. And on Monday, the Internet Engineering Steering Group approved a new one: Error 451 — Unavailable for Legal Reasons.
The new code applies to pages that have fallen victim to government censorship, which has reportedly been on the rise globally for many years now. The number 451 wasn’t chosen at random: It’s a reference to Ray Bradbury’s crucial work of anti-censorship sci-fi Fahrenheit 451. Perfectly apt for a code that denotes the online equivalent of book-burning.
The IESG recommends that every 451 message include information about who denied access to the page and why, which is a step in the direction of transparency. But the organization also points out that there’s nothing to stop censorious government entities from getting around it:
“It is possible that certain legal authorities might wish to avoid transparency, and not only demand the restriction of access to certain resources, but also avoid disclosing that the demand was made.”
Bradbury passed away in 2012, and would likely not be comforted to know that we continue to live inside one of his novels.
I am a city-dwelling young person, so the idea of owning a home to me is not really dissimilar from the idea of owning an island, or owning a planet — only for rich, crazy people. I’m expected to stay in one place while I pay a bank run by unconvicted felons back some ludicrous amount of money for 40 years — and then what? Live there ‘til I die? Hmmm.
If a gun were held to my head right now, though, and I was forced to buy a home on the spot, I suppose I could do worse than this three-bedroom, two-floor home at 69 Cock Lane, which a horrible tabloid delightfully calls “the rudest address in Britain,” in Fetcham, Surrey, U.K., a town that Wikipedia says “has a mill pond, springs and an associated nature reserve.” Perfect.
On Friday, Talia Ben-Ora, an entry-level customer-service employee at Yelp, posted an open letter to Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman on Medium, detailing her perilous financial situation, the result of her astoundingly low wages. In the letter, Ben-Ora wrote about borrowing money from a CVS employee to pay for her commute to work, eating rice and drinking water to stave off hunger, and spending nearly her entire paycheck on San Francisco rent. She also took several shots at Stoppelman, calling him out for his nine-digit net worth and his house in the East Bay suburb of Moraga (median household income: a hair shy of $100,000). Perhaps not shockingly, she was fired a few hours after the post went viral.
Perhaps also not shockingly, there’s also been intense backlash to her post. You don’t get to challenge the assumptions of an entire industry without facing some criticism, after all! An anonymous website full of “incriminating” Instagrams and tweets of food or liquor Ben-Ora had posted in the past popped up, as though baking cupcakes, eating tacos, or holding a bottle of mid-range bourbon are proof that she wasn’t struggling. On Saturday, a writer named Stefanie Williams — at 29, four years older than Ben-Ora, 25 — who has written most extensively, it seems, for BroBible, posted a response to Ben-Ora’s letter, scorning her for, I guess, being paid minimum wage, not having roommates, not ending her letter by saying she got a job at Starbucks, and, worst of all, for pretending to thrive on Instagram.
“Maybe some advice will help,” Williams offers, “while you drink the incredibly expensive bourbon you posted on your Instagram account and eat that bag of rice, which was the only other thing you could afford!”
Here’s the thing. One, the “incredibly expensive” bourbon was Bulleit, which is, what, $25 a bottle? Two, and you’d think that people in the tech industry would understand this better than anyone, Instagram is not an accurate depiction of a person’s life. “A while ago [I decided] I only want to post stuff on Instagram that makes it seem like I’m thriving, even though I’m not, because I don’t want people to worry about me,” Ben-Ora told Quartz yesterday. As it is for nearly every single other Instagram user, I think it’s safe to say.
Williams is also highly critical of Ben-Ora’s decision to take a job at minimum wage in San Francisco that she knew didn’t necessarily guarantee a promotion, raise, or much else. With the job market as dire as it is for young people, it’s hard to give that much credence. Ben-Ora identified an area she thought would be the best compromise between her English degree and earning actual money — social media for a large tech company — and successfully got an entry-level job at a large tech company. Williams gives lip service to “not particularly” liking Yelp, but conveniently ignores the company’s part to play in this. Does she think it reasonable that a $3.5 billion company pays its employees minimum wage in the most expensive housing market in the country? Or that their response to the Bay Area’s housing crisis (that companies like themselves helped create) is to, uh, hire people in Phoenix and … that’s it? Does Ben-Ora really deserve an orchestrated takedown just because she wants to live and work in San Francisco and also afford food?
Paul Ryan has a beard. Let’s see what Breitbart commenters think of it and compile the results:
This has been “7 Breitbart Commenters Who Think Paul Ryan Might Be a Radical Muslim Because He Grew a Beard.”
And tweeted:
And defended those tweets on television:
Then the news cycle turned, as it inevitably does, and everyone forgot about selfish uncle Gene and his clock conspiracy.
But that was before Ahmed Mohamed and his family threatened this week to sue the city of Irving, Texas, and the Irving School District for violating Ahmed’s civil rights, seeking a total of $15 million and an apology.
Dawkins seized the opportunity on Tuesday morning to double down on his Ahmed hoax theory, even comparing the precocious teen to child members of ISIS:
There was a time when Richard Dawkins was taken seriously. A time before he used Twitter. That time is not now.
Biologist Richard Dawkins, known largely for his hard-line atheism and for blessing and/or cursing us with the the word meme, tweets a lot. Probably too much. So much that he’s started to reveal himself less as one of the leading public intellectuals of his generation than as your kooky uncle who has weird ideas about Muslims. Recently, Richard Dawkins has been obsessed with clock-building teen Ahmed Mohamed, who, Dawkins is convinced, has pulled a grievous hoax on the public.
Ahmed Mohamed and his family have announced they’re moving to Qatar, where Ahmed will study science on a full scholarship. Richard Dawkins continues to reside in his own imagination, where he is constantly under siege by those scary, scary Muslims.
Mohamed first made the news in September for bringing a homemade clock to school and subsequently getting arrested after authorities claimed they mistook it for a bomb. Dawkins was immediately on the case. He decided that the crucial part of the story was not that a Muslim teen had been mistaken for a bomb-maker and treated as a criminal, but that the teen claimed to have invented a clock.
In Dawkins’s estimation, Ahmed had merely built the clock from a kit and was pulling the wool over all our eyes by using the word “invention.” And, who knows, he suggested, maybe Ahmed wanted to be arrested?
Because Dawkins has access to Twitter, but does not have access to even a single modicum of chill, this semantic quibble turned into something of a personal crusade. Dawkins became an Ahmed Mohamed truther.
He tweeted:
So there you have it, straight from the horse’s mouth: Video is the next big thing on the web … until Facebook decides it isn’t.
Speaking at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Monday, Mark Zuckerberg laid out his prospectus on the future of the internet, and, wowee zowee, it looks like it’s gonna be video.
He said, as conveyed by Re/code:
What’s not mentioned is that Zuckerberg’s own company, the Facebook Dot Com, is the web’s most substantial governing body when it comes to ebbs and flows in medium popularity. Video is becoming more popular on the web because the News Feed algorithm is currently weighted toward video uploaded to Facebook (because, in turn, Facebook believes it can make more money by serving up more video and increasing user-engagement time). And the News Feed is the funnel through which millions of people experience the web.
What we end up with is a chicken-or-egg conundrum. In an effort to compete with YouTube, Facebook began heavily favoring its own video platform in the News Feed. People will then begin to upload more videos as they realize that that would garner more attention. Mark Zuckerberg then gets onstage and says, “You know? [long pause] I think video is gonna be popular.” Rinse and repeat.
According to Zuckerberg, text was popular ten years ago, but it’s slipping. He could right that ship if he so chose. It’s entirely possible that text will become a preferred medium again, coincidentally right as Facebook becomes a text-distribution platform via Instant Articles.
Zuckerberg also addressed a video trend that we noted last month in a piece on livestreaming aesthetics. Specifically, the decreasing need for a cohesive, well-coordinated presentation style as live video comes to the fore.
Cards Against Humanity, a popular card game about sex positions and Mecha-Hitler, is known for its annual holiday promotions, which range from mocking Kwanzaa and selling boxes of actual poop to selling absolutely nothing (for $5 per nothing). Sometimes they do good things with the proceeds. Sometimes they buy a Picasso and ask backers to vote on whether or not to destroy it.
In a stunt that BoingBoing describes as “a high-stake bet on morality vs. lulz,” the CAH crew has acquired Picasso’s 1962 Tête de Faune. It’s a minor, but still museum-worthy, work valued at around $14,000. But whether it ends up in the Art Institute of Chicago or gets laser-cut into 150,000 tiny pieces and mailed out to Cards Against Humanity fans is up to people who bought into this year’s Hanukkah promotion. (They think “Pac-Man uncontrollably guzzling cum” is hilarious. And they vote!)
There are a handful of possible hot takes on whether holding a Picasso hostage is a good or funny use of time and money, and none of them are particularly interesting. At level zero, we have the two most basic opinions: “this is an outrage” and “lol.”
One meta-opinion up, at level one, you’ll find “this is an interesting social experiment and/or ethics exam for people who enjoy misanthropic humor,” and “this is a commentary on how Picasso is overrated and/or the value of his work is subjective.”
At meta-meta level two, we have “manipulating customers in this way is unethical, but it’s being done in the same ironic spirit as the name ‘Cards Against Humanity’: “If you want to prove Picasso is overrated, buying his work might not be the way to go about it,” and “this experiment is, in itself, art.”
The correct take is, of course, “none of the above, this is dumb.”
(Due respect, but that’s not email’s fault; that employee just sucks.)
By 2004, PC Magazine was already calling for the death of email, which had turned into a cumbersome nuisance:
(Earlier that year, Bill Gates had told audience at the World Economic Forum that “two years from now, spam will be solved.” He also promised that Microsoft was working on a search engine to trounce Google.)
At this point, “email is bad” had become a reliable subject for the business, lifestyle, and technology press. In 2007, Businessweek reported:
A 2012 study concluded that “people who check their work email regularly exhibit higher states of stress, and less focus, than workers who continue to do their jobs while being cut off from email entirely.”
As email has faced competition from platforms both private — Slack and Whatsapp and Facebook — and public — the text message — the complaining hasn’t stopped. An Atlantic article from January of this year called ”The Triumph of Email” is sub-headlined “Why does one of the world’s most reviled technologies keep winning?” Just a few weeks ago, a Harvard Business Review article presented “A Modest Proposal: Eliminate Email.”
The thing is, it’s been two decades and we still haven’t. So it must be doing something well.
News broke over the weekend that Ray Tomlinson, widely credited as the inventor of email, had passed away at the age of 74. Tomlinson was the prime mover in the creation of a communication system that is still central to billions of peoples’ lives, and has been — correctly — praised as a genius.
In fact, we complain about email so much because it works so well. Email is good at one extremely important thing: sending digital beep-boops to someone quickly. It’s good, in fact, because that’s all it does. (Slack, the most recent product to be presented as an email-killer, replaces emails with chat rooms, DMs, and a sleek mobile app — but wasn’t the idea of being constantly accessible the whole problem with email in the first place, back in 1994?)
We’ve come to expect our software to have new features and iterations and version numbers, but email remains for the most part static and unchanged. Every once in a while, a software developer will build a new app or extension meant to "solve" email. They rarely take, because email’s strength lies in its simplicity. It’s an open standard and a universal tool, not a company pledging to help you accomplish specific tasks or meet specific goals.
In fact, email’s simple strength is exactly why people mistake it for the real problems they face: It adapts to systems (and neuroses) so smoothly and transparently that it seems to create them, rather than enable them.
In business, the problems of overburdened managers and overworked employees are problems of bureaucracy and capitalism and bad managerial structure — not email. There’s a Harvard Business Review article called “Management Time: Who’s Got the Monkey?” that would seem to diagnose the problems with email by writing about “monkeys” — problems that workers hand off to one another, endlessly deferring decisions and creating pileups in manager’s to-do lists (or creating to-do lists entirely). It might sound like your inbox problem, except the article was published in 1974. If email has made decision-making processes worse, it’s because email is very efficient, and those processes were fundamentally flawed in the first place.
In real, non-office life, too, email is seen as bad, but people generally worry about email because they overthink it. Email is a hell we’ve created for ourselves, through our neuroses and our insecurities. In many ways, it’s like a phone service — useful for an infinite number of situations. It’s not the phone’s fault that your aunt keeps calling, it’s your aunt’s (or, maybe, your weird relationship with your aunt). Design expert Don Norman put it succinctly last summer, when he told Fast Company that “the problem is in trying to make email do everything when it’s not particularly good at anything.”
I disagree slightly. I think email is pretty good at something — communicating digitally with another person in an asynchronous, universal way. We can complain about it for another 20 years. We can use Slack and Facebook for Work. Google can add a layer on top to sort out the marketing emails. Mailbox can add useful tweaks like the now-ubiquitous snooze features. But the core works. Email isn’t bad. We’re bad, and our badness is reflected to us in its open, efficient, universal success. And you can’t blame Ray Tomlinson for that.
Which is a bit odd given how his invention has generally been talked about.
If you were to take stock of how people felt about email last Friday, you’d have thought Tomlinson was an Alfred Nobel or a Robert Oppenheimer. “Email sucks,” the tune tends to go. “Email is the worst. Email is bad for your mental health and your business’s well-being. Email is a font of unceasing anxiety; a yoke to which, so long as computers exist, we will be fastened.”
I know this complaint well because it’s now 22 years old. (It may be older than that; it’s just much harder to search the private complaints of the military and academic users of early email.) In 1994, just a few years into the accelerating adoption of the World Wide Web, the New York Times was already describing anxiety over email’s omnipresence:
That piece appeared in the “Style” section. Four days later, in “Home & Garden,” the Times ran this account from a technology researcher:
The complaints didn’t dissipate as email became more familiar. As Carol Hymowitz recalled in The Wall Street Journal in 1999:
Imagine: You are just riding the subway, minding your own business, and you see this.
Nope!!!
After months of speculation and a weekend of hysteria, the long-feared Twitter “algorithmic timeline” is here, and it’s … not a big deal, really? In a post to its official blog today, the platform announced a new option that would be made available to users today: “Show me the best tweets first.”
If you want to turn it on yourself, go to the settings in your app or on the website and check the “Show me the best tweets first” box under the timeline or content settings. (As of publishing, the feature was only live in the most updated version of the mobile apps.)
So, to recap, the “algorithmic timeline” that caused such consternation among Twitter’s power users that #RIPTwitter was a trending topic this weekend is … an option to have Twitter place a handful of algorithmically chosen tweets at the top of your timeline?
Twitter’s spent the last several years cultivating a base of highly engaged and highly visible power users. This has made it, for better and for worse, “relevant,” and created a spirited and sometimes-engrossing culture of discussion, debate, and tweeting “fuck me daddy” at the pope. At the same time, that culture, led by a set of design choices on the product level, is intimidating and confusing for new and infrequent users. This leaves the company in a catch-22: To attract new users, it will need to change the platform; but changing the platform will alienate the power users that give Twitter relevance and, well, a reason to exist.
The botched announcement, and debut, of this minor new option — an expansion of the already present, and seemingly well-liked, “while you were away” feature that was turned into an 18-hour keen on the platform itself — is a good object lesson in this trouble. As a self-hating power user, I tend to feel that CEO Jack Dorsey should say damn the journalists and activists and tech workers and muck with the product. There’s no way Twitter can get worse!
At its best, @dog_rates works as a kind of parody of the cute garbage internet. At the bottom of the web’s chum box or the deepest pits of aggregation, logic starts to break down, resulting in accounts that look like Nelson’s but are actually sincere, instead of informed riffs.
We asked Nelson to prove his dog-rating chops by rating three of the most famous dogs in American history: Lassie, Rin Tin Tin, and Air Bud. Here are his judgments, unimpeachable and final for all time.
“Say hello to Rin Tin Tin. Best actor of the ‘20s. Could jump stupid distances with very little editing. He’s French, but don’t tell Americans that. Embodied the American dream by obeying his masters. 10/10 loved by all.”
“This is Lassie. She totally pushed Timmy down that well. He probably deserved it though. Not racist. Rare for an actor in the ‘50s. Doesn’t know why this child is asking a dog to help fix his bike. 10/10”
“Meet Air Bud. He’s stellar at the sports. There has to be a kid on the bench wondering how the hell a dog is playing in front of him. Well he’s awesome that’s why. Villains always woefully unprepared for Air Bud’s ability to jump over fences. 10/10 simply a badass pupper.”
Matt Nelson, a 19-year-old student in the business program at Campbell University, learned a fundamental lesson of social media when he started tweeting under the handle @matt___nelson two years ago. “The followers on my personal account were always easily entertained by my jokes involving dogs,” he says. Inspiration struck. What if he made an account that only rated dogs? “I utilized Twitter’s new polling feature and asked those followers whether I should make this account. The idea was met with overwhelming optimism, and my first dog rating was of my friend Morgan’s Australian shepherd.”
Thus, on November 15, @dog_rates was born. Over the past two months, the account has ballooned to over 55,000 followers. Many of the photos are cute, of course, in the slightly manic way of @DailyPuppy, but that’s not the reason the account is popular. Nelson’s surreal, irrelevant, and often hilarious captions take it to the next level, a level that we like to call Weird Twitter.
“Meet Larry. He doesn’t know how to shoe. 9/10 damn it Larry,” Nelson writes of a fluffball stuck in a Converse. “This is Pumpkin. He can look in two different directions at once. Great with a screwdriver. 8/10,” reads another. The account tweets incessantly, as many as 18 times a day. “It takes up every ounce of my free time,” Nelson says.
“I have rated some of the most adorable puppies I have ever seen,” he explains. “However, I think the thought that goes into each specific tweet and the time I spend trying to entertain with each rating makes the page much more than another content-aggregating @CuteEmergency account.” In other words, the cuteness provides an opening for his offbeat sense of humor and language.
The professional dog rater takes submissions via Twitter and Instagram, but it’s not just any dog that will receive a rating. There are three categories: “dogs that are so adorable you almost have a stroke, dogs doing things dogs don’t normally do, and ‘dogs,’” Nelson says, referencing his habit of including other non-canine animals. In fact, the funniest @dog_rates tweets don’t picture dogs at all, but hedgehogs, triceratops, and cats that he rates “as if they were dogs.”
Of all the morally depraved, deeply offensive, outrage-worthy things you might click on today: This could be the worst.
A guy who goes by sad_tree on Twitter relived the strangest thing he saw in five years working at Philadelphia Style Pizza and Subs: a regular customer who insisted on ordering two cheese pizzas and carrying them vertically under his arms, no matter what the employees tried to stop him.
“I’ve never hated anyone in my life except this next guy,” the story starts. And if you’re looking for a satisfying, sensible explanation at the end, don’t. Sad_tree and his co-workers never got one.
This story has everything: pizza, suspense, and a crazy person doing an inexplicable and upsetting thing. And you have to admit it wouldn’t be quite as interesting as a wall of text. Best-case scenario: We see a decrease in essay-style “tweetstorms” that should just be blog posts, but bizarre stories like this one and Zola’s stripper saga stick around and become the folk legends of our generation.
The tweetstorms, the odious practice of splitting bad opinions across multiple (usually numbered) tweets, is a much-maligned form that may fade away when Twitter adds the option of 10,000-character tweets. It largely won’t be missed. But if we lose funny multi-tweet narratives like Zola’s Story and this — stories that rely on the peculiar aphoristic cadence of 140-character busts — then it might be time to move to Peach.
Wikimedia Foundation executive director Lila Tretikov resigned earlier today following a tense battle over the organization’s proposed plans for a search engine. According to Motherboard, at issue was Tretikov’s decision to launch “the internet’s first transparent search engine … completely free of commercial interest.” Wikimedia is the governing body that presides over Wikipedia.
The reported purpose of the search engine, dubbed the Knowledge Engine, was to combat decreasing traffic to the free encyclopedia (caused by a growing proportion of mobile browsing and Google’s decision to put Wikipedia information directly into search results, negating the need to click through) though Wikimedia has officially clarified that its purpose was actually internal navigation. Many disagreed with the decision and others were perturbed by the project’s lack of transparency — its very existence was a surprise. Wikimedia heads quickly tried to clarify that the project was about searching within the Wiki project, not competing with Google, but the seeds of doubt had already been planted.
Tretikov’s role as executive director made her the most powerful higher-up at Wikimedia (founder Jimmy Wales’s role is in a more advisory capacity). Internal discussions complained that communication with other members of the leadership and the editing community at large was not up to snuff.
In an email to the Wikimedia listserv, Tretikov wrote, “I move on with confidence that the Foundation can meet new challenges in a challenging environment.” Who will succeed her is unclear, but the site’s directors generally agree that the main priority now is earning back the community’s trust.
Update: This posted has been edited to clarify the conflicting official and reported purposes of the Knowledge Engine.
Police recovered a cell phone left behind by one of the Paris attackers in a garbage can by the concert hall Le Bataclan, according to Le Monde. The phone had texts about the attacks stored on it, though police are unsure as to the identify of the owner of the cell phone or the recipient of the text messages.
What’s more, the phone was “obviously not encrypted” according to Numerama, further weakening arguments that more surveillance could have prevented the attacks. All those arguments for anti-encryption backdoors seem to have been for naught in this case. But ISIS’s other communication channels are actively being targeted.
The app Telegram Messenger announced today that it shut down 78 ISIS-related channels across 12 languages. The app’s emphasis on security apparently made it a favorite for the terrorists. It’s becoming even more clear that the fight for security and preventing these attacks starts not on the ground but online, on some of the largest communication networks in the world — encrypted or not.
Because everything is cyclical and keeps happening again and again and again and again and again and again, we have a new Celebrity Is Really Other, Dead/Missing/Old Celebrity rumor. A video on YouTube with some … interesting theories has led to an ongoing comment-section fight over whether Katy Perry is really grown-up JonBenét Ramsey, a former child pageant queen who was found strangled to death under suspicious circumstances before I learned how to talk.
The Kernel has the definitive explanation of the theory here. The case seems to stem around Perry’s eyebrows (“You know, the eyebrows don’t change much on a person. You’re born with your eyebrows,” Junger Surfer, a YouTube conspiracy theorist, theorizes), this Katy Perry tweet, and little else beyond the fact that some people on the internet said it so now it’s a story.
Far more interesting than a too-out-there internet conspiracy theory is beef between YouTube conspiracy theorists. As chronicled by the Kernel’s Rick Paulas, various YouTubers in the conspiracy-theory community have posted videos accusing Dave J (photo below), a weed-ripping major proponent of the JonBenét Perry theory, not only of planting fake stories in order to distract everyone’s attention from what’s really important, e.g., the Bilderberg Group, but also of being Huffington Post political reporter Arthur Delaney.
Delaney denied being Dave J to the Kernel. A representative for Universal Music Group, Perry’s label, did not respond to a request for comment, which is not a denial. Is Katy Perry JonBenét Ramsey? Probably.
There is a lot of cocoa-butter discussion.
Khaled’s talks are highly anticipated events, as they should be.
But when he messes up, the fans let him know.
All of the comments are great.
Another one.
Rapper DJ Khaled truly blew up online this year. His Snapchat presence is one of the best around, dispensing the major keys (🔑) to success. The Verge named him “the year’s most positive meme,” and people were enraptured this past month when he got lost on a Jet Ski. We’ve covered Khaled before, but as Khaled would say: Another one.
On Reddit, a small community of users has congregated on r/WeTheBest (an oft-repeated Khaled phrase) to analyze his postings, figure out the keys to success, and “bless up.”
Users analyze everything from his 🔑s …
… to his interactions with Snapchat mainstay, caterer Chef Dee, who appears constantly with delicious dishes for Khaled to chow down on.
There are also daily discussion threads. Some users expressed concern over Khaled’s recent elliptical workout, which he continued to post during.
Two weeks ago, the YouTube prankster Adrian Gruszka, better known as Adrian Gee, posted a video on his channel in which he pretended to be a blind man, asking people on the street if they had change for a $5 bill and then handing them a $50. Many of the people in the video corrected Gruszka’s mistake. That video, “The Real Blind Man Honesty Test (Social Experiment),” currently has more than 2.1 million views.
Gruszka is one of a host of YouTubers who’ve built a cottage industry out of Candid Camera–style pranks — usually in which the host and star says outrageous or offensive things to supposedly real people, sometimes testing their reactions but more often just trying to provoke an outsize response. The Adrian Gee channel currently has over 189,000 subscribers, and it features many videos similar to the blind test: “Dropping the Phone in Public,” “Asking GIRLS If They MASTURBATE!” and “My Mom Said I Need A Girlfriend. Let’s kiss?”
Gruszka’s also a fake. He was unmasked earlier this week by the Australian program Today Tonight: All of the people featured in the “blind test” video were actors. Armed with casting calls and a series of behind-the-scenes photos, they confronted Gruszka with the evidence. One of the actors even listed the video on his résumé.
Confronted with the evidence, Gruszka and his producing partner walked out of the interview. Two of the actors featured in the video say that they weren’t aware of how the footage would be used, and are now worried about being branded as real-life thieves.
But maybe more directly: A service where everything is nakedly public and available all the time breeds a culture of antagonism and entitlement. Low-level harassment is often driven by the sense that a given user “owes” her antagonist a response. Fusion editor Alexis Madrigal took to Twitter on Saturday worried about the service’s apparent slow death and the possibility that it might not become the promised “noosphere,” by which he means a “real time network of minds.” My inclination is to say: Good. I’m not sure that the world needs one. Not all content is intended for everyone; not all content needs to be accessible to everyone. You can argue that Twitter should be the place where it is — “Twitter is public” is the unimpeachably true Big Dogs–style slogan here — but that dooms Twitter to unpopularity. Who would go to a bar where every conversation you have is immediately crashed by rude and disagreeable interlocutors — or, worse, broadcast on television?
Asking an algorithm alone to change Twitter’s aggressive culture is probably too much. But I think reordering the timeline could at least push Twitter closer to the crowded-bar ideal of social media, where conversations are public and somewhat available to civil and interested strangers, but not quite so exposed or easily reproducible.
It’s true that it’s unsettling to take a public, openly available network, and add a new and opaque formula for sorting. I tend to have a heighten-the-contradictions feeling about this: If we wanted a public, openly available network for information, we shouldn’t have given the contract to a corporation that’s freely available to change its terms at any time. Twitter is not a public utility. An algorithm, at least, makes the relationship between customer and service more clear.
Plus, I don’t think the algorithm is really going to hide anything from us the way people fear. For the last several months, my favorite new Twitter feature — sorry, Moments — is “While you were away,” a small package of tweets inserted at the top of my feed when I open the website or the app after several hours away. Unlike the enticement emails Twitter sends to users who haven’t logged on in a while, which tend to be filled with hugely popular tweets and images from celebrities and news organizations, the tweets delivered to me in “While you were away” are small and ordinary and rarely blockbusters by Twitter’s metrics — they’re one-liners and observations and photos tweeted out by the friends and colleagues whose Twitter accounts I regularly check and interact with.
According to the Verge, the “While you were away” algorithm will be the basis of the new algorithmic timeline. I have to say: It works well for me. It never shows me tweets I’ve seen and only rarely does it show me tweets I don’t care about. Maybe most important, it doesn’t show me tweets from the people or institutions I don’t care about — the accounts I follow because of the requirements of my job, or my desire to understand the contexts of Twitter. It treats Twitter not as a public space — a pure news feed or informational “noosphere” — but as a semi-private one, geared to me, like a social network. As such it’s a small reminder that Twitter can be engaging as well as obligating, that there is a reason to use and enjoy the service beyond compulsion and duty. It holds my attention and wins my affection in a way that my regular, reverse-chronological timeline rarely does, and I expect “algorithmic Twitter” will do more or less the same thing. And if it doesn’t, there’s always Facebook.
The algorithm is coming. On Friday night, BuzzFeed reported that “as soon as next week” Twitter would be introducing an “algorithmic timeline,” which would “reorder tweets based on what Twitter’s algorithm thinks people most want to see,” unlike the current timeline, which is arranged in reverse chronological order.
The new algorithmic timeline will be a relatively small change, as the Verge has reported — and, importantly, you can opt out. But the backlash was, as usual, swift and self-righteous (Twitter, having developed the world’s greatest platform for complaint, is also its own favorite target). #RIPTwitter began to trend. Rob Lowe weighed in. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was forced to address the story in a particularly uninspiring set of tweets assuring users that “[w]e never planned to reorder timelines next week.” Seemingly placated, Twitter went back to screencapping Beyoncé dual-wielding middle fingers.
The reasons for switching to — or adding — an algorithmic timeline are obvious. Twitter can be a forbidding place, visually and culturally, and a smartly tuned sorting system could make it more welcoming to both new and infrequent users. And, yes, to advertisers. Explaining to advertisers that your social network has an algorithmic feed “like Facebook’s” is likely to get them to open their wallets much more quickly.
Of course, “like Facebook” is exactly what Twitter’s power users are afraid of hearing. “Hey, @Twitter,” read one widely circulated Tweet (from an, uh, Avengers fan account), “there is a reason why we are here and not on Facebook. Do not have that new algorithm.” “The reason,” of course, is that Facebook sucks. This is the standard line: It’s safer, dumber, more corporate; its algorithmic newsfeed is spoon-feeding you garbage. Twitter, on the other hand, is open, public, universal, always available.
I’m sympathetic to this sense of Twitter as a sort of free informational zone, one of those places of pure internet where it can feel like galaxies of ideas are at your fingertips. I spent hours a day on Twitter for years; at its peak, it felt like the most fresh and invigorating place online, in part because of the sheer volume of useful or entertaining information it contained. At the same time I found Facebook nearly unusable, lousy with noise, always just a click away from a forgotten and disliked high-school classmate or relative.
But the thing is. And I never thought I would say this: Lately I’ve been spending a lot more time on Facebook than on Twitter. In fact, Facebook has, lately, seemed, actually, kind of … fun. I see funny videos and images on it, not just the Hallmark glurge that felt inescapable a few years ago, and I often see them there first, before Twitter. I participate in communities that range from the entertainingly weird to genuinely edifying. I have discussions — political discussions, even! — that are sharp and satisfying and only rarely party-crashed by the stupid or malevolent.
Twitter, on the other hand, is … Twitter. It’s not just that it’s no longer fresh or invigorating or, as Josh Topolsky put it at The New Yorker, “necessary,” it’s that it lately feels like it’s seething with ill will and miscommunication and argument. This is not just a complaint about the rise of Gamergate and its associated reactionary and white-supremacist comrades-in-tweet, though they’re part of it. Even the smartest communities of journalists and activists and trolls feel stale and mechanical, trapped in cycles of self-promotion and ideological battle. Three weeks spent reading people I generally like and respect argue disingenuously on Twitter about “Berniebros” has made me, I think, actively stupider. That, in the midst of a presidential election, Twitter is unbearable and Facebook is pleasurable is remarkable, given that even just two years ago their positions would’ve been reversed.
Could algorithmic sorting fix this? I think, actually … maybe. Twitter’s great problem over the last two or more years is that the culture and features that attract its power users also enable its worst trolls and abusers. A social network with public accounts, frictionless republishing, and direct communication sounds fantastic but it also directly creates a system where everyone is just a retweet and miscommunication away from mentions hell. Of course a service that made it easy to hound Scott Baio into a spitting rage over diaper fetishism can be used for much less funny, and much more troubling, kinds of trolling.
Loosely organized hacker collective Anonymous “declared total war” on ISIS last week but has thus far failed to make much of a dent in the terrorist group’s considerable social media presence. Another group of hackers has been more successful, though, and now a former ISIS propaganda site is just a Viagra ad and a request to chill out with this whole jihadist thing. “Too much ISIS,” the page concludes.
The group behind the attack is apparently a hacking collective called GhostSec (not to be confused with the more legitimate Ghost Security Group), who replaced an alleged ISIS recruitment site on the dark web with a good weed reference and a banner ad for an online pharmacy.
“Too Much ISIS. Enhance your calm,” the site now reads, a callback to Twitter’s infamous weed-themed “error 420” message.
“Too many people are into this ISIS-stuff. Please gaze upon this lovely ad so we can upgrade our infrastructure to give you ISIS content you all so desperately crave.”
An earlier version of this post confused Ghost Sec, an Anonymous-linked group behind this hack, and Ghost Security Group, a hacker collective unaffiliated with Anonymous.
Anti-bird-poaching activists in France were greeted on Monday by a man, sans pants, attacking them with a shovel. He is now une grande meme.
According to BuzzFeed, the activists and the journalists accompanying them got into an argument with the man, who embodies the French values of resistance and pantslessness. The result was this meme-ready photo.
The pantsless shovel man has dug his way into the hearts and minds of the people, who have since taken this photo and remixed it.
In a brief interview on NPR, former national-security official Richard Clarke explicitly criticized the FBI’s lawsuit against Apple, an effort to compel the company to build software compromising the security of their devices.
Clarke — who directed counterterrorism operations under the Clinton and Bush administrations — believes that, on a legal level, the FBI is fighting an uphill battle, since courts have ruled in the past that code is an expression of speech. “This is a case where the government, using a 1789 law [the All Writs Act], is trying to compel speech,” he said.
Compounding this, Clarke says that the FBI does not have much support from other government agencies or prominent national-security figures. “I don’t think it’s a fierce debate. I think that the Justice Department and the FBI are on their own here,” he said, adding that FBI director James Comey “is exaggerating the need for this, and is trying to build it up as an emotional case.”
What is at stake here, in Clarke’s interpretation, is the legal precedent set by the case. He said that Comey was looking for a legal battle, and that if they really wanted to the NSA could crack the phone open. That’s mostly beside the point. “Every expert I know believes that the NSA can crack this phone,” he asserted. “They [the FBI] want a precedent that the government can compel a computer device manufacturer to allow the government in.”
And there was Omikron. It’s unclear exactly how Bowie hooked up with the developers, but during the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo, when promotion of the game was in full swing, an executive with Eidos, the game’s publisher, said that Bowie “spent two hectic weeks in design sessions with us in Paris.”
Bowie would play two characters in the game: The first, Boz, is a cyberbeing who exists within computer networks. (It seems slightly odd only until you stack it up against Bowie’s many other personas, as well as his early adoption of the World Wide Web.) Elsewhere, Bowie appears with collaborators Reeves Gabrels and Gail Ann Dorsey in a virtual band that performs in bars around the city. (Supermodel Iman, Bowie’s wife, also appeared in the game as one of the city’s residents whom players can reincarnate as.) Speaking about his appearance at the time, he said: Coming across my digital alter-ego in a dark street is not necessarily my idea of fun - but to anyone else who comes across my character in the game, well, I think they’ll judge my performance in terms of its cinematic characterization like one would any dramatic performance. So, lucky for those digital creations in there who don’t have real-life counterparts to be analyzed! The game has turned out to have a very cinematic feel, with the music adding emotional depth to the playing out of the drama.
So, lucky for those digital creations in there who don’t have real-life counterparts to be analyzed: The game has turned out to have a very cinematic feel, with the music adding emotional depth to the playing out of the drama.”
Sadly, the drama didn’t quite cut it. Omikron takes place in a city of the same name (“the interactive love child of Blade Runner and The Fifth Element,” as the New York Times put it), in which a player navigates the futuristic setting. Its "Nomad Soul" subtitle comes from the game’s central mechanic: being able to switch bodies and characters at will. Reviews of the game, both contemporary and retrospective, are less than glowing, calling much of the game half-baked.
But more important to Bowie fans, he’d written music for the game. Bowie said, “I moved right away from the stereotypical industrial game-music sound. … My priority in writing music for Omikron was to give it an emotional subtext. It feels to me as though Reeves and I have achieved that. We both worked closely with Quantic Dream to come up with eight new songs for the game.”
Those songs would later end up on Hours, alongside the very first “cyber song.”
Omikron hasn’t aged well — graphically or structurally — but it helped kickstart a growing mainstream interest in games, and celebrity interest in being involved in them. Maybe more important, it stands as another artifact of Bowie’s thirst for experimentation and change — and his love for the artistic and transformative properties of technology and the internet. “I don’t think we’ve even seen the tip of the iceberg,” Bowie told Jeremy Paxman in 2000. “I think the potential of what the Internet is going to do to society both good and bad is unimaginable. I think we’re on the cusp of something exhilarating and terrifying.”
As tributes and remembrances roll out today, we will hear a lot about David Bowie — as a musician, as an actor, as a public speaker. And, maybe, as a … video-game character. Back around the turn of the century, Bowie made video-game history (well, video-game-history footnote, at least) with an appearance in Omikron: The Nomad Soul, an odd hybrid of a video game for the PC and ill-fated Sega Dreamcast. Developed by Quantic Dream, Omikron featured Bowie’s musical work and, in what it claimed was a first for the industry, the entertainer’s virtual likeness.
Some context: Bowie had always been fascinated with science fiction and cutting-edge technology, an obsession he demonstrated over and over again in his choices as a musician and actor, and the 1990s — and the rise of the internet — were a particularly fruitful time for this passion.
In 1995, Bowie and producer Brian Eno reunited to make Outside, an industrial-influenced art-cyberpunk concept album for which he wrote a short story and invented a new set of characters; for years, he teased the possibility of releasing sequels with more material from those sessions — “documenting,” he proposed, “the last five years of this millennium,” one at a time.
Outside’s legendary sequel, Contamination, never materialized, but Bowie’s fascination with the internet continued apace. In 1999, he recorded what press releases enthusiastically described as the “first cyber song,” co-written with a lyrics-contest winner from Bowie’s six-dollar-a-month fan site, BowieNet. Streamed over RealAudio, the song was called “What’s Really Happening.” Here he is talking about it on a show called Internet Tonight:
And here’s the song itself, later featured on his album Hours (the cover art for which fits exactly into the early-web aesthetic now embraced by vaporwave and the DIS crew):
SCREAMING
SCREAMING.
You’re a good boy.
The American Kennel Club keeps a list of the year’s most popular and trendy dog names to help you “get off to the perfect start with your new pup,” who will be named in the manner of an upper-middle-class suburban child: Finn, Echo, Lilly, Bowen, or Nova. Print it out, tear it up, and recycle the pieces. The best source on the internet for extremely good and real dog names — Repressed Childhood, Alan Rickman’s Voice, Assthetic — is the Twitter account @RealDogNames.
Now those are some real names you can definitely imagine calling your beloved pet several times each day.
Get out of here, Sawyer, Dixie, and Emerson. Get over here, SCREAMING
The FBI will probably not accept his offer.
The eyes of the world are on a single iPhone this week. It belonged to one of the San Bernardino shooters, and the FBI would love to get its hands on the information contained within. But Apple has refused to assist, arguing that maybe it’s not a good thing for the government to have a backdoor into every iPhone. It seems we’re at an impasse. But wait, who’s this? It’s cybersecurity legend and psychedelic drug enthusiast John McAfee!
You may remember McAfee as the founder of antivirus company McAfee and Associates, or, more recently, as a guy who went on the run to escape a bizarre murder investigation in Belize. Now he’s volunteered to decrypt the iPhone for the FBI, avoiding the need for Apple to build that backdoor. McAfee is even more pessimistic than Tim Cook about the precedent Apple would set by complying with the FBI’s demands, claiming “our world, as we know it, is over.”
But, assuming the bureau would turn evidence over to an eccentric software millionaire with a colorful history, how does McAfee intend to break the encryption on the San Bernardino iPhone? It’s assumed that brute force is not an option, because the phone will erase itself after 10 wrong passcode attempts thanks to a security feature that the FBI is asking Apple to disable.
It’s also assumed that the FBI can’t disable the feature itself because doing so would require custom firmware, code-signed by Apple.
McAfee is unimpressed, and claims that if the FBI had any “true hackers” in its employ, it would have opened the phone already. Conveniently, McAfee claims to have several such people working for him.
“With all due respect to Tim Cook and Apple, I work with a team of the best hackers on the planet,” he writes. “These hackers attend Defcon in Las Vegas, and they are legends in their local hacking groups, such as HackMiami. They are all prodigies, with talents that defy normal human comprehension. About 75% are social engineers. The remainder are hardcore coders.”
It’s through social engineering — the practice of talking people into giving you information they’re not supposed to reveal — that McAfee plans to get into the phone. It’s probably true that Apple’s people are more vulnerable than its software, but I can’t imagine how this would work, and McAfee obviously can’t reveal the details of his plan publicly.
“It will take us three weeks,” he writes to the FBI. “If you accept my offer, then you will not need to ask Apple to place a back door in its product, which will be the beginning of the end of America.”
On the ceiling of Señor Frog’s were jokey aphorisms you might find on, well, the Fat Jew’s Instagram account. This one said: “Become good at cheating and you never need to become good at anything else.” Hmm.
Bored, I flipped through Ostrovsky’s book, which features a cover parodying Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs. A nice, original touch. The forward of Money, Pizza, Respect is written by Tyrese, the actor and model whose Facebook page is a transparent attempt to pass off viral chum in the hopes of gaining a huge audience and attracting sponsors. That also seems fitting. The inside of the book was signed “XOXOXO Fat Jew!”
Onstage, a D.J. spun in front of an inflatable pool that contained a blow-up killer-whale toy. Why it was there had yet to be revealed. It was seven, half an hour after the start time for this two-hour event, and Ostrovsky still had not appeared.
I attempted to talk to a few people, but the blasting music made that difficult, as did the general awkwardness of talking about social media off social media. It later became clear that a lot of people were there for the photo op, hoping to use Ostrovsky’s fame to get a few likes of their own. Others crowded around the pool. People expected Ostrovsky’s good-time party-guy brand to translate to, if not IRL good-time parties, at least some kind of shenanigans. Perhaps even an epic or legendary party event.
At 7:12, I noticed a small crowd ebbing toward the left side of the stage. It turns out that that was where Ostrovsky had appeared. No one had announced his arrival. He had just, sort of, showed up? People were respectfully crowding him to snag selfies. There were two security guards in orange shirts doing crowd control, which seemed unnecessary. Ostrovsky was easy to spot because of his unique hairdo. One thing that doesn’t come across online is that the dude has to constantly fix the long spindle of hair jutting from the top of his head.
I stood back a bit. Eventually, the Fat Jew (who, I would like to note, is honestly not that fat!) climbed onstage and got into the inflatable pool. He still hadn’t really addressed the crowd, but they seemed happy to get pictures with him. One man, who I would guess was in college, Facetimed a female friend to bring her genuine live footage of the Fat Jew. At one point, a Señor Frog’s employee offered the Fat Jew a mic, in case he wanted to say anything to the crowd. He waved it off.
I was waiting for the party to start, but it soon became clear that it had. This was the party. The Fat Jew had nothing to say, no announcements to make; he was not hosting, or schmoozing guests, or … doing keg stands, or whatever. I had misunderstood the Fat Jew concept. The idea was not to have an actual party, it was to help his fans create minorly viral content of their own: a photograph of themselves with the Fat Jew.
The author’s note at the beginning of Money, Pizza, Respect, the new book by Instagram celebrity the Fat Jew (real name Josh Ostrovsky) begins with this sentence: “Imagine going out and partying HARD. I’m talking binge-drinking and administering drugs through your butthole (they work faster that way).” Last night’s book signing, at the Times Square Señor Frog’s, was not that party.
I inched closer to the small crowd surrounding the stage. There was no pushing, just everyone shuffling slowly toward the man in the pool, handing their phones to the assigned picture-taker, and posing for photos. I handed over my phone and stepped up to the Fat Jew. I was too afraid to say anything. Sensing my nervousness, the Fat Jew drew me in close and placed a reassuring hand on my chest.
Nailed it.
I went to the bathroom and by the time I had returned, the Fat Jew had vanished. The area surrounding the stage had mostly cleared out and it seemed like the party was over. Just as mysteriously as he had appeared, he had disappeared. It was 7:50, 40 minutes earlier than the 8:30 end time that Ostrovsky had announced on Instagram earlier that day. As I exited upstairs, I noticed that people were still buying his book to get in.
But I had created my own content. I sent the picture to a couple of friends in order to gauge reaction. “OMG WHAT,” texted one friend. “HOLY FUCK,” said the other. Not viral, but close enough.
The Fat Jew is a performance artist and commentator, currently best known for his popular Instagram account, where he posts pictures with funny (or “funny”) captions. Most of the time, the jokes are not of his own making: He is a “curator,” though he caught flack this past summer, after rumors he’d landed a television deal, for not properly crediting the people who actually make most of the content.
Widely derided by people who write jokes online for a living (or just for the satisfaction of a fave or a like), the Fat Jew’s success rests on the way he takes the work out of finding funny social-media posts. For many people, he is the main conduit between their Instagram feeds and the rest of the meme-y, jokey internet. His tone is broad, conversational, and enthusiastic; raunchy, but rarely political. The humor he collects tends to be of the observational kind: “That feeling where …” “My face when …” As with most widely copy-and-pasted jokes, the implied audience is young — the cultural references date back to the ‘90s and not much further — and professional, stressed-out, feeling a bit like a failure choosing between jobs and friends.
It’s probably also possible to attribute some part of the Fat Jew’s success to his look. He appears often shirtless, with a long ponytail that sticks straight up from the top of his head. His fatness, and his weird hair, seem meant to position him as a jolly party host; a friendly guy with lots of jokes. The Facebook invitation promised: “Come and reminisce over Amanda Bynes’ meltdown, which was the best thing to ever happen on the internet. Come and I’ll give you a lapdance in a restaurant, which will be super weird.”
So around 6 p.m. yesterday, I headed up to Times Square and got in line outside of Señor Frog’s. I was probably tenth in line, waiting for the privilege to pay $20 for a copy of the Fat Jew’s book and a drink ticket. Most of the attendees seemed to have realized that throwing the term “fat Jew” around in the middle of Times Square was maybe not the best move: “Are you here for the book thing?” “Is this the line for Señor Frog’s?” they asked. We were ushered inside, received our books, and descended down into the lower level of the venue, a neon hell without cell-phone reception.
The first thing I did was head over to the bar to claim my free drink. My ticket, I was told, was only good for the White Girl Wasted cocktail or the White Girl Wasted rosé. I went with the rosé. A woman at the bar searching for a phone charger told me how great Señor Frogs is, especially the one in the Bahamas: “It gets pretty wild.” I nodded, since my only knowledge of Señor Frog’s was as the last known location of Natalee Holloway.
As it turned out, the bar was waiting on special glasses for the wine (plastic wine glasses). Unwilling to wait that long, I swapped my order for the White Girl Wasted cocktail, which was frozen and possibly strawberry. It was the first time I have ever been white girl wasted.
Only parts of Señor Frog’s — mainly the area immediately surrounding the stage — were for people there for the book launch. Stage left, a third of the room had been cordoned off for another event, and even within the space reserved for the Fat Jew, a few brave patrons were sitting down and ordering food. This seemed about right for the Fat Jew, or any Instagram celebrity: not dominating the entire space, but holding on, diffusely, to a large part of.
Hate Justin Bieber? You will love his “secret brother” Joob. You will love Joob … or else. Fusion explains:
A photo of Bieber posted to the forums of pop-music site ATRL was immediately seized by the Tumblr Shady iTunes Edits: “It has been confirmed that Justin Bieber’s brother, Joob Bieber, has recently been released from his life CHAINED to a bucket in their mother Pattie’s attic.” I cannot personally confirm the existence of Joob Bieber, but I want to believe. He has proven extremely popular on Tumblr, at any rate.
Is Joob single, you’re wondering? Perhaps he is dating Poot Lovato, his predecessor in pop-star internet’s bizarro-celebrity mirrorscape by about a month. Poot! We love you, Poot!
Developing a video game as a propaganda tool and distributing it on Steam? Who would do something like that?
“Mr. Falcon” needs your help. Which of his friends has trouble correctly using quotation marks?
This next one is hard. Which of your “Blastoff” friends is a violent extremist?
“I know we haven’t met, but you should come join our fight overseas.” Boom. That’s an incredibly strong opener. Sean’s a violent international extremist, but he won’t waste your time.
Finally, after completing all of the quizzes, you get a neat certificate with a creepy mannequin image.
If there’s one thing you can say about ISIS, besides the fact that it’s a medieval death cult responsible for inconceivable blood crimes, it’s that its recruiters are very charming on social media. But don’t worry: The Federal Bureau of Investigation is ready to fight back. It used your tax dollars to create Don’t Be A Puppet, a website for educating teens on violent extremism and the ways that online recruiters make contact. I took the site for a spin yesterday to earn an online certificate (really) in “countering violent extremism,” and quickly discovered: The FBI is bad at talking to teens.
The site’s main tactic for teaching its users about violent extremism is a set of quizzes, which cover not just international groups like ISIS but also white supremacists and that scourge of 21st-century America, environmental extremists.
You’ll realize that we’re working with something special when you arrive at this, the FBI’s mockup of a teen’s computer screen. You know, Just Teen Things: hundreds of lines of HTML and CSS.
My favorite portion of the site is for quizzes that help teens identify which sorts of online posts might actually be recruiters in disguise.
Which one of these fake Reddit posts is actually an ISIS recruiter in disguise? Tricky, right? (It’s the post about justifiable bombings.)
This one’s great. Here is what the FBI believes: that violent extremists will go through the process of developing a video game and passing certification on digital distribution platform Steam — sorry, “Water Gas” — just to get new members.
Swiss photographer Tiziana Vergari Instagrammed a picture of her daughters sitting near a mirror last week, and since then a barrage of commenters have been freaking out because it’s hard to tell where the girls end and the mirror begins.
To a lot of people it looks like four. To others, two. If you count every daughter in the lineup, there are 13. Are any of these the right answer? Put on your deerstalker cap and see if you can figure it out. The tags offer a solid clue: Two girls are tagged, plus what appears to be Vergari’s dummy account, and Zara, which is a clothing store, and not a human.
Vergari also hopped into the comments to let everyone know that she’s the mother of two girls:
Can those clues together prove how many daughters we’re looking at? It’s tough to say.
It seems like freestyle skier Nicolas Vuignier has stumbled on the next big thing in extreme sports video. For a long time, the sector has been dominated by GoPros and other similar products, or if you couldn’t afford that, a phone in a selfie stick.
But those options are old news. The next big thing is string tied to a phone. Using this so-called string, Vuignier twirled the phone around him while skiing, harnessing the centripetal force of our natural world (scientists still don’t entirely understand it) to film this cool video.
Vuignier says that the technique required “two years of tinkering and tweaking” to perfect. Looks like it worked. Keep an eye on the string industry; no wonder GoPro stock is falling.
This sense of endless, expanding leisure couldn’t last forever. Just a few hours later, in the early evening on the East Coast, BuzzFeed hit publish on the defining work of the viral-web era, “What Colors Are This Dress?” The internet, pop culture, the words the dress, and our lives were never the same.
We’d gone from cheering together to arguing with each other, disparaging the eyesight and intelligence of friends and family. Instead of laughing and smiling at the silly llama chase, we were getting headaches from color combos (I think I saw periwinkle and pink at some point), squinting to see the colors shift before our strained eyes.
Writers and editors and social-media managers scrambled to find their angle on the dress. Angry tweets were fired off. Bad memes were plastered all over social media. Relationships were tested. To this day, friends will not trust my judgment on colors — because I saw the dress in the right colors.
The simple truth is this: A good meme is hard to find. Those llamas had broken their chains and risked their lives to give us something to stare at. And instead of giving them their rightful place as that year’s great viral story, we gave in to the — honestly, super-ugly — striped dress.
Memes are rarely as positive and happy as the llama chase. They’re usually jokes being made at an unsuspecting person’s expense, to insult whoever is unlucky enough to be on the receiving end, or are just plain mean and dumb. (See: What are thooooose?, celebrities crying, “Why You Lying,” Be Like Bill, any meme that used a regular person’s face without their knowledge or permission.) The llamas were none of those things.
There’s still hope for us. Damn, Daniel, the teen who’s back at it again with the white Vans, is our best new hope at a Good Meme. Daniel is clearly in on the joke, laughing, not being mocked, repeatedly complimented on his style. (It also gets bonus points for only having two lines to remember in a ridiculous voice, so embarrassing misquoting is nearly impossible.) Once again, the people of the internet can unite over a meme based purely in positivity, even though jerks are already trying to ruin it.
Protect Damn, Daniel at all costs! It has taken us a year to gain back the Good Meme ground the llamas risked their lives to run freely over, and we must learn from our mistakes.
So today, on this humble February 26, the only meme anniversary I’ll be acknowledging is the best one: the llama chase. Instead of getting a headache by staring at too many stale dress memes re-aggregated from a year ago, watch this 18-minute clip of the llama chase and remember what joy and freedom look like. The llamas, an extensive BuzzFeed oral history published today tells us, are back home, though things aren’t quite the same: “The white llama, she’s never really come back around,” owner Karen Freund says. “She learned what she can get away with. She was always a bit difficult to deal with. Bit of an attitude.” That sounds about right.
One year ago today, two llamas, tired of being cogs in the petting-zoo machine, saw an opportunity to break free of their mundane lives as retirement-community emotional-support animals and ran toward hope of a new life. Toward freedom.
It was just before 1 p.m. in Sun City, Arizona, when the best livestreamed chase ever began to reach bored office workers’ screens across the country, perfectly timed for the West Coast lunch lull and prime mid-afternoon slump time on the East Coast.
“LLAMA WATCH:” the local news station’s tweet began in inviting all-caps. Say no more. For the next half-hour, we joined together IRL and URL to cheer on these freedom-loving rebels — Thellama & Llouise — getting a sweet taste of life outside their petting-zoo handlers’ shackles.
And what a glorious 30 minutes it was! We high-fived when the llamas, seemingly cornered by police, ready to meet their caged end, bolted through an opening and once again evaded the oppressive animal-control state. We applauded their commitment to the team, rooting for them to stay together when one llama was lingering a little too far behind the other — “strength in numbers,” and all. We lamented when they were inevitably separated, as we all knew the end was nigh. They must’ve been so scared without each other, those poor llamas.
Usually, when a police chase grabs the nation’s attention, it’s for much more sinister reasons. With the Great Llama Chase of 2015, the stakes were low. The cops didn’t appear to use weapons other than lassos. Since this unfolded in a retirement community, the roads were relatively empty and low-speed. Llamas running don’t really require cops in cars to floor it, anyway.
The llamas, at times, even roamed at a leisurely pace, trotting around, taking in the lush Arizonan scenery of dry grass, sidewalks, and dirt. (Hey, it’s got to be better than a petting-zoo pen full of your own poop.)
Depending on your perspective, Mark Zuckerberg is either one of the principal heroes or villains of the oversharing age. His superpower involves consolidating information about the world’s humans into Facebook Inc. and creating new incentives for users to generate more data. It seems Zuck would like you to think of him as a hero: He recently tried to upgrade his personal narrative from be-hoodied boy wonder to billionaire philanthropist, and now he’s announced he’s building his own version of Iron Man’s faithful virtual assistant, Jarvis.
For each of the past several years, Zuckerberg has taken on an annual challenge. Last year’s was to read a book every other week, and he’s previously taken on learning Mandarin and only eating animals he killed himself. In 2016, he’s announced he wants to automate parts of his home and work by building a simple AI like the one used by Marvel’s Tony Stark — a hugely popular fictional billionaire who stands for the idea that the superrich may be dicks, but they’re cool dicks who want to save humanity (or at least their own vision of it).
Huh. Can’t imagine why a character like that would resonate with Mark Zuckerberg.
Here’s his vision for his own personal machine intelligence:
And whenever there’s a crisis, it will also assemble the pieces of Iron Zuck’s super-suit and draw them directly to him so he can spring into action. (This part only happens in his imagination).
Looks like: a private photo vault — for amateurs (a preview screenshot shows an album called “ex-girlfriends”). Is actually: a private photo vault — for pros. Price: a staggering $3.99. If your teen has this app: She is a pro pervert.
Hide Calculator
Looks like: the official iPhone calculator Is actually: a photo vault with an Apple Watch app Price: $5.99 for the full version If your teen has this app: He is spending too much money just for Apple Watch functionality.

Looks like: a calculator. Actually, not really; it barely looks like a calculator. And the app symbol peels up to reveal a pair of bare legs. Is actually: a photo vault with “wi-fi transfer export and import” as well as a “built-in camera.” Price: $0.99 removes the photo limit If your teen has this app: She needs lessons in subterfuge.
Photo Vault & Video Lock Safe
Parents: Is your teen constantly playing around on a smartphone calculator app? You may think he’s enthralled by the magic of addition and subtraction, but he’s almost certainly sexting with one of the many iPhone apps that disguise a camera or photo album as something more innocuous.
Looks like: an umbrella (?) Is actually: a vault with touch I.D. and protection for documents, passwords, and text messages. “Manage your life better!” indeed. Price: $2.99 for pro If your teen has this app: He is remarkably open and mature about his secret sexting.
It keeps on going. Private Photo Video Manager is a zipped leather pouch. Secret Folder Icon looks like an icon of an iPhone folder. But to a resourceful teen, anything can be used for sexting. The best strategy for a parent is to take away the phone entirely.
The latest teen-sexting scandal to make the rounds on highly shareable blog posts involves secret iPhone photo vaults disguised as calculators or other innocuous apps. The Washington Post writes that a "massive illicit photo ring run by a high school football team in Canon City, Colo." was long kept secret thanks to "ghost apps," which, in the moral-panicked minds of local-TV newscasters, are the latest weapon of the lustful cyborgs that make up the current generation of teenagers.
Are teens really using secret photo apps? For one thing, it’s not clear what’s meant by “ghost apps”: “One of the apps turns out to actually be some way to send messages to and from others that aren’t meant to be permanent,” George Welsh, the school’s superintendent, told KKTV. That sounds an awful lot like Snapchat, which isn’t a secret photo vault, and which has a ghost as its logo.
But photo vaults are very real indeed, and easily found at the app store. Some even use two separate passwords — one password accesses the stored data and another decoy is used to erase everything on the app instantly so no incriminating evidence will be found. And far be it from us to stand in the way of parental paranoia. Is your teen using one of these apps? It may already be too late.

Who was that man? I guess we’ll never know.
By now you’ve heard about last night’s incredible Super Bowl halftime performance, starring Beyoncé and Bruno Mars. They played all the hits! “Formation,” “Uptown Funk." Those two songs, for sure.
But there is still one question that many viewers want to know: Who was that random dude who joined them for the finale?
Empire star Taraji P. Henson briefly identified the man as a member of the band Maroon 5 …
… but quickly deleted her comment after realizing the error.
Some fans believed it was a lucky fan who was invited onto or crashed the stage.
But there’s a reason that the face swap in particular has become an inescapable genre of viral image: Because it’s the perfect embodiment of our anxieties about technology growing in power and ability. When the face-swap filter works, it’s exciting and a little eerie. After all, the exact method through which Snapchat is able to transpose faces in real time is for all intents and purposes a black box of tech magic. Maybe it makes you, as it does me, slightly uncomfortable to think about how the device in your pocket is capable of automatically altering your appearance so completely and so realistically that you can be fooled, even for half a second, into thinking that your own face is in the right place on someone else’s body. The moment you realize something’s off — the moment you dive back down into the uncanny valley — is both unsettling and a little thrilling.
It makes sense, then, that we love the screwed-up face swap — those images where the program finds a face in an electrical socket or a stove burner — even more than the perfect one. On the one hand, it’s unnerving to see our faces treated as collections of pixels interchangeable with a variety of objects. And the objects the app tends to mistake for faces are telling: If an artist superimposed an electrical socket on someone’s face we’d call it clichéd; when a machine does it, it’s more than a little discomfiting.
But on the other, it can be a relief to know that, even though code is just a complex set of step-by-step instructions, it is still in some way fallible. It cannot yet fully approximate human technique and appearance.
At least, not yet.
Snapchat has made two incredibly smart business moves in the last year. The first was, obviously, enticing the Miami producer DJ Khaled to spend hours a day spouting his The Secret-like major keys (🔑) to success and getting lost on his Jet Ski. The second came last autumn, when the company acquired a Ukrainian start-up called Looksery to build out its wide slate of goofy, charming, and occasionally clunky lenses, which superimpose cartoonish effects onto users’ faces in real time. The most famous of these currently is the face swap, which (theoretically, under perfect conditions) will “swap” the faces of two people in a photograph or video.
The filters in general are extremely popular — not popular enough that people wanted to pay for them, but popular enough for Facebook to take notice and purchase a start-up doing brisk traffic in a face-swap app: MSQRD. (We wrote about MSQRD two months ago, when it was taking Russia by storm for a feature that allowed users to superimpose Stalin’s face onto theirs. It’s now among the most popular apps in the App Store.) Zuck announced the acquisition in an Iron Man face-swap video that he posted to his Facebook page:
The sudden rise of popularity in face-swap images is fascinating in part because they’ve always been a background part of the internet landscape, since at least the dawn of what we’ll call the “viral web” sometime in the 2000s. The premise is simple; as I say above, two people swap faces. Usually it’s funniest when the two people are dramatically different in age or appearance, like a baby and an adult. That’s funny. Thanks for letting me explain why something is funny. Like you, I enjoy comedy.
But if you wanted to make a competent face swap five or six years ago, you needed — at the very least — expensive photo-editing software and the skill to use it. The production of face swaps, until relatively recently, required some degree of financial means as well as expertise. Snapchat’s filter does away with all of that. Just get two faces in front of the lens and let the mysterious optical-recognition software work its magic. We now all have at all times, in our hands, the ability that was once the sole domain of the weird kid in class whose dad’s computer had Photoshop. More than anything else, this is behind the renaissance in face-swap images: Meme consumers are now meme producers.
The face swap isn’t the only instance of a once-niche meme made mainstream. Sites like Meme Generator and Quickmeme have long existed as factories and clearinghouses for producing instances of memes, as did the later Ragemaker.net. Web-native culture, in many ways, stems from these browser-based tools, creating homogeny. Memes democratize humor, but sites like these democratize their production.
More and more frequently, developers have realized that being the first to lower the technical barriers to meme creation can pay off in big ways. When Kanye West revealed the cover art for his latest album, The Life of Pablo, many quickly realized its meme potential — its template was simple and easily imitable. The unveiling also set off a very slight arms race to become the official unofficial TLOP cover generator. There was tlopcover.com, thepablo.life, and thelifeofpablol.com; all providing simple tools that West himself seemingly took advantage of. If you searched popular source-code repository Github, you could even find the resources to construct your own generator. We’re now firmly in a period where creating memes is not the only way to gain attention — the right tools to encourage their manufacture can also make or break a trend.
If we look at the current Facebook video economy as a precursor to Facebook’s text publishing economy, it’s easy to see it going not only off the rails but into the gutter. BuzzFeed (which is “all-in” on Instant Articles) lays out this scenario for freelancers (a.k.a. literally anyone):
Tons of large new media operations produce cool and slick videos on Facebook, and the viewership numbers are skyrocketing! Also skyrocketing: Low-quality rips of poorly compressed videos originally upload to Instagram (themselves stolen from Vine). The freebooting world of Facebook is largely untamed, and one might assume, decently profitable as well. It’s not hard to imagine the same going for Instant Articles as well.
For a small set of successful professionals, Instant Articles could become a full-time source of income (possibly, in the beginning, subsidized and encouraged to post on Facebook … by Facebook). For existing media organizations, it calms them as to anxieties regarding Facebook’s industry-eating ambitions. And for everyone else, it offers yet another way to share other people’s work and reap the benefit.
Update: This post has been updated to reflect that at least one New York vertical is on Instant Articles.
Good news for content creators: Facebook announced this week that it will soon roll out its Instant Articles platform to everyone.
Instant Articles, of course, are stories and articles and blog posts hosted on Facebook itself. Currently only available to a handful of institutional publishers — BuzzFeed, National Geographic, and the New York Times among them — Instant Articles theoretically improve a publication’s readership metrics simply by loading significantly faster. When a reader clicks through a link to an Instant Article on your Facebook feed — say, a Washington Post article — she’ll be taken to a minimally branded page that loads much more quickly than the article would on the Post’s own website. (For some perspective, 10 seconds qualifies as a long load time.) The Post keeps all revenue from advertising it sells itself on that article; extra inventory is sold on Facebook’s ad network at a 70/30 split between the Post and Facebook, respectively.
By opening up Instant Articles to everyone, Facebook is hoping to grow not only as a leading sourcing of web referral traffic, but as a first-party home to content itself. With Instant Articles, Facebook is offering publishers a 70 percent cut of ad revenue. And anyone can be a publisher. (New York’s Science of Us blog is a participant, "potentially with more of our sites to come," I was informed.)
By offering some theoretical revenue to writers who might otherwise put their writing for free on another platform, Facebook hopes to attract more original content — and, BuzzFeed writes, undertake “an effort to bring more quality content to its platform, similar to the way YouTube’s revenue-share program is responsible for bringing talented creators to its site.”
This is an interesting comparison. Has YouTube’s revenue-share program really been responsible for bringing talented creators to its site? (Talented creators besides BuzzFeed’s enormous video operation, I mean.) There’s a very small class of extraordinarily successful vloggers, most of them appealing to a young audience. But there’s a larger middle class of vloggers and web series, whose struggles to break even, let alone profit, from their videos and series has been the subject of articles and profiles for years.
And there’s an enormous lumpen-proletariat class of mostly invisible channels made by people ripping clips from TV news, or uploading entire movies, or “freebooting” — stealing clips from Vine, YouTube, Instagram, or other channels and re-uploading them on their own channel.
Why wouldn’t Facebook’s Instant Articles end up the same way? Surely there is a handful of people with voices that will attract enough readers on Facebook to make a good living writing for it. And likely there will be a lot of writers who are currently posting for free to Twitter or Tumblr or Medium who might move to Facebook just to pick up the small amount of revenue it might provide them. And then there will be thousands of terrible pages simply copying and pasting news articles, listicles, humor pieces, and other highly shareable bits of fluff — run by the kind of people who recognize that for the amount of money you’re likely to make off of programmatic Facebook display ads, there’s little profit in writing original content.
In fact, we can get a kind of preview of the effect of open Instant Articles by looking at the way Facebook has tried to compete with YouTube — by providing better tools for hosting video on Facebook itself. (And by promoting Facebook-native videos more visibly.) It’s not pretty.
If you don’t find it funny, it may be because you are old, and the joke registers at a particularly teenage pitch. Nevertheless, here’s a helpful breakdown.
Fuck: Sex, generally speaking, is funny.
Me: Making such a bold proposal, publicly and on social media, is funny.
Daddy: Okay, this one is slightly more complicated, but it has to do with the group of sexual hang-ups generally known as “daddy issues,” which are uncomfortable for some and, by proxy, funny.
There you have it: Fuck Me Daddy, explained.
Trump has not yet responded to The New Republic’s offer.
Earlier today, the liberal journal of ideas The New Republic tweeted an extremely liberal idea from its official Twitter account:
Yes, that’s TNR tweeting “Fuck me daddy” at leading GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.
The tweet, which has since been deleted, was composed by writer Patricia Lockwood, who had recently written an enormously enjoyable profile of Trump and his supporters for the publication. “[W]ell that was fun while it lasted,” she wrote shortly afterward on her personal account.
“I hoped he would mistake it for a quote of his, and retweet it with extreme approbation,” Lockwood said when reached over Twitter DM.
For people familiar with TNR and Trump, but not the mores and customs of Twitter, the tweet may be baffling. Why do this? Well, there are many complicated reasons — some social, some political, some economic, some at the intersection of all these fields and many more — ha ha, no, I’m kidding. Teenagers tweeting sexually explicit requests at celebrities has become something of a running gag on Twitter. As Max Read wrote back in February:
Teens particularly love to tweet it at the Pope, who is celibate.

Babies are the biggest thing on Instagram that isn’t food, pets, or selfies, so it’s only fitting that the generation that will document its children’s entire lives on the photo-sharing site is now naming those children after photo filters. If you had a kid in 2015, you can expect them to go to kindergarten with a Ludwig, an Amaro, or a Valencia.

BabyCenter’s worldwide survey of 340,000 parents found that the most popular names for newborns this year were Sophia and Jackson, but it also noted an uptick in Insta-names.

In some cases — like Brooklyn’s — it’s impossible to measure for the effect of Instagram because the name belonged to an established person or place before it became a filter. In other cases, it’s painfully easy — so, good luck to the baby born in 2016 who will be named Charmes. You’re going to need it.
“One newer filter, Ludwig, jumped 42 percent on our boys’ name list. Other popular filter names for boys include Amaro (up 26 percent), Reyes (up 10 percent), Hudson (up 4 percent), and Kelvin (up 3 percent),” the website reported.
Lux, the name of the photo-enhancement button Instagram introduced back in 2012, also jumped 75 percent for boys and a small percentage for girls.
But other Instagram filters weren’t as popular with new parents: Sierra, Walden, and Lark were all down, BabyCenter reported. Fortunately (unfortunately?), there was no report of a baby named X-Pro II, but it’s probably only a matter of time.
BabyCenter didn’t provide a complete chart of the software children of our future-present, so I went through the data and compiled this list of Instagram-filter baby names, ranked by popularity. (All data via BabyCenter, number of babies per 1 million.) The Insta-names might be trending, but they haven’t reached epidemic proportions — yet.

Also, semi-relatedly, Trump hates Steve Jobs’s yacht:
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has called for a boycott of Apple products in the wake of the company’s refusal to help the government unlock a phone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. Trump’s anger, like that of most Republican candidates, stems from a sense that refusing to help the FBI is tantamount to helping terrorists.
Trump himself has a long history with the company — not limited to the fact that he owns and tweets from an iPhone, and owns a significant amount of Apple stock. In 2013, he (repeatedly) criticized the company for dragging its heels on introducing a larger screen size.
He later claimed, in early 2014, to have dumped his stock.
Surprisingly, Trump was not, precisely, telling the truth, as we understand it: Now that he’s a presidential candidate, Trump has had to disclose many of his business interests; as it turns out, the master of the art of the deal still holds at least a million dollars in Apple stock.
He is also still tweeting from an iPhone.
If you weren’t acutely aware of the crushing, silent private- and governmental-surveillance system keeping an eye on us at all times of the day, then how you take this news will depend on your feelings on the relative benevolence of Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook’s ever-expanding data-collection regime is probably tracking your sleep habits. But don’t worry — the data is public, so you can watch your friends sleep, too!
Danish developer Søren Louv-Jansen, used Messenger.com, Facebook’s stand-alone web version of the chat feature, to create a tool that makes rough maps of what his friends’ sleep schedules look like based on the “Active [x] hours ago” data Messenger.com provides. The idea is that since many people check Facebook just before bed and right when they wake up, knowing how long a person has been inactive on the service can give you a good sense of their sleep habits. Simply by going into the markup of Messenger.com, which is publicly available (if not the easiest to find), Louv-Jansen was able to build accurate depictions of what time his Facebook friends went to sleep and woke up.
It’s important to note that it’s not that Facebook is intentionally or specifically tracking your sleeping habits — it’s just that when you combine extensive data collection with a total captive user base, you can build a very accurate picture of a person’s life. (Remember a few years ago, when it came out that Facebook can predict with high accuracy your sexuality, among other things?) The tool only works assuming your friends open Facebook around when they wake up, and stop using it around when they go to sleep — in an interview with the Washington Post, Louv-Jansen said the tool works “extremely well” for 30 percent of his friends, and “somewhat effectively” on the rest.
Louv-Jansen told the Post that he’d been tinkering with the tool for months, before and after seeing a similar idea posted on Hacker News, but only made the tool available on GitHub in late December and didn’t publicize it until writing a Medium post last week. Facebook, apparently wanting to keep any and all nongovernmental spying over its websites internal, told Louv-Jansen that he was violating its terms of service and to take the tool off of GitHub. He’s refused thus far, telling the Post, “I’m not proud of people starting to spy on their friends, but maybe this can make everybody more aware of the consequences of our actions.” Rest easy!
Watch the below video, currently circulating Facebook, of a Tickle-Me Elmo getting burnt to a crisp by a jet engine, and be aware that you are in the presence of the the birth of a new meme. Elmo getting burnt to a crisp by a jet engine is TFW you accidentally double-tap an 88-week-old photo on Instagram. Elmo getting burnt to a crisp is Me Talking to an Ex. Elmo getting burnt to a crisp is spending ten minutes on Facebook. Elmo getting burnt to a crisp is the online experience, where you are Elmo, the jet engine is the internet, and the exhaust is memes and opinions.
An Australian customer-service bloke earned praise from around the world after he delivered some extremely sick — yet also extremely polite — burns to bigoted Facebook commenters who had a problem with his company’s policy of communicating with customers in their native languages.
Many re-blogs and offers of marriage followed, but the man known only as “Dan” remained a mystery. Optus told reporters they wouldn’t let Dan do any interviews, but news.com.au skipped the middleman. They found the Facebook page of one Dan de Sousa, whose friends were publicly praising him for being great at his job.
Although they weren’t able to speak to him, news.com.au concluded that “Dan is not just well mannered and well educated, he runs his own film production company and is heavily involved in the Australian hip hop scene.”
No matter that he’s not doing interviews; Dan’s work speaks for itself. Good on you, mate.
Optus, Australia’s second-largest telecom company, recently started using multilingual signs to let customers know they could ask to speak to a representative in their own languages. It’s a nice idea, but Australia is right up there with the U.S. in terms of virulent racism. Seeing signs in Arabic triggered a spree of bigoted, “English-only” yelling on the company’s Facebook page.
Into the breach stepped Optus Dan, the hero customer service deserves. He gently disarmed the complainers with his words, explaining in the clearest terms that Australia is a multicultural country with no official language, and that the signs were placed in neighborhoods with many Arabic speakers who would find them helpful. Optus did the same for other languages.
Witness Dan bravely winning hearts and minds in a situation that would cause many of us to quit in frustration:
There is a QR-code system by which you can share your Mii’s appearance, but that just adds a look-alike to your collection. It doesn’t actually add a friend.
What’s the social aspect?Miitomo asks you a lot of questions. It’s basically like posting prepackaged status updates. Here’s my favorite food, here’s what I did over the weekend, here are my wildest dreams, and so on and so forth.
The other great part of Miitomo is the photo tool. You can pose you Mii in a bunch of goofy poses against a bunch of cutesy backgrounds (or import custom ones from the photos on your phone) and share them on Miitomo and other social networks. It’s kind of like Bitstrips, only a lot less schmaltzy.
It feels like a backdoor entry into data mining.Though it’s not presented in the standard feed format, Miitomo feels like a proto-social network, and its Q&A format has the shape of a data-collection operation if you take a few steps back and squint real hard. But Nintendo has been so inept for so long when it comes to online functionality that I wouldn’t be alarmed. I don’t think they can data-mine their way out of a wet paper bag.
There’s basically nothing you can’t say on Miitomo.The most glaring omission from the app is any sort of text filtering, meaning that users can type anything they want. For instance, one of the very first questions that the app asked me was about the current events I was interested in.
When your friends visit, you can offer custom greetings and salutations. Here are mine.
Finally, the day has arrived. Miitomo is here! Miitomo, the hot new app! There are lots of popular apps, and today that app is Miitomo.
On top of all of this, Mii text is converted into robotic speech, which means that when I told Miitomo that fascism was becoming popular, this is what got read in a Stephen Hawking–esque timbre.
Nintendo’s lack of filtering is somewhat surprising given how reluctant it’s always been to build any sort of open online service. It’s usually almost militant in making its products safe for young children. The greater latitude on Miitomo, if I had to guess, is probably due to how difficult it is to add people as friends in the first place.
The app is free, but there are microtransactions.Yeah. You earn coins with which to buy new clothes slowly, but you can pay real money to get a bunch of coins. It’s all cosmetic and pretty harmless, but I bet it’ll make Nintendo a ton of money.
It seems harmless.If you’re on the fence about Miitomo, then, yeah, why not give it a spin? It’s free, and wacky, and probably good for a laugh or two. I’m enjoying dressing my virtual self up in a hot-dog costume to talk about ISIS.
Miitomo is Nintendo’s first app.Miitomo, pronounced “mee-toh-moh,” is available on iOS and Android in the United States as of today. It’s been out in Japan for a couple of weeks.
Sales for Nintendo’s hardware, the Wii U and the Nintendo 3DS, have been lagging, and the company is looking at other ways to make money. Specifically, it’s translating some of its most well-known properties to mobile phones. Later this year, it’s releasing a Pokemon game. For now, though, it’s just dipping its toes in the water with Miitomo.
Miitomo is like a goofier version of the Sims.I hesitate to call Miitomo a game. It’s a program in which you create a virtual avatar of yourself. Nintendo refers to them as Miis. They’ve been around for a decade, ever since the original Wii was released. They’re cute! People have been messing around with Miis for years, styling them to look like celebrities or using other games to have them say heinous things.
In Miitomo, you use your Mii to walk around a single room and visit your friends, also presented in Mii form. You answer small-talk conversation-starter questions about yourself. You earn coins that can then be used to buy new, goofy outfits, and accessories. That’s it; it’s pretty simple.
Adding friends is needlessly complicated.Yeeeeaaaahhh … that’s the thing. Nintendo is notoriously terrible at designing online systems. There isn’t even a username system by which you can add friends. There are three ways: via Facebook, via Twitter (you have to be following each other), and via being in physical proximity to another user. It’s kind of garbage, because you have to already be linked in some other way.
It’s quirky, but it kind of makes sense. And more than 40,000 subscribers on YouTube are understandably fascinated with it. The world can feel scary and broken a lot of the time, especially filtered through the cynical internet, so watching a friendly woman (well, a friendly woman’s hands) build and squish gummy food is a pleasant diversion.
What’s so great about this video of a bottle of blue Powerade sports drink? Everything, really. Let’s start with this: It’s actually a giant gelatin-based gummy candy that looks exactly like a blue Powerade. It’s edible, you can slice it with a knife, and it’s just one of the weird, hypercute things you’ll find on a weird, hypercute YouTube channel called Fluff Berry Puff.
Fluff Berry Puff might be Korean, based on the titles of her YouTube videos, but it’s hard to tell for sure, because she never shows her face and she never speaks. She just silently shows viewers how to make giant gummy Coke bottles, gummy Starbucks tea cups, edible Nutella Play-Doh, and milk pudding inside a milk carton.
Fluff Berry Puff’s Candyland aesthetic is defined by soft, brightly colored food products, bright-pink backgrounds, and painted nails. In this way, she’s got a lot in common with the soothing toy-unboxing videos that dominate the competition for kids’ attention on YouTube.
Fluff Berry Puff does some toy-unboxing of her own, mostly favoring Thomas the Tank Engine and a series of food-making toys called Yummy Nummies. She also really liked this huge turtle that expands in water:
Facebook tries to comply with government requests to restrict illegal content. In the first half of 2015, it restricted 188 pieces of content in Germany for Holocaust denial or “incitement of hatred.” Facebook also tries to enforce its own community standards, which prohibit violent threats, as well as attacks on people based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disabilities or diseases. “The community standards are fine,” says Baldauf. “Our problem is how they really bring those community standards into reality.” Baldauf estimates that only 5 percent of the comments that he has reported to Facebook as potential hate speech have been removed, and that removal often seems to be arbitrary.
Facebook hasn’t helped itself by revealing very little about how its system for flagging and removing offensive content actually works. The company claims that it receives over a million reports from around the world every day and has also said that all German reports are reviewed by a native speaker. Otherwise it has shared few details. In August, Reinbold joined other German journalists at Facebook’s headquarters in Ireland to discuss hate speech and walked away unimpressed. “One finds in Dublin no evidence for Facebook’s assertion that its system for dealing with hate works well,” he wrote.
Facebook recognizes that if it wants to continue doing brisk business in Germany, it will need to acknowledge that the country has different moderation and speech needs. Representatives announced in November a partnership German NGOs and government agencies, including the Voluntary Self-Monitoring of Multimedia Service Providers (FSM), which already helps Google and YouTube comply with German law. “We’re going to act as a counsel for Facebook, tell them what our experience[s] show in the last years [about] how to handle those reports and to make their internal process for Germany more effective,” says FSM’s Managing Director Otto Vollmers.
Befitting its status as a tech company, it also has a semi-technological solution: Facebook has said it wants to “introduce” to Germany what it it calls “counter speech.” The idea is simple enough: Facebook wants to make sure that people who seek out extremist material on its service are also presented with more positive and contrary viewpoints as well. “When we’re talking about counter-speech, we’re talking about targeting individuals on the basis of their likes, on their patterns of online usage,” says Erin Saltman, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. Google already gives some NGOs vouchers to purchase ad words, and activists like Baldauf think it could be a valuable tool in fighting extremism online.
But counter speech also requires Germans to let up on their resistance to some of the data-profiling that enrages them when done by advertisers. Facebook might at least be encouraged to see Germans treating the social network as a reflection of their society rather than just some tool on the Internet. “The way Germans use Facebook has changed a lot in recent years,” says Reinbold. “We mostly used it for posting pictures of your private life and not as a form of public debate.”
It’s hard not to feel at least a little sympathy for Facebook. For years Germany demanded that the social network butt out of its citizens’ business and now it is demanding that it police them better. And Facebook is understandably wary of taking down content on government requests. “We fight to protect our community from unnecessary or overreaching government intervention,” Zuckerberg said earlier this year.
One imagines the company would happily help European governments root out hate speech if it meant European governments would be less protective of their citizens’ data — although one imagines also that Ott would rather not be a sacrificial lamb. Facebook has said Jun’s complaint “lacks merit,” but it also appears to be taking him more seriously before. Since his complaint became public, Jun says Facebook has become more responsive to his reports. Of the first 109 reports he filed, 80 have now been removed.
In mid-October, a German lawyer named Chan-Jo Jun filed a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor in Hamburg. Jun practiced IT law in the old Bavarian city of Wurzburg, and he typically handled issues like software license compliance. “Boring stuff basically,” he says. Jun’s new complaint, though, was unlike any that he or any other German lawyer had ever filed.
Jun had recently logged onto Facebook and reported more than sixty anti-refugee postings as hate speech. The comments ranged from slurs like Dreck (dirt) and Schwein (pig) to violent threats and images to outright Holocaust nostalgia (“There’s plenty of space for them in my oven,” one user wrote). “Incitement to hatred” is a crime in Germany, but Jun wasn’t particularly interested in punishing the men and women who had shared their ugly thoughts online. Rather, Jun asked the prosecutor to investigate Facebook’s managing director for Northern, Central, and Eastern Europe, a man named Martin Ott.
The anti-refugee sentiment that Jun wanted to extinguish has exploded after ISIS’s attack on Paris, not just in Europe but in the United States as well. Xenophobia has concentrated especially on social media, where like-minded people from violent radicals to mainstream nationalists can coordinate, share, and exchange ideas. Most people in the U.S., with its relatively weak state and strong free speech traditions, seem willing to give companies like Facebook a pass. Hate is, in this case, the cost of doing business. But Germany has seen the worst excesses of both populist nationalism and state repression, and is ill-inclined to shrug its shoulders at either hate speech or privacy violations. Instead, it’s taking an aggressive approach, weighing speech and privacy rights against the horrible legacy of the 20th century as it tries to force Facebook to take responsibility for the ugliness on its servers.
In Germany, service providers like Facebook are liable for illegal content that they do not remove expeditiously after they’ve been notified of its existence. The law typically comes up around pirated movies or music, but Jun did not see why it should not extend as well to hate speech. “I’m not interested in seeing people in jail who make stupid or criminal comments,” Jun says. Rather, he argued to the German prosecutor, Ott was personally liable, since he oversaw the company’s community operations in Germany. Before filing his complaint, Jun had even printed the offensive comments and sent them by certified mail to Ott’s private home in Hamburg, in order to establish intent. (“I assume his wife opened it,” he says.) He expected Facebook would simply remove the material in order to fend off an investigation, but a few days later most of it remained. “I had my case for the prosecutor,” Jun says.
Germany has prosecuted several people for hateful Facebook postings, but Jun wanted to force the social network to take direct responsibility by bringing pressure to bear on its individual employees. “Facebook thought I was just an annoying lawyer who’s trying to be important,” he says, but his zeal was rewarded this month when the Hamburg prosecutor announced it had opened an official investigation. Now Ott, if charged and convicted, could serve time in prison.
Ott’s imprisonment would be anathema in the United States, where Facebook users tend to see the social network as a haven of free speech. “In an ideal world, we would all feel empowered to express everything we want, freely and safely,” Mark Zuckerberg wrote in March. But freedom and safety conflict as often as they complement each other, and democratic countries must weigh trade-offs that private companies like Facebook can easily elide. Germany was more welcoming of refugees this summer than just about any other other nation, but the country also experienced a surge in right-wing violence. In August, neo-Nazis converged on a shelter in Heidenau, intimidating the refugees and hurling bottles and firecrackers at police. Germany civil society had worked hard since the Nazi era to stigmatize far-right viewpoints in political debate, so it shocked people to see images of violent demonstrations. “Many Germans are used to someone dealing with this problem for them,” says Johannes Baldauf, the director of No-Nazi.net, “but most civil society doesn’t understand how social media is working.”
Since Facebook launched in Germany in 2010, the country has hassled the social network with lawsuits and regulations. But the main concern has generally been privacy, not hate speech — another legacy of the Nazi and East German surveillance states. Facebook is, by far, the largest social network in the country, but the German government has insisted on legal limits on data tracking and the right of its citizens to sign up under a pseudonym. “Germany is very modern when it comes to treating privacy rights as human rights,” says Markus Beckedahl, the editor of NetzPolitik.org.
The preoccupation with personal privacy, though, also led many Germans to overlook how the country’s long-dormant far-right was using Facebook to mobilize. The anti-Islam movement Pegida, for example, gathered more Facebook followers in little over a year than any German political party. “In these instances, you could see a direct link between how they organized on Facebook and how they took to the streets,” says Fabian Reinbold, a journalist who covers technology for Der Spiegel. A few days after the Heidenau attack, Germany’s justice minister Heiko Maas insisted that the company “abide by German laws.” Then, at a U.N. luncheon in September, a live microphone caught Chancellor Angela Merkel asking Zuckerberg what Facebook was doing to curtail hate speech. “We need to do some work,” he conceded.
Maybe they’re not bringing kriti back all on their own, but it’s a pretty good start.
Last month, technology websites were unnecessarily excited to find that Apple’s Siri, the virtual personal assistant that haunts all iPhones, had been programmed to beatbox. That’s fine, nerds, but your rudimentary “boots and cats” Easter egg has nothing on what these three South Indian kids living in Dubai made Siri do.
Siri never needed “boots and cats” to drop a beat, she just needed to be asked “What is one trillion to the tenth power?” And over that beat, three Dubai radio station employees made classical Indian music, a form they worried was going extinct, cool again.
That’s Carl La’Frenais as the human beatbox, Puja Unni adding the “thaka dimi tha,” and Pavritha Menon singing “Endaro Mahanubhavulu” — a famous composition in the history of Carnatic music, one of South India’s classical forms. The composer, Tyagaraja, is a legend of the form, and part of what’s known as the Trinity of Carnatic music.
Not exactly the kind of thing you’d expect to blow up on the internet, perhaps. La’Frenais didn’t expect it to, either.
“The fact that Indian classical music is dying out was the main reason why we decided to do this version in the traditional style. We didn’t think it would go viral the way it did,” he told the Deccan Chronicle.
But the trio’s modern spin on the song was an immediate hit on Twitter, and it ended up being viewed 10 million times over two days as it spread to Facebook and YouTube.
The one particular problem that over-the-internet therapy seems primed to solve is the question of access. Before she started work with Talkspace as a telehealth therapist and then head of Clinical Development, Nicole Amesbury was working in psychiatry practice, hospital counseling, and acute psychiatric care. “I saw the common problems that were keeping people from getting therapy,” she said. “Stigma, affordability, or they just couldn’t get to the clinic, they couldn’t stay long enough because of the cost.”
Dr. April Foreman has been studying text-message-based or technologically assisted therapy for much of her career. As a psychiatrist working in rural Kansas, Foreman encountered numerous patients who had to drive long distances to make their appointments. That made it hard for her to build relationships with new patients while continuing to work with existing patients.
More than half of the counties in America are entirely without mental-health professionals, according to the director of the National Institute of Mental Health. “It’s a luxury service to get to my office,” Foreman told me. “It assumes you have transportation, spare time, no competing problems you would have to solve — how to get gas, how to drive in rural Kansas for two hours — and that only works for people who have disposable income and cars that work and lots of spare time.”
That’s also spare time on the part of the provider. With the demand for mental-health professionals on the rise, Dr. Foreman predicts the conventional model of visit-the-office, lie-on-the-couch therapy could actually hold clinicians back from helping as many patients as possible. “If we took every licensed mental health professional, and we employed them at the top of their license, full-time, and they did nothing but high-risk care for adults, they would have to see 50 to 60 patients a year,” she said. “That would be your whole caseload.”
That sounds a bit like the sharing economy’s promise (or threat) to make more efficient use of your time — as an Uber driver, or Taskrabbit worker, say — and it’s true that mental health, as a field, is experiencing the same kind of disruptive pressure other industries are. As more and more psychology schools incorporate “wired” programming into their curriculums, and more and more therapy app ads flood Facebook feeds with online therapy, it’s becoming an option the psychology community has to embrace.
For some people, this is great. After previous experiences with a life coach who charged $100 to talk about relationship issues, Katie Hart Morse wanted an option that offered her more time, more affordability, and most important, more control of the conversation. She turned to Talkspace.
“When I’m in a therapy session, you get bogged down on one topic when you really also wanted to talk about one topic,” she said. “And then you’re like, ‘Shit, there went 100 bucks.’ So for me, it was definitely being able to get all my thoughts out and I also think more bang for my buck.”
But a better question than “do therapy apps work?” might be “what would ‘work’ mean?” These new apps and online therapy services are making big promises — 7 Cups offers free compassion, Koko bills itself as “a social network that actually calms your mind,” and Therapy calls its program “therapy how we live today.” But none of them can eradicate the larger structural problems destroying the system: the high cost of help, the crippling sense of stigma, and the critical shortage of mental-health professionals in rural areas.
If anything, the idea of a quick-fix, app-based solution could undermine the case for rigorous, consistent therapy for the people who need it. In-person therapy involves time. The therapist gets to know the patient, and gets to know the kind of therapy the patient prefers. The patient also needs time: time to warm up to the therapist, time to vocalize an issue or problem. And, even more important, time off from work and life to get to and from therapy appointments on a weekly basis.
But also the time to feel better. Online and off.
Getting into therapy is a big deal. You have to confront your own internal turmoil. You have to research therapists and counselors and group sessions. You have to budget the money to pay for it. You figure out if you’re a “chair” or a “couch” person.
Or — a set of investors, app developers, and doctors are hoping — you just download and fire up an app on your phone.
“If we were to design therapy today, we’d think about using technology today — because therapy is laborious,” says Glen Moriarty. Moriarty is the founder of 7 Cups of Tea, one of the most prominent apps in a burgeoning industry referred to by a host of neologisms nearly as unappealing as SSRI trademarks: online therapy, “telehealth,” “e-therapy” (one imagines “iShrink” is around the corner).
Some resemble social networks: 7 Cups of Tea and Koko group you anonymously with volunteer listeners for a group discussion on how, what, and why you’re feeling. Others are virtual exercises that provide a supplement — or in some cases, even an alternative — to in-person counseling: Talkspace and Joyable connect you directly to coaches or therapists for text sessions, thought exercises, and 1-1 messaging. As Talkspace co-founder Roni Frank told CNN: “It’s like WhatsApp, with a therapist.” (Points, we suppose, for not going with the far easier “Uber for therapy.”) Some charge by the month or by the session. Others are free to download.
The first question everyone asks, of course, is: Do any of them actually work? Silicon Valley has a history of offering (literally) press-button “solutions” to problems whose sources are systemic and intractable. Mental-health therapy can be a rigorous and taxing experience — not least because the problems it’s meant to address are by definition deep-seated.
The short answer, as usual, is “it’s complicated.” For some people, a few texts exchanged with volunteers can actually mimic the same emotional development as you see from an IRL relationship with a counselor. An October 2015 study in the Journal of Mental Health reported users viewed the volunteer “emotional support” programs like 7 Cups of Tea as “genuine” displays of empathy.
Moriarty compared it to the Alcoholics Anonymous model — an addict receives help from other addicts, and then turns around to assist others in recovery. “You’re essentially paying careful attention, you’re practicing empathy,” Moriarty said. “You’re imagining, ‘If I was this person, what would I be thinking and feeling?’ and you try to say that back to that person. The curative thing in therapy is called the therapeutic alliance — it’s that process, of feeling like the therapist cares about you.”
But for people dealing with mental-health issues involving addiction or abuse or self-harm, an app can’t make up for in-person check-ins. As one doctor told the New York Times, “If I’m treating an alcoholic, I can’t smell his breath over Skype.” And the American Psychological Association is still developing guidelines to uniform telehealth practice across states, and not all insurance programs offer reimbursement for online services.
A man on the lam from Ohio police saw the photo they’d posted of him on Facebook — in which he wears a cheesy grin and looks for all the world like a down-on-his-luck Carlton Banks — and decided he had to do something about it. Turn himself in? Of course not. He texted them a dapper selfie they could use in their Facebook bulletin about him, along with the message “Here is a better photo that one is terrible.”
Nice, nice.
Donald “Chip” Pugh, 45, is being sought for failure to appear after a drunk-driving incident, and Lima, Ohio, police also note he’s a person of interest in “several other cases including an arson and vandalism.” The initial photo they posted of him definitely made him look like a man who goes by “Chip,” while the new pic he sent in was more befitting of a “Donald.” Or a “Tony Montana.” That suit! Those sunglasses!
Police seem to think Pugh has more vanity than brains, calling what he did “not very smart.”
“We thank him for being helpful, but now we would appreciate it if he would come speak to us at the LPD about his charges,” Lieutenant Andy Green of the Lima PD told NBC Chicago.
“I don’t know why he did that,” Green added.
Pugh has told police he’s out of the state, NBC Chicago reported, but the police do not believe him.
There is one exception to this rule, though, and it’s when I watch LeJuan James videos. This is when I feel totally and absolutely Latina.
Atiles’s Instagram videos have made the 26-year-old a celebrity in the Latin-American internet sphere, with millions of followers across his various platforms (he started out on Vine, then moved to Facebook and Instagram). Over the phone, he plays it down: “I don’t care too much about the whole publicity [and] fame thing — I just want to be successful,” he told me. Most of what he does is similar in form to the “Towels” video — ten-second skits starring himself, sometimes with his mom, Ingrid (who goes by the genius handle @lemomjames online), or his girlfriend, YouTube influencer Camila (@camilaainc), which broadly and goofily dramatize situations familiar to many Spanish-speaking households in the U.S. There’s “the Hispanic speech every time we go out,” and “When Hispanic parents catch you listening to music they don’t like,” and “The awkward moment when you’re at your [white] friend house and they start arguing with their parents.”
The situations at hand aren’t by any means exclusive to Hispanic families — similar conversations have occurred in the homes of people of all backgrounds — but they highlight the way Hispanic parents grapple with raising their second-generation American children in a country whose society’s familial and cultural values so vastly differ from their own. Aside from the fact that, well, they’re in Spanish, Atiles nails the cultural tropes, props, and characters familiar to Latin-American families — there are the obvious ones, like the overdramatic mother, the bata, and the chancleta.
But Atiles also calls upon other, more subtle ones like Old World phrases (“que buena vida,” “te voy a dar,” “estas canas que yo tengo en la cabeza son por sabia, no por vieja”), and tiny idiosyncrasies like the way your abuela might rather blatantly lie to your face than be caught feeling embarrassed about falling asleep while watching the TV, or how your mother cannot sleep until you make it home. They often highlight (and poke fun at) moments when a parent overreacts to situations that a second-generation Hispanic child would not find irritating, like slurping to get the last sip of your soft drink, which, to many Latin mothers, is considered incredibly rude.
After seeing the towel video, which I immediately sent to my mom, my sister, my aunt, and, like, four cousins, I sat there watching video after video of Atiles’s, virtually in shock by how spot-on every single skit felt to me. On “Hispanics when you leave a mess in the bathroom pt 1,” 15,000 other people commented underneath the video, presumably feeling the same exact awe I felt:

In 2016, if you want to tell someone a joke, you tag them in an Instagram meme. A few months ago, my cousin tagged me in this video, commenting, “wait. cuz. do u know LeJuan?”:

One of the oddest developments in the field of jokes in the digital age has been the extent to which “relatability” and “humor” have become identified with one another. Think about the way jokes spread on Instagram: When we share memes and videos by tagging our friends in the comments, we’re not just saying “this is funny,” but also “I think you’ll find this funny,” or, at least, “I think you’ll find this laughing-so-hard-I’m-crying emoji.” You don’t tag your friend who loves cats in this @fuckjerry post about a dog begging for food all the time: Before sharing the joke, you stop to consider which one of your friends will get the joke first. So much of this kind of humor — the kind that’s highly shareable — is about drawing boundaries around groups: I think back to middle school, when my friends and I would post inside jokes we had with one another on our Hometown AOL sites for other people to read and not understand — proof to the rest of the world that we could create our own community. Meme accounts like @fuckjerry or @beigecardigan or @daquan are similarly communal: Do you relate to this? Which of your friends does? Who is in this club? Essentially, they’re inside jokes that work inclusively instead of exclusively.
Throughout high school and college, I was not actively connected to a Latino community in my everyday life: My suburban neighborhood was predominantly white, and I would say more than half of my graduating class, and most of my friends, were white. I was identified by my classmates and my teachers as white, with “Latina” relegated to the status of fun-fact trivia — “Did you know Christina is half-Panamanian?” I was uncomfortable with the way my peers played down the Latina part of my identity, but I rode that wave for a while because it felt like the only wave to ride. One time in high school, when I arrived at a house party in a bad mood after a particularly incensed fight with my mom about my curfew, which was much earlier than any of my friends’, my white friend looked at me sympathetically after I told her why I was late and she said, “Don’t worry. She just doesn’t get that you are one of us.”
One of whom, though? I do find myself in Atiles’s videos, like the one about your Hispanic parents giving you consejos. If you grew up with a Latin parent, you probably gawked at your white friends rolling up to school in Old Navy flip-flops. You probably felt mad uncomfortable watching your white friend disrespect her mother while you were over at her house, and thought how if you spoke to your mother that way you would probably be, like, struck dead. The humor in “relatability” and identity-defining memes lies in their ability not just to resurrect a situation or feeling that specific, that intimate to you alone, but also to establish that the experience is shared — a realization that can bring a deep comfort, if not joy. On the internet, we value communal jokes, but crave to be on the inside — to belong, to be able to @ someone in a post as if to say, “Totally, right?” Past the exclusivity, past the good feeling that goes along with getting the joke, through Atiles I felt that sense of belonging, a connection to the Latin part of my identity and to the Latino community that had been absent in my life for a long time.
Atiles is a second-generation 25-year-old, one of the millions of second-generation Hispanics growing up in the U.S. today. Some understand Spanish but don’t speak it, and some don’t understand it or speak it at all. Many identify as Hispanic, but also identify with another ethnicity or sub-ethnicity. Second-gen Latinos and Latinas are on the internet — we engage in dialogues about Latin culture and feminism, Latin culture and homosexuality; we contend with the way our parents were raised and the world we live in. Atiles’s Facebook analytics, which he shared with me, show that 1.3 million out of his 2 million Facebook fans are English speakers primarily — only about 200,000, the second-highest tier, list Spanish as their main language. That’s proof that his work hits home most for second-generation Latinos whose parents moved here from Latin American countries — connecting Hispanic-Americans with their Hispanic roots. “That’s why my captions are in English,” Atiles explained to me over the phone. “[There are people who can] understand the joke, even if the language is in Spanish.”
I think this is part of what makes Atiles such a standard-bearer online for Latino identity: He spotlights the Hispanic parents grappling with the new world their children are growing up in, without diminishing their experiences. He describes reactions he receives as “genuine engagement — people feel like they know me as a friend.” Atiles says a large chunk of his fans are parents themselves — and the videos are for them, too. My mom, for one, adores him.
I am 27 now, and my mother will still become freakishly focused on superficial things like my appearance. A few months ago, she didn’t like the way I had put my hair up on the top of my head when I met my dad and her for dinner. She sat on this feeling for two days before calling me to let me know she had been feeling “really depressed” thinking about how little I cared about my appearance in public. She told me how, if I ever wanted to find a good husband, I’d need to start taking pride in my hair, for the love of God. She made me promise that por favor, que nadie te ve con ese pelo asi … Piensa en tu madre, y en dios que te dio ese pelo … Bueno …
There is a LeJuan video about that. I didn’t let it get to me. I just laughed.
“LeJuan James” is the nombre de usuario of dominicano and puertorriqueño comedian Juan Atiles. The caption on the Instagram video my cousin tagged me in reads, “Hispanics Parents when you leave a mess in the Bathroom. Pt.1 ‘Towels.’” It depicts Atiles, a bearded man in his 20s, impersonating an older woman, presumably a mother figure, after someone off-camera has used the “wrong” hand towels to dry their hands on — despite the fact that the hand towel he’s referring to looks like the only towel in the bathroom with which to dry your hands. It has tens of thousands of likes and shares on Instagram and Facebook, and counting.
If you don’t speak Spanish, you still might’ve laughed — the caption is in English, and Atiles is an excellent physical comedian, with Will Ferrell–esque facial expressions and El Chavo del Ocho–level timing. If you do speak Spanish, and especially if you grew up with Spanish-speaking parents from Latin America, “Hispanic Parents when you leave a mess in the Bathroom. Pt. 1 ‘Towels” might feel so familiar to you that it seems as if it were recorded from your childhood memories and restaged. When I watched this video, I felt this way — like it was the funnest, most familiar Instagram video I had ever seen.
I grew up in a multicultural household. My mom comes from a big Cuban family who immigrated to Panama in the 1940s for my abuelo’s job — he was a mechanic who could fix a particular model of bus that had just been shipped to Panama. Like most of the Spanish-speaking world, my mother was raised fervently Catholic. My father was raised in Edison, New Jersey, by reform Jewish parents, and lived as a secular hippie for the majority of his formative years. My mom moved to New Jersey in the 1970s. They met at work, and were married in the mid-’80s in a Unity church in North Jersey, the same church my sister and I were “baptized” in. (This church used rose petals instead of holy water, so actually I might be damned.) They bought a house in northern New Jersey, gave birth to my sister and me, and hustled to give us a life.
My dad worked in the city and traveled for work often, and Mama was a stay-at-home mom until my sister and I were in middle school. She was the one who ran the house. I learned English and Spanish at the same time, my mother always making a point to speak Spanish to us at home. Comfort food to me is food my mother cooked: picadillo, ropa vieja, yuca con mojo, platanos verdes. I don’t get into a car or on a plane without whispering to myself, “En el nombre de dios.” I question every single person’s intentions because my mother’s No. 1 consejo to me growing up was never to trust anyone on sight, even if they are dressed up as a nun.
Physically, my sister and I look way more like my dad, which is another way of saying we look white, and throughout my life I have most often been perceived as white by other people. As anyone who grew up with a multicultural background understands, there is always pressure from the outside to identify with one culture over another, even if no one is demanding that you choose. In the vacuum of my interior self, I identify as both white and Latina. But identity isn’t determined in that vacuum, and as a part of society, in the typical multicultural-kid way, I have spent a majority of my life feeling, variously, just white enough, not white enough, just Hispanic enough, or not Hispanic enough, depending on whom I was surrounded by and what kind of situation I was in. But never one or the other.
Which leads me, finally, to the other quality of a good Facebook Live video: Slow is good. The first webcam in history was invented so that scientists could see whether or not there was still coffee in the kitchen. In Australia, a live feed of a pitch drop experiment (pitch is a type of tar 230 billion times thicker than water) carries on. The drop has at least another decade before it falls, but you can bet more people will tune in as the moment nears. And that’s the important thing about the tar drop: Just like the watermelon, it’s building toward a release.
But it’s also over. And here’s the real problem: I don’t want to see another watermelon livestream ever again. It happened once; it was good; and it should never happen again. The downside of long, boring livestreams is that people will sit through them once and then never again. Facebook Live, spontaneous and intimate in its affect, isn’t a format that lends itself to regular, consistent broadcasts, like television. It’s for one-off stunts and pranks. And like most formats made for goofs, it won’t have a long shelf life. You can get nearly a million people to watch you blow up a watermelon once, but you won’t get that many again. If media companies are going to invest more resources in Facebook Live, they’re going to need to find something new to blow up.
Earlier today, BuzzFeed produced a video through Facebook’s new livestream product that was — if I’m being entirely honest — very good. At its peak, more than 800,000 people were simultaneously watching two BuzzFeed employees stretch rubber bands around a watermelon until the aggregate stress caused the melon to burst like that guy’s head in Scanners.
Right now, smart — or, at least, well-capitalized — media companies are trying to be “agile,” which mostly means changing their strategies frequently in order to focus on whatever kind of content has the best chance of appearing atop Facebook’s News Feed. “What appears atop Facebook’s News Feed,” however, is based on an ever-changing formula that only engineers at Facebook understand. Right now, Facebook is pushing live video hard — Facebook is subject to the whims of its users, who are sharing less original content; “Live” is an effort to encourage more original sharing — and so live video has a better chance of appearing in users’ feeds. Therefore: BuzzFeed is focusing heavily on live video.
We are still in the nascent days of frictionless live webcasts of this kind, and so media organizations, thirsty for the attention fire hose that Facebook can point in their direction, are experimenting (or talking about experimenting) with Facebook Live content. Oddly enough, vivid examples of extremely uncompelling livestreams can be found … over at BuzzFeed. On the BuzzFeed Now Page, attempts to recreate game shows and four-square competitions in 20-minute snippets fall flat, mainly because they are so aggressive in their attempts to replicate traditional media formats and personality-based entertainment. For other organizations, Live video experimentation more closely resembles traditional journalistic forms: interviews, explanations, documentation of newsworthy events occurring.
This content is valuable and edifying, but it is not what Facebook Live is for, and it is not what will work for live web video.
The exploding watermelon is the best illustration of what works for live web video.
Livestreams work best when they’re immediately arresting, visually and narratively, so that people can enter at any moment, from the very beginning to the very end, and understand immediately what’s happening. It’s hard to do that with interviews, or game shows, or news reports. That’s why streams on Twitch, the Amazon-owned video-game livestreaming site, are so compelling — they feature someone doing a repetitive act for a long time, just like watching someone stretch 763 rubber bands around a fruit for a long time.
And it was long: By the standards of web video, 45 minutes is an eternity. This, too, is right: No one is going to make the effort in exchange for five minutes of low-res video of someone’s face. You want the sort of thing you can keep in the corner of the screen and check in on every so often. Three-quarters of an hour of slowly building tension gives a video plenty of time to disseminate across Facebook and other platforms.
The disastrous Sony hack that occurred in late 2014 was just one of many attacks that were and continue to be carried out by the same group of hackers. According to new data from malware researchers Juan Andrés Guerrero-Saade and Jaime Blasco, as summarized in Wired, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that the hackers are using the same techniques and code bases across a range of targets.
Using a tool called YARA, which identifies suspicious activity and malware, researchers compiled a “taxonomy” of various types of malware and techniques. “Over the course of more than a year, they collected 400 to 500 malware samples used in attacks now believed to be related,” Wired says, “as well as other digital footprints left behind by the group or groups of hackers behind the attacks.” The hackers also used the same dropper (the code that inserts malware into a computer) in several of their intrusions.
While some similarities noted were simple — a repeated misspelling of “Mozilla” as “Mozillar,” for instance — most of the telltale signs are more technical in nature. Experts identified that hackers were compiling an ever-changing list of sandbox names to watch out for. Sandboxes are computer environments virtually separated from other parts of the machine, and antivirus programs use them to execute and analyze potentially malicious code.
The exact identity of whoever is orchestrating the attacks (or how many people or how many groups are involved) is still very unclear, but by connecting the dots between tools they use, the picture gets slightly clearer. While many believe that the Sony hack was executed by or on behalf of North Korea, that has not been definitively proven. There is evidence to suggest that this belief is true, though: An analysis of dozens of intrusions shows that “the adversaries appear to have focused exclusively on targets in South Korea, and they’ve made the mistake several times of leaving Korean language in their files when they compiled their code.”
Still, Guerrero-Saade and Blasco are not in the business of identifying hackers, only studying them. There are a lot of blank spaces left to fill.
At the end of every year, the paint company Pantone picks a color that will symbolize the ~cultural zeitgeist~ of the coming year, spawning a hundred short trend-piece write-ups like the one you are reading right now. For 2016, those colors are straight from the vintage internet. “Rose quartz and serenity,” an airy pink set against a kind of saturated pale-blue, are floaty, inorganic, and look perfectly at home on a Tumblr page. It’s the same color combination found in this Prodigy guidebook and the America Online welcome page.
The pairing is a rarity, since the company usually only picks a single color. The choice isn’t just made-up — Pantone makes a careful study of new fashion lines and decorating trends, even polling designers as to what they think is cool. (Okay, fine, it’s still made-up, just much more elaborately than you think.) But there must be something in the air that points to these transcendent colors. Drake’s “Hotline Bling” video, with its nigh-virtual abstract spaces, uses almost exactly the same hues.
The Pantone colors have a long run of being relatively dull and organic. The most recent choice that has the same digital sheen as rose quartz and serenity is probably 2011’s honeysuckle, and that’s named after a plant rather than a metaphysical crystal or an abstract feeling. 2015’s color was marsala. The 2016 selection is a gesture at something different, a revisionary vibe. It’s no coincidence that the colors are also found on transgender-pride-flag designs, as Quartz points out.
The Pantone color video is a kind of faux-CGI rove through a woman’s billowing scarf, in a perfect Photoshop gradient of rose quartz and serenity, that seems like it could be pulled directly from an early-’90s screensaver. The tweet that it used as an announcement even turns the two colors into hashtags, a gesture that seems well-suited to a choice less of colors than of digital concepts.
Popular singer Ed Sheeran — best known for waiting for Taylor Swift to see the nice guy standing right in front of her — announced yesterday that he was quitting his “phone, emails and all social media for a while.”
Best of luck, Ed. You’re finally free. I know you said you’ll be back in the fall, but I urge you to reconsider: Run. Run, and don’t ever look back.
One perk of our modern society’s rapidly increasing propensity for mass surveillance is that we see some nice animals. In this case, it’s a snowy owl from Canada. Quebec transport minister Robert Poëti shared these images of an owl that were captured by a highway surveillance camera last Sunday.
Great job, Canada. Meanwhile, in America, we’re still losing our minds over the rat that dragged a slice of pizza two feet.
If you’re like most of America and require a constant stream of piping-hot Kim Kardashian content, great news: She got a Snapchat today. Considering a nude selfie landed her in the middle of a media shitstorm with people like Bette Midler and Piers Morgan already this week, doubling down and joining the app most famous for how it revolutionized sexting is a pretty elegant “fuck you.”
The tweet announcing her Snapchat handle came after Kim dropped a blog post for International Women’s Day, addressing Twitter’s problem with her naked body head-on: “I will not live my life dictated by the issues you have with my sexuality.”
Like most of her accounts, it’s safe to say the new Snapchat will live by a 10 percent hard-in-the-paint sexuality, 90 percent family-friendly fun and makeup tips breakdown, and it probably goes without saying that a great deal of those will be selfies.
But considering what she has at her disposal props-wise, and how much more casual Kylie’s Snapchat is than her Instagram, I think there’s reason to hope for some fun extras. Here’s my wish list:
• Nori and P playing with the face filters• Someone putting food in Kris’s hair• Kanye scuttling out of frame• Evidence of Blac Chyna feeling welcome in any of their homes• Someone putting food on Kris’s furniture• Joyce Bonelli’s cackle• Slender Rob• A new ep of Kylie’s soap opera• Gunnar Peterson• Lala Anthony, Larsa Pippen• Mason’s thoughts on literally anything• The big salads• Any sign of Kourtney’s definitely-dead-by-now cat• And the family dogs, actually, while we’re at it
It’s kind of like Glee got even nerdier. For a digital media class at Utah Valley University, Austin Hale redubbed a Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer a cappella, with only his own voice to mimic the spaceship flybys, lightsaber swipes, and dramatic orchestral soundtrack. The result is a hilarious twee-epic, dedicated to Daniel Fleetwood, the Star Wars fan who died shortly after he previewed the new movie.
But in recent years, apps have increasingly found ways to combine the command line interface with the GUI text box, creating a hybrid that merges the GUI’s approachability with the CLI’s power. Peach’s magic words are a good, simple example: A few years ago, you might have seen every action tied to a magic word included in a menu interface, letting you scroll through and peruse all of your options. Peach does away with this, though — just start typing, and if the text matches up with a command, the app will let you perform it.
Peach is far from the only app to move toward a more free-form approach to human-computer interaction. In Mac OS X, hitting ⌘-space brings up Spotlight Search, which has broadened its scope in each iteration. Originally meant to search local files on your hard drive, Spotlight can now parse text inputs to launch apps quickly, search for movie showtimes, look up information on Wikipedia, run mathematical calculations and conversions, etc.
The popular chatroom/collaboration software Slack uses slash commands similar to what its spiritual predecessor IRC used. Typing “/away” into the text field doesn’t send that message to your co-workers, it just toggles your status. These commands are extendable, and people have made all kinds of custom slash commands and slackbots, the idea being that it keeps user interaction focused around the text field.
The text field is key. It’s partly the solution to a problem that has long plagued mobile developers: Less screen real estate means less space to present interaction options to the users. But it’s also that, for the first time, engineers and and developers are creating products for a population that’s truly digital native — for whom typing comes naturally and for whom digital actions don’t need to be metaphorized.
Now that the computer most people use most often is carried in their pockets and doesn’t have a “desktop,” WIMP’s strengths are less important. And made a little more friendly looking and stripped of its connotations as a nerd’s power tool, text input is an even lower barrier to entry than any GUI: The only limit is your vocabulary. Now that computational power is available at a lower price than ever before, it’s possible to create pseudo-command-line systems with greater leeway for mistakes, and even the limited ability to “learn.” (In other words, you don’t need to learn a whole manual’s worth of commands to use it effectively.)
In the command line, you had to have your options memorized; in the GUI, you could browse the options. But in a new space of user experience, there is no clear set of options for interacting with software. There is, if software continues to track in this direction, no command that a computer won’t be able to process, and that will make them subsequently easier to use, and more vital than ever.
The experience is so important to some that for initiatives like Facebook’s M service, artificial intelligence is supplemented by the work of actual human beings on the other end. And this is the place where Facebook might feel a little threatened by Peach. While we tend to think of Facebook as a social network defined by its News Feed, the company is pouring more and more resources into its stand-alone messaging app, turning it and “M” into a way to accomplish tasks like ordering an Uber. A social network is worth a lot of money. But a service that can insert itself into a middleman in nearly any transaction is potentially worth even more.
And this, ultimately, is the future of user interface. We’re coming out of a 30-year period in which personal computers obeyed the rules of a particular metaphor, the office desk, and into one in which they’re going to obey another, the personal assistant. That includes “digital” assistants like M, Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Google. Advanced voice recognition and intelligent text parsing don’t just get a user relevant information or perform an action faster than using a GUI might — they can also become a new layer of services from which money can be extracted. Peach isn’t there yet, and probably never will be. But if I were a venture capitalist I wouldn’t be asking them about how they plan to compete with News Feed — I’d be asking them how they plan to compete with M.
Shortly before the end of the workday last Friday, an app called Peach suddenly became the hottest social network among a small but influential coterie of digital media industry watchers. It’s tough to say precisely what Peach is. It’s a social network that lets users post all types of media, but feeds aren’t public, nor does it have an aggregate feed similar to a Facebook News Feed — every user is siloed.
Peach is fun to play around with, but mostly what it has going for it as a social network is that it’s not Twitter or Facebook. The one interesting thing about Peach is a feature that its makers — which include a co-founder of Vine — call “magic words.” Magic words are shortcuts that allow users to access new types of posting features. Typing “GIF,” for instance, lets users search for the appropriate media to post; “battery” offers a way for users to post their current charge percentage; “move” lets users access their phone’s motion tracking to post the number of steps or distance traveled.
“Magic words” are easy, and they feel fresh and new compared to the button- and menu-heavy interface for posting status updates to Facebook. But they’re about as old a user interface as you can imagine. Peach is the latest app to turn away from a pure GUI, a “graphical user interface” that relies on buttons and icons, and back toward a watered-down version of a CLI, the text-based “command line interface” that was the defining method of using personal computers until the 1980s, joining much bigger peers like Apple, Microsoft, Slack, and, yes, Facebook in an attempt to rethink how we interact with our various devices by looking at computing’s past.
The early days of computing (at least, computing that required a screen) used the command line as the singular method of user input. Users typed their commands as text. It wasn’t until Apple began manufacturing computers — with a clickable, menu-based interface famously stolen from Xerox — that alternative, graphical systems came to prominence. The command line argument is still used today by programmers, but since the mid-1980s, the GUI has been the dominant mode of consumer-facing personal computing — in particular, a subset of GUI known as WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointer).
There are obvious advantages to the WIMP system. It makes understanding how a computer works simpler by attaching physical-world metaphors to all actions. We’ve gotten so used to WIMP systems that it can take a minute to remember the extent to which its basic building blocks are formed of analog analogues: “Files” are placed in “folders,” “deleted” items go in the “trash,” actions are compartmentalized into taskbar “menus” at the top of the window, and icons like the floppy disk reflect actions such as saving a file (maybe it’s time to update that one).
Using a computer with a GUI, which requires lots of moving and clicking, tends to be somewhat slower than using one with a command line, but the learning curve is far steeper on a command line interface, where visual metaphor doesn’t exist and every action requires knowing the specific command. Clicking through, copying, and creating folders on your PC requires a handful of clicks or keyboard shortcuts. In the command line, it requires knowing commands like “cd,” “cp,” and “mkdir.” On a WIMP operating system, the help menu is ever-present at the top of the screen. In a Unix shell, typing the “help” argument pulls up this:
Mastering the command line has clear benefits. Many coders still swear by it, claiming that the WIMP system only slows them down. Working within a GUI, for instance, uses up more of a computer’s hardware than a text-based interface. As Wired wrote in 2012, “geeks like command lines just because you have to know what you’re doing to use it. You have to know the commands. You can’t hunt and peck like you do with a GUI.” This idea of mastering the command line can be seen in other industries besides software and hardware development. The Bloomberg Terminal, widely used within the finance industry, has an atrocious appearance, and some power users — prideful of having mastered the inelegant system — navigate solely via keystroke.
High school is difficult enough without also having to run into this red-onion catastrophe in the bathroom.
Who did this? Who would bring these onions to school just to ruin a toilet? The truth is out there.
Let’s not beat around the bush: This video of a bird yelling into a cup is eight months old. It has more than 2.4 million views already. It has been viral for months.
We missed the boat on this bird, and its cup, which it yells into. Part of that has to do with the fact that this blog did not exist in May of 2015, but that doesn’t really matter, because I was only made aware of the yelling bird today. It’s a great video and, even though this bird has already taken wing on a viral gust of shares, it seems worth posting anyway.
In the words of this bird, “AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH.”
Are you an Instagram Husband? A hapless man, forced by your romantic companion into a life of snapping smartphone pictures, trying out filters, and scouting the perfect brick wall to pose against? You’re not alone, and you don’t have to keep suffering. There’s help.
So runs this satirical PSA from instagramhusbands.com, a new support group for men oppressed by Instagram (created by the cast of The Mystery Hour TV show). The social network has bred a kind of lifestyle competition. It’s easy to feel like you have to one-up your friends and followers by snapping a photo of your shoes on every nicely tiled floor you walk across. And once Instagramming escalates, the rest of the world has to freeze around you as you take the perfect selfie or soft-focus photo of your cappuccino. Documenting becomes more important than living.
Send it to every victim of excessive Instagramming you know, just in case they need to reach out. They’re not the only one. As one Instagram husband, P. Hedlund, says, “They say the hope I need is right around the corner, I just hope there isn’t an old door before we get there.”
Straight-up: No.
If you watch the tape, it’s very clear that Daulerio is giving a petulant response to a silly question. But, of course, petulance, sarcasm, irony, and flippancy, as charming as those moods might be when adopted by bloggers, definitively do not translate in sworn depositions. That final answer, “Four,” was interpreted oddly seriously by some — including the New York Times, which implied that Daulerio was assenting to the hypothetical publication of sex tapes featuring children ages 5 and up.
Gawker’s spokesperson clarified in a statement that the second part of the exchange was sarcastic: “He’d just said in the prior answer that he wouldn’t post a tape of a child and when the question was repeated he obviously made the point in a flip way because his answer was already clear.” But, of course, none of this matters: Daulerio’s response may not have been evil, strictly speaking, but it was very, very stupid.
Okay, that’s cleared up. But did any other Gawker witnesses say stupid and incorrect things?
Oh, for sure. Here’s Gawker head honcho Nick Denton in another taped deposition:
Denton — more practiced in his defense of tabloid journalism and gossip as noble pursuits — also gave a crash course in digital media, explaining phrases like “page view metrics” and “traffic whoring,” the latter of which he described as “gratuitous” and likened to “empty calories.”
Surely there was some expert on hand to rebut Denton’s testimony.
I mean, define expert. Hogan’s team is employing a University of Florida journalism professor named Mike Foley to testify on their behalf (and compensating him handsomely to do so).
Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker Media — currently captivating an audience of thousands of bloggers and wrestling fans — is body-slamming its way through a Florida courtroom. On Wednesday, Hogan’s lawyers played video of former Gawker editor A.J. Daulerio’s 2013 deposition, which, among other things, taught a valuable lesson in the correct venues for sarcasm. Today, Gawker’s lawyer is cross-examining one of Hogan’s expert witnesses, University of Florida journalism professor Mike Foley, in the process teaching his own lesson on the value of a University of Florida journalism degree.
The thrust of Foley’s testimony on Wednesday was that Gawker had behaved unethically, published non-newsworthy material, and failed to pass the “Cheerios test.” In particular, Foley and Hogan’s lawyers harped on Gawker’s apparent violations of the Society of Professional Journalists’ Code of Ethics. The problem with this line of argument is that it conflates those ethical guidelines with legal guidelines, which they are decidedly not.
Nevertheless, Foley marched on: “You don’t want to invade someone’s privacy for example, without a good reason,” Foley told the court. Clearly, his definition of “good reason” differs from Gawker’s, and that’s what the trial comes down to. Was Gawker’s post newsworthy and, therefore, justifiable to publish?
Today, by most accounts, Foley is getting torched in cross-examination. He confirmed that he has not worked as a reporter in more than four decades and left the Tampa Bay Times before they had even begun to establish a web presence.
What is the, uh, “Cheerios test”?
Foley’s whole testimony centers on something referred to as “the Cheerios test,” which asks, “Would you want your readers to see this at breakfast, first thing in the morning?”
Gawker’s cross-examination today aims to dismiss the assertion that there is a single smell or, I guess, breakfast test that can be applied to every news story, and that different publications have different readerships.
The other argument Gawker is rolling out is that Foley doesn’t understand the difference between straight news and commentary, arguing that the Hogan post was in the latter. In that sense, the post had news value but was not presented as simple reporting.
Who’s going to win?
The background, in case your “Hulk Hogan” Google alerts have not been delivering, is this: In 2012, Gawker, a news and gossip blog, published a video featuring excerpts from a sex tape featuring Hogan (real name Terry Bollea) and the wife of a friend. Hogan sued the company (and Daulerio), and the lawsuit is now playing out in front of a Florida jury. Earlier this week, Hogan himself testified in a bold attempt to limn the distinction between Terry Bollea and Hulk Hogan. Yesterday and today have mostly been about Daulerio and Denton’s pretaped depositions and the testimony of expert Foley. Read on to have all of your questions answered.
For months now, legal experts have been predicting a victory for Hogan. Even Gawker’s president (a lawyer herself), Heather Deitrick, has admitted that putting New York gossipmongers on the stand in front of a St. Petersburg jury to defend the publication of a sex tape featuring a local hero means that it’s “more than likely” Gawker will lose.
On the other hand, Gawker will almost certainly win on appeal — federal judges generally give publishers a wide berth, and the company has won several appeals it’s already filed over the last three years. So the question for Gawker’s future is: How big a judgment will the jury award? The lawsuit is requesting $100 million, a figure that — were Gawker forced to post bond, which Florida law would require — could wipe the company out. But there’s a good chance the suit could end in a small award for Hogan, which the company might not even bother to appeal.
Did a Gawker editor say something very stupid?
Yes. In a deposition taped in 2013, Daulerio, who wrote the post in question, was asked about hypothetical limits to Gawker’s sex-tape coverage.
Did a Gawker editor say he’d publish sex tapes featuring children?
What makes a good Twitter profile? At Columbia Journalism Review, two internet marketers have some suggestions, analyzing four journalists’ Twitter profiles and providing tips. Much of the advice reads like a tutorial on grooming your LinkedIn profile — give out your real location; list your past jobs, or the elite institutions you attended; include a real photograph, etc. I would suggest: Don’t.
I mean, sure, do! Whatever floats your boat. But this advice (given, I’ll admit, with tongue somewhat in cheek), like most advice from social-media marketing professional-types, encourages the troubling line of thinking that Twitter is a business tool — a way to interact and “engage” with customers (in the case of journalists, readers) and potential employers.
The thing is, this is not really how most people, journalists especially, use Twitter. The reason, for example, that Shane Smith doesn’t mention that he runs Vice in his bio, is because Shane Smith assumes that the followers he actually cares about — people who keep a close eye on the media industry — already know who Shane Smith is. Shane Smith isn’t tweeting for anyone but the people who already know who he is.
This tends to be true of anyone who’s “good” at Twitter. The best people I follow are people who have dropped the idea of using their account as a purely professional resource. They post embarrassing anecdotes and goofy, stupid jokes and that makes them far more interesting than anyone who’s just online to say, “Please read my articles!” Post some great links, but don’t only post great links. Throw in a few shitty links and memes to spice it up.
Taking the advice of CJR’s experts and treating your Twitter bio like yet another iteration of your professional résumé would be to partake in the worst trend social media has to offer us: The increasing inseparability of our “professional” identities and our “personal” identities. Twitter is goofy, ephemeral nonsense, and should be treated as such — not as another extension of our Personal Brand, to be massaged and obsessed over.
It should be obvious that all of the advice I’ve given out is colored by my identity as a straight, white man. I can be freewheeling on Twitter because my bio and my profile pic and the tweets I compose are not taken to be representative of my race or gender as a whole. This is decidedly not the case for women and minorities online, who frequently face the unnecessary burden of the assumption that they are speaking on behalf of large swaths of people. It helps me to remember this: Almost everyone on Twitter represents only themselves, and in rare cases, the organizations that employ them. It would be nice if everyone was able to police themselves as lazily as I police myself, but that’s not the case right now.
The main thing I’m trying to say about how you appear on Twitter is: Do what makes you happy. Don’t worry if you’ve maximized your Twitter bio to increase engagement. Twitter is not a good place to find a job, or, really, to find customers. It’s a good place to mess around and argue and, most important, make jokes. Any attention you gain from that comes from an honest place, not grandstanding, and that’s a nice feeling. Including your résumé in your profile because you’re worried about how you might appear is just one more way to make the internet a little less fun and a little more anxiety-inducing.
A 2013 experiment found that participants could remember Facebook posts from friends faster and longer than sentences from books, even without the quirks of internet language: “The difference was not due to posts containing emoticons, unique characters, or many or few words; the advantage persisted when all such posts were removed,” the report stated. What’s more, Facebook posts performed even better against the memorability of human faces. “The posts may naturally elicit social thinking and lead to stronger encoding of the posts … The relatively unfiltered and spontaneous production of one person’s mind is just the sort of thing that is readily stored in another’s mind.”
The stickiness of social-media memories can actually distort the truth, however. Social media has the power to “undermine the coherence between our real, lived lives and memories,” Dr. Richard Sherry, a founding member of the Society for Neuropsychoanalysis, told the Telegraph. Precisely because it’s easier to recall, the information we choose to store on the internet and social media has a tendency to warp our memories rather than clarify them. Even after just a few repetitions, memories can become massively distorted, another study found.
This means that all the stuff that Google or Facebook constantly reminds you of is what you’re going to actually remember, which might be the scariest part of all. Keep selectively editing those social media profiles! It’ll make you a lot happier in the future.
When I wake up and check my phone in the morning, it often has a few reminders for me. Facebook tells me that I have new “memories” with friends through its “On This Day” feature — an anniversary of when I first met some rando, or an update from a long-past party. A few hours later, Google notes that it’s my mom’s birthday and it auto-tagged some photos I’m in with friends from last night. Then I get another pop-up Facebook alert for an event I’m going to that night. I can’t tell if technology is making me lose my memory, or if I now have too much of it.
Prosthetic knowledge, as the title of a popular tech Tumblr has it, means “information that a person does not know, but can access as needed using technology.” The internet, particularly social media, has given us a place to store our memories in a way that was previously unimaginable — not only can we Google the population of a country or the location of a restaurant rather than recall it ourselves, we can also use Facebook and Twitter to chart out our social circles, not to mention our entire adult lives.
This prosthetic knowledge can be kind of scary, since we don’t actually control it. Sometimes it feels like social media has taken over our brains, orchestrating our social calendars with reminders and prodding us to recall events we might sometimes rather forget — bad breakups, or even deaths in the family. So our memories are in the clutches of a bunch of uncaring algorithms, secretly shaping our lives. Thankfully, the internet’s impact on our brains isn’t quite that terrifying.
It’s true that we have to remember less random information than generations past, but we’re more focused on remembering something else — how to retrieve the information. “When faced with difficult questions, people are primed to think about computers … when people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information itself and enhanced recall instead for where to access it,” a Columbia-led study found in 2011.
In other words, while it’s not important that you memorize the population of the U.S., it is important that you know how to find it (same with your significant other’s birthday). In one study with information stored in folder systems on a computer, participants “who were told they could look back on the information didn’t remember facts, but remembered the color of the folder,” says Tracy Packiam Alloway, an independent psychologist and former director of the U.K. Center for Memory and Learning in the Lifespan.
There’s a criticism that relying on social media means “losing our ability to keep everything in mind,” Alloway says. But it’s actually the opposite — the internet “frees up brain resources” so that rather than trying to memorize information, we’re actively engaging with it. Social media strengthens our ability to filter for data that’s relevant to us, the way we’re all used to picking out the one funny or important tweet out of an endless feed.
In another study, Alloway gave a standardized test to high-school students, some whom had used Facebook for less than six months and others who had used it for years. “Teens who had been on for longer had higher working memory, better verbal skills, better vocabulary, and language as well,” she says. Rather than destroying their minds, Facebook helped them practice deciding what to pay attention to and what to forget, as we have to do even with Facebook’s curated feed. Using YouTube, however, doesn’t help kids, according to tests, because it’s too passive. “It’s not the same kind of incoming information,” Alloway says.
It’s also easy to feel like social media is just an ephemeral avalanche of information. We can’t engage with it in the same way we can, say, a printed book, or a conversation with other living humans at a café. “You no longer have those vivid memories of interaction, your memories are located within the internet,” says NYU developmental psychologist Niobe Way. “It’s a much more passive experience. What we know about memory is, the more passive it is the less likely it’s going to stick.” Yet it turns out that social media is actually strikingly easy to remember.
Laughs got the best of Hilary Barry, a New Zealand journalist and television personality, this week after she lost her composure while describing a story that involved an “emergency defecation situation.”
The story following the one about the poop fiasco was slightly more serious, involving the Somali plane explosion that is believed to have killed at least one man. Barry managed to get a second wave of laughter just as she got to the detail of the victim who was sucked out of the hole in the plane’s fuselage. She clarified that the plane incident was not the reason that she was laughing.
“Today could be the day I lose my job,” she quipped.
This afternoon, someone posted this photo to Kim Kardashian’s Instagram account.
Please stop giving North your phones.
It was captioned:
Which, I mean, ha-ha, sure, Kim. Nobody’s buying it. For one thing, the picture is not square. Instagram allows for this now, but not by default; it’s highly unlikely that North West (a small child) knew how to change the aspect ratio and then post a well-cropped photo.
Many social media users are now blaming North West for accidentally posting embarrassing (or not-so-embarrassing) photos to their feeds.
Who is this? Rooster Teeth, a production company best known for making movies out of the multiplayer mode in video games, a genre known as machinima to the cognoscenti. Why is this? Rooster Teeth’s series Red vs. Blue, a narrative made by adding voice-overs to clips from Halo, is among YouTube’s oldest and best-known. What is this? Four guys each get trapped in a different piece of an alien suit of armor and have to fight off an invader. But get this: The guys aren’t fighters, they’re schlubs! Will they succeed? Almost certainly, yes. How is this? “There’s not a big demand for laugh-free comedies,” observes the Times’ Neil Genzlinger.
Dance Camp
Okay, this is just Step Up but it’s at camp. That’s it, I think. That’s fine though because the last Step Up movie came out two years ago, which might as well be 14 bazillion years ago in YouTube Time.
YouTube’s attempt at a subscription model, YouTube Red, takes its tentative first steps today with the launch of three new feature-length films, as well as a reality series starring the most popular YouTuber of all-time, PewDiePie. Unlike the prestige projects of Netflix and Amazon, these are all designed to feed off of the popularity of current YouTubers — which means while most teenagers have heard of at least one of the four stars or production companies involved, most people over the age of 25 haven’t. Here’s our guide.
Scare PewDiePie
Who is this? PewDiePie, a manic, 26-year-old Swedish gamer who’s made a fortune broadcasting himself getting very scared while playing horror video games. What is this? The premise of the show, which is called Scare PewDiePie, is to force PewDiePie to live out horror video games, in the hopes of scaring him. Why is this? Kids love PewDiePie: His fan base, which he calls “the Bro Army,” sends millions of views to his videos; among teenagers he is, one survey claims, more popular than “mainstream celebrities” like Jennifer Lawrence. How is this? The first episode is all right. He has a very conspicuous camera rig harnessed to his chest the entire time that breaks some of the immersion but I am 1,000 years old and probably the only one who cares.
A Trip to Unicorn Island
Who is this? Lilly Singh, a 27-year-old Indian-Canadian comedian, rapper, and motivational speaker known for videos like “Girls On Their Periods” and “How Girls Get Ready.” What is this? A documentary follows Singh around the world on her 27-city world tour, where she dances and raps and inspires teens to believe. Why is this? Singh’s YouTube channel, home of her trademark astute cultural commentary, has millions of subscribers; she’s been on The Daily Show and The Tonight Show. How is this? “Unicorn Island is that state I reach when I decide everything’s going to be okay,” she tells us. Sorry to spoil the movie for you but that’s the movie. Also, Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson appears in it for a few minutes, so that’s worth something.

Wikipedia, the crowdsourced knowledge base that has become the go-to info source for eighth-graders and professionals alike, turns 15 today. Fifteen years! Can you even remember a time before Wikipedia? What did people even do? Pay for and then read books? Like a caveman? Yeesh.

“I just want everyone to know that I am here to inspire people. I’m not here to cause any problems. I’m just a normal girl from Idaho, just another cowgirl, and just happened to go viral,” she said. “Did I plan on it? Absolutely not. Did I want that? Probably not.”
She also claimed she visited “every Walmart in Pueblo” on Sunday in search of the cashier, but couldn’t find him.
An inspirational story, sure, but an unlikely one.
Over the past few days, nearly 900,000 people have shared a Colorado woman’s heartbreaking Facebook video about how she comforted a young Walmart employee whose mother had committed suicide. People have now watched her nearly break down in tears 25 million times. But according to Walmart, the touching episode didn’t happen — at least not the way she claimed.
Paige Yore said she was waiting in a long line at Walmart, which was getting longer because of a teenage cashier who was obviously upset and was having trouble ringing up customers. According to Yore, a woman in front of her in line threw a fit at the clerk after her card was declined. Yore says she stood up to the woman on the young man’s behalf, and he came around the counter to give her a hug. At that point, he started crying and revealed that his mom had committed suicide that morning, and he was desperately worried about paying his rent.
Yore said she gave the boy all the money in her wallet, and she ended the video with the moral that “you don’t just lay into somebody like that, because you never know what’s going on in their life.”
It was a perfect story from a humble hero, and commenters called Yore “an angel from above” and wrote, “We need more people like you in this world.”
An incident like this would look great for the Walmart #brand, but a spokesman for the company told Buzzfeed they’d reviewed the footage of Yore checking out that day, and it doesn’t look like the incident actually took place.
“We see her come up and she’s checking out and there doesn’t seem to be a lot of conversation,” the spokesperson said.
And as for the young cashier, Walmart told Buzzfeed, “We found that the associate’s mother is actually alive and in good health.” The cashier told the company he’d just been doing his job normally that day.
Speaking to Pueblo news station KRDO, Yore maintained her story was true, in spite of Walmart’s video evidence.
The locked iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters, may finally have been accessed by the FBI, prematurely ending the agency’s court battle with Apple, but who knows if it was even worth it in the first place: Though the FBI has confirmed it gained access to the phone via a mysterious method provided by a third party, it won’t comment on whether or not anything on the phone was pertinent.
According to the New York Times, the FBI’s top lawyer, James Baker, briefed privacy professionals on the situation this week. Though he said that the bureau had extracted data from the phone (duh doy, of course the phone had data), he would not comment on whether the data was useful. “We’re still working on that, I guess is the answer,” he reportedly said.
This was to be expected. The FBI had launched their legal fight against Apple without even knowing whether Farook’s device had anything of interest, invoking themes like “justice for the victims and their families” to make their case to the public. Even if there was nothing on the phone, they supposedly had to access it.
Also to be expected: the hundreds of local law-enforcement agencies that have contacted the FBI with requests for assistance. Even before the shooting, according to USA Today, more than 500 cases involving locked devices were pending before the bureau; the FBI said in a statement that it would evaluate each request “on a case by case basis, using known forensic tools to assist when appropriate, consistent with our legal and privacy constraints.” Which is a nice thought, but doesn’t actually mean anything.
In the meantime, the FBI is also reportedly briefing senators on the investigation. According to the National Journal, California senator Dianne Feinstein was briefed on specifically how the FBI was able to access Farook’s phone, and North Carolina senator Richard Burr is set to also receive that info. (So, you know, if you need to get into a locked phone, try calling their offices.) The pair has been working on new legislation to limit encryption in consumer technology.
Privacy and technology advocates have called for the method to be made public, or at least disclosed to Apple, so that the company can close the breach, but law enforcement obviously has significant incentive to keep quiet on the matter. Given that the method was brought to the FBI by a third party though, rather than developed internally, it’s already floating around outside the government’s purview. In a talk last night, however, FBI director James Comey said that the technique did not work on newer iPhone 6 models or the iPhone 5s. “We have a tool that works on a narrow slice of phones,” he said.
All of this is … pretty much what was expected to happen. The FBI was never going to say one way or another whether the data it accessed on the phone was useful, and the methods it used were always going to trickle down to local law enforcement — but not to Apple itself.
Now, when you end a relationship, you don’t even need to unfriend your former partner, because Facebook will take care of the awkwardness for you. When relationships end, the social network will ask you how you want to handle it — seeing less of the ex online, only allowing them to view a limited profile, and systematically editing every post they were ever involved in on your account.
It’s sort of like a computer wizard for breaking up. Do you want to erase your ex from your social media life forever? Facebook makes it easy. But it’s probably hoping that rather than jumping straight to blocking them, you go through the steps it provides and keep the social ties that the network thrives on unbroken.
Instead of that black-or-white choice, Facebook is offering gradations that are closer to what we actually experience. Maybe you ignore your ex for a while but want to be friends again eventually. You don’t see them for a while but you keep their phone number just in case. Now, those dynamics can be reflected on social media as well. And even if you say you don’t want to see as many of your ex’s posts, if you start liking them all, odds are Facebook’s going to show you more of them, you backslider.
The launch shows a more human side of the social network. Break-up options represent “our ongoing effort to develop resources for people who may be going through difficult moments in their lives,” as the company describes it. Similar to its “memorialization” process for the accounts of deceased users, as it matures and expands, Facebook is having to find ways to make life online conform more closely to life offline, with more subtlety and tact than it’s ever had before.
The unintentional hoaxer, “Johnson Thompson,” later released a second video revealing how the whole thing was done: by layering day and night shots of Canberra, then adding sound and lighting effects. Tucker was right about the “aurora” — but it was added in digitally, not caused by energy from an unlikely lightning storm.
He said that he never meant to fool anyone and “didn’t think the video would gain as much attention as it did.”
“I didn’t intend for it to be taken seriously, but I made an error in judgement and titled the video as if it was real,” he added later on Reddit, in a post called “an apology from an idiot.”
He couldn’t have pulled a better hoax if he’d tried. Not bad for someone who claims he’d just bought After Effects two days before he made the fake video.
An Australian YouTuber playing around with video-editing software accidentally created a UFO hoax that was viewed hundreds of thousands of times and sucked in several news outlets. Journalists consulted astronomers and meteorologists, and reported that the unexplained light in the sky was probably ball lightning. Really, it was just a composite someone whipped up in Blender and After Effects.
Over the weekend, Australian National University astronomer Brad Tucker gave the ABC a very plausible and elaborate explanation for the video, trying to make sense of what he was seeing: It had to be a rare combination of an aurora and ball lightning.
“An aurora is when energy from the sun hits the Earth’s atmosphere, the energy rubs the Earth’s atmosphere with friction and charges the gas,” he said. “But the problem is there was no activity from the sun, it was cloudy, we can’t see the aurora, so it doesn’t really fit.”
“The same activity that causes an aurora can actually happen inside our atmosphere if you have a storm with a lot of electrical charge that is rubbing against the gases in our atmosphere, causing it to grow that green or red color,” he said.
“Sometimes, if you get a really interesting occurrence, you create something called ‘ball lightning.’ Normally lightning strikes up and down hitting the ground, but ball lightning is a weird thing where it appears as a ball explosion, sometimes it can even move around in the sky.”
It’s a good theory, if you assume the video is real. And Tucker had no reason not to.
“It’s probably not Photoshop either,” he said. “Everything kind of fits and it seems right.”
The ABC wasn’t the only news source to pick up the “UFO” video: The Canberra Times and others fell for it, too.
It looks like NPR figured out how to use the device to their advantage, however. Their story update ended with a new command. “Alexa, listen up,” host Rachel Martin said. “We want you to pledge to your local member station. You hear me? Lots and lots of money. Did you get that, Alexa?”
Voice-activated tools like the Amazon Echo seem great. You can ask them about the weather; you can order an Uber from them, or a pizza. But, on occasion, these systems can seem not quite ready for prime time.
Case in point: this weekend, when an NPR report on Amazon’s Echo device wreaked havoc on devices that were within earshot of the report.
In an update to the story, NPR said:
It’s kind of like that 30 Rock episode where Jack pitches a voice-activated TV.
A couple of years ago, a troll on Xbox Live took advantage of the console’s voice-controlled Kinect device by making his username “Xbox Sign Out.” This had the (obvious in retrospect) result of screwing with anyone trying to talk to him during a match.
The new LOL fits Houellebecq’s signature nihilism. In fact, his most recent book, Submission, written far before the attacks, imagines an unresistant France under a charismatic Muslim president. “For 10 (20? 30?) years, our successive governments have pathetically, systematically, deplorably failed in their essential mission: to protect the population under their responsibility,” he writes in the op-ed. LOL.
LOL just sneaked into an op-ed in America’s paper of record. The French novelist Michel Houellebecq, author of several society-satirizing books, wrote a piece for the New York Times on the failures of French leadership following the recent attacks in Paris. The French will survive, he argues, out of force of habit at least, but “it’s unlikely that the insignificant opportunist who passes for our head of state, or the congenital moron who plays the part of our prime minister, or even the ‘stars of the opposition’ (LOL) will emerge from the test looking any brighter.”
Houellebecq’s LOL — so blatant, so stone-cold sarcastic, highlighted by its parenthetical — is, as far as we can tell, the first time LOL has been used in a semantically meaningful way in a printed Times article. In the past, LOL has only been used in discussions of LOL as a word or phrase itself: In 2006, there’s a mention of a virus that replicates the phrase “lol that’s cool”; in 2011, there was an editorial mocking the OED’s adoption of the acronym. (A search of the archives reveals that LOL has made its way into a smattering of blog posts, where it’s deployed with meaning, if superficially.)
LOL was first codified in 1989 by Wayne Pearson on the Canadian message board Viewline as a way to communicate emotions otherwise invisible online. “A friend of mine who went by Sprout (and I believe he still does) had said something so funny in the teleconference room that I found myself truly laughing out loud, echoing off the walls of my kitchen. That’s when ‘LOL’ was first used,” Pearson writes. No other IRC slang or emoticon really captured “the fact that the other person just made you feel foolish by laughing out loud in a room all by yourself.”
But lately we use the acronym like Houellebecq does, not to express laughter, but to cast a bemused disdain on its target. Clearly, the “stars of the opposition” are utterly laughable in his mind. It’s not a giggle of amusement so much as a snort, a throwing-up-of-hands closer to the shruggie.
The meaning has shifted and intensified perhaps as the internet has become more depressing and less Utopian. We even have variations. For the extra-sarcastic, there’s the sighing despair lolllll (“I just got fired lollllll”) and the manic lololol (“Donald Trump!!! lolololol”). For friends I interact with on Gchat, it serves as punctuation to most sentences, a way to highlight the inherent absurdity of whatever we’re talking about, lol.
Here are the sounds you might expect a dog to make: barking, yelping, panting, loud sniffing.
Here are the sounds you do not expect a dog to make:
Yikes. Give it a rest, dude.
In depressing news that should shock absolutely no one, an investigative report into labor practices of Apple contractors in China found, among other things, that workers at factories run by Foxconn and Pegatron, both major suppliers of Apple, work over 60 hours a week — Apple’s stated cap — and make less than two dollars an hour.
The investigative group China Labor Watch, which provided its new report to The International Business Times, collected 1,200 pay stubs from workers at a Shanghai Pegatron factory in October. An analysis of the stubs shows that over 70 percent of the workers whose stubs were collected (there are 70,000 total in the factory) work more than 60 hours a week, which is the limit officially imposed by Apple on its suppliers.
In its 2015 Supplier Responsibility Progress Report, Apple, which has previously come under fire from China Labor Watch for previous, similar labor violations, said that it had achieved 92 percent compliance from suppliers on limiting workweeks to 60 hours. It declined to include more specific data about its suppliers, including what factories were responsible for the 8 percent of workweeks they found to be over 60 hours.
In 2010, Apple released an internal probe that found that many of its factories employed child labor and overworked employees, with pledges to stem labor violations. However, a 2014 BBC investigation into the same Shanghai Pegatron factory found violations similar to those found by China Labor Watch. In a comment to the BBC, Apple said that the average workweek at the factory is 55 hours.
China Labor Watch also found from the pay-stub analysis that workers for the Shanghai Pegatron factory make about $1.82 an hour.
Here are things that seemed very cool three years ago: vaping and Flappy Bird. “Ah, yes, 2013. Of course. The year of vaporized tobacco and the flapping bird,” wizened historians will say decades from now.
Three years later, FINALLY, somebody has managed to combine the two into the only device you’ll ever need. “I love vaping,” Balázs Bánk thought. “But it would be way better if I could play Flappy Bird on the tiny screen.”
Behold, the ultimate rig, a vape pen on which you can play Flappy Bird.
What a world. Anything is possible.
One of the stupidest things I’ve done in recent memory is preorder fast food. I don’t even know what I preordered. I did this today, when Taco Bell — the most social-media-savvy of the major fast-food chains — posted a link to a preorder page.
On the page is just a black box emblazoned with a question mark. I don’t even know what’s in the damn box, but I have committed to spending $2.99 to find out.
“You’ll get to taste it on Saturday, February 6. That’s two days before the rest of the world,” they say.
“Cool cool cool cool cool, can’t wait,” is what I say. “Extremely good stuff.”
This is the tech hell we live in. I gave my email address to a major food conglomerate so I could reserve a mystery food item, which I will be able to pick up using an app on my phone later this week. The process by which I order food (which, reminder, I need to live) is now the same process by which I might preorder the next Pokémon game. I will place the food in my mouth and let it travel down my esophagus. My body will then absorb any nutrients contained in the food and expel what’s left over.
Taco Bell is no stranger to viral food stunts, which are now a staple of their menu: the Doritos Locos Taco, the ill-fated waffle taco for breakfast, and so on and so forth, from now until the end of time, both in store and on the app.
Which of these revolting flesh slurries will I get to taste? Taco Bell Crunchwrap Slim Jim Slam Taco Bell Quesadilla Del Snickers Taco Bell Reverse Burrito Taco Bell Pepsi Carne A-Soda Steak Bubbler Taco Bell Monster Energy Charged-Up Chimichanga Taco Bell Egg Blast Taco Bell Haribo Cheese ’n Bean ’n Sour Spaghetti Gordita Chomper Taco Bell Ragu Limited Edition “Mama Mia!” Disgusting Taquitos Taco Bell Jello “Film From the Top of Jello” Nugs Taco Bell General Electric Pant Blaster Taco Bell Limited Edition Ru Paul Chalupa Taco Bell Reddit Dorito Dust Intravenous Flavor Drip Taco Bell Monsanto GMO OMG Taco Sliders Taco Bell DJ Khaled 🔑-Sadilla Taco Bell Very Very Verde Green Apple Churros Perezosos Taco Bell Nestlé Toll House Choco-Chalupa Slurp Zone
(The answer, in all likelihood, is a Quesalupa.)
The humble Rickroll has been with us for the better part of a decade now, one of the earliest examples of internet memes as we know them. Tricking suckers into watching a Rick Astley music video started out funny, was briefly political, and then took a slow slide into obscurity. Today, it’s basically a dad joke. It’s very literally something a goofball teacher would do to prank his cheating students.
Watch as a Penn State student peruses the final exam study materials for Information Science 210 — Organization of Data — and discovers a tempting file called “Final Exam Answer Key.” Needless to say, he’s a little let down by what he finds there.
Nicely played. Computer-science professors are no strangers to the Rickroll; students have been hiding Astley lyrics in their papers for years. Seems the instructors were just waiting for the right time to exact their revenge.
How many people does it take to produce a daily post and a handful of speeches about the ways that feminism threatens traditional video-game culture? At least 45, apparently: In a BuzzFeed article published Thursday night, Milo Yiannopoulos, the tech editor of Breitbart.com and a longtime Gamergate figure, acknowledged that he received help in his writing from dozens of “paid and unpaid” interns.
According to a couple of sources and video taken of an internal Slack chat called “PROJECT MILO,” 44 interns are allegedly responsible for producing most of the conservative commentator’s work — much of which falls somewhere between politically incorrect and outright hateful.
Anonymous sources for BuzzFeed were a bit more hyperbolic.
As Matt Yglesias points out, the practice of using interns more than just researchers is widespread in the hacky pundit world, and the idea that Yiannopoulos would place his byline and speech-writing obligations in the hands of a small army of (likely) adolescents is totally unsurprising. Still, it’s extremely funny, especially when you consider the sheer number of “interns” and the fact that they’re all hanging out in a Slack with discussion channels called #blackcock, #idolworship, and #swag. Even better are the things they talk about in the Slack: Among other things, Milo is forced to ask his hangers-on not to use the N-word in the Slack, in case transcripts leak. And then:
For the interns, though, there’s really no downside to this. It totally makes sense that 44 people — when presented with the opportunity to publish offensive things under someone else’s name on a popular website — seized the opportunity. And it’s working! Last November, Milo was in the running for Shittiest Twitter Account of 2015, before a vote-rigging scandal disqualified him.
Because it is the year 2016, I am going to assume one of two things. You either (a) have the emoji keyboard on your phone activated or (b) know how to activate it and are voluntarily abstaining. Point being, it is impossible to not know how to access emoji.
But there are other secrets tucked away on the iPhone, like the secret kaomoji keyboard — Japanese emoticons that can be read without tilting your head 90 degrees. Think ◕‿◕✿, not :-). They’re gaining popularity all over the world, as we noted a few months ago.
Finding the hidden keyboard is only slightly more difficult than finding the emoji one, according to Mashable. In the keyboard setting of your phone, select the option to add a new keyboard, and then select the Kana one listed under Japanese. The full drill down is Settings > General > Keyboard > Add New Keyboard > Japanese > Kana.
Once you have it installed, hit the button to the right of the microphone. It’s this one.
Then hit the up arrow at the top of the keyboard.
That’ll open up an entire gallery of goofy symbols.
Steven Joyce, New Zealand’s economic development minister, got a bit more than he expected this week when a protester hurled a dildo at him to signal her opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement.
After throwing the sex toy, the protester, Josie Butler, said, “That’s for raping our sovereignty.” She was taken away by police and later released without charges. Much of New Zealand’s Maori population opposed the trade deal, which was signed in Auckland earlier this week.
“[You have] new experiences in politics every day. It’s the privilege of serving,” Joyce told reporters. He later acknowledged the inherent virality of flying dildos, hoping to expedite the process.
Wherever you find yourself when the world eventually ends, you’ll hear about it from someone in a brightly colored pencil dress.
No matter where you go in the U.S., some things about local TV just don’t change: bad Sunday movies, Seinfeld in syndication, and meteorologists all wearing the same dress. Wait, what? What dress?
A collage on Imgur showed around 50 newscasters — mostly meteorologists — wearing different shades of the same brightly colored, long-sleeved pencil dress with black trim. A conspiracy, perhaps? A network-issued uniform for all those who would warn us of the coming El Niño?
Nay, just an Amazon bargain that was too good to pass up.
As Fox 4 Dallas’s Jennifer Myers explained on Facebook, someone tipped off a private Facebook group for meteorologists about the dress, and suddenly everyone had one, including Myers and her co-worker Jenny Anchondo.
They call it “THE dress” — although that evokes memories some of us have worked extremely hard to bury — but to Amazon it’s known as Homeyee Women’s Stretch Tunic Pencil Sheath Dress U837.
But what makes U837 so ubiquitous in TV news? It’s partly the business-casual vibe and the sleeves, North Carolina meteorologist Lyndsay Tapases told BuzzFeed. But it’s also the price: THE dress costs $22.99.
“Many of us don’t have a clothing allowance and are responsible for buying all of our own clothes,” Tapases pointed out.
To repeat, the head of one of the most popular science information pages on the world’s largest social network said explicitly, “I’m not trying to teach people about science.” So if all this time, you’ve been treating IFLScience as a credible news source, it might be time to think again. They don’t care about teaching you facts; they just want to pique your interest.
The internet is home to a great deal of dubious knowledge. It is a place where misinformation and bad sourcing proliferate unbounded. Many people know, objectively, that there’s a lot of fake stuff online. As the rapper Lil B once said, “THERE’S SOME STUFF ON THE INTERNET THAT IS REALLY BAD.”
But bad stuff on the net — despite being bad, and despite its audience being aware of the badness — can often be successful. Case in point, the Facebook page and website spinoff I Fucking Love Science, whose founder, Elise Andrew, was featured today in Time magazine’s list of the 30 Most Influential People on the Internet. The brand, with its 24.2 million fans, often posts the type of viral science “wins” that people love — cool pictures of space, crazy experiments, dinosaur discoveries.
It’s cool to be interested in science. Never let anyone tell you otherwise. “Fake science fans,” like “fake gamers,” are not a real thing. But people who get most of their news filtered through IFLScience are often doing themselves a disservice, and when they share those posts, they’re usually doing others a disservice as well.
As Joe Veix wrote in 2014:
As the site Skepchick covered last year, “Andrew has gone from a modern pop sci champion to contributing to the very media misinformation that scientists work hard to combat.” The site is consistently criticized for willful misrepresentation of the science that it claims to “fucking love.” (Full disclosure: Earlier today, I myself published a piece called “If This Blog Post Loads Too Slowly, Your Heart Will Explode,” which I pray was ridiculous enough that people realized it was a joke.)
Speaking to the claims of inaccuracy and fair-weather fandom surrounding the page, Andrew offered up this astoundingly terrible perspective:
It’s clear these events had an effect on Owens. “The age of technology and social media has slowly disintegrated individual accountability, the consequences of which are devastating,” she says in Social Autopsy’s promotional video, which then rolls news coverage of a series of suicides that may have been caused, at least in part, by cyberbullying. She then explains what Social Autopsy will do: “We attach [people’s] words to their places of employment, and anybody in the entire world can search for them. What we are doing is figuratively lifting the masks up so nobody can hide behind, you know, Twitter handles or privatized profiles. It’s all real, and it’s all researchable. You can still say whatever you want to say on social media, but you have to be willing to stand by your words.” According to the Kickstarter, the company is seeking $75,000 in funding and hopes to launch with 150,000 profiles.
The pitch, to anyone steeped in the world of social media in 2016, is odd, if not ominous. Owens is unclear how she plans to do any of the things she says she will, and listening to her description of a site that “lifts masks” and connects people’s names to their employers, it’s hard not to come to the conclusion that Social Autopsy’s goals include de-anonymizing people online and making it easier to dox trolls and harassers. And that’s exactly how the Kickstarter pitch was interpreted by most of the people who saw it. The freak-out was both immediate and predictable — a site that allows users to “report” people for entry in a database that will portray them as a troll or a cyberbully has obvious potential for all kinds of abuse.
In the days that followed, a rare degree of unity was achieved between various opposing factions in the endless internet culture wars: Gamergater and anti-Gamergate advocate alike agreed that this was a very bad idea, and that the Kickstarter’s lack of details — when it launched, there was little sign the company had given any thoughts to potential privacy concerns, nor to countermeasures against the inevitability of reports leveled against innocent people — suggested it was a half-baked, potentially dangerous service that no one really wanted.
The response to Social Autopsy seemed, in short, like a clear instance of the internet — that is, the market for the service itself — rearing up and issuing forth a guttural, earsplitting No thanks! But that’s not how Owens sees things. Instead, she’s convinced the current online shaming she’s experiencing — including death threats and violently racist language delivered into her company’s inbox — are the result of a conspiracy, possibly a far-reaching one, spearheaded by Quinn and Harper. She thinks they, and particularly Quinn, are the ones sending her nasty email, or that they started the hysteria which led to the inundation, at least. She also thinks they’re operating a network of sock-puppet social-media accounts trying to take down Social Autopsy — all because they’re afraid of what the nascent company will reveal about them once it’s up and running.
There is no actual evidence any of this is true, and yet Owens, thrust into an internet culture war she knew nothing about coming in, has misinterpreted, in a particularly cringeworthy way, various bits of mundane “evidence” as implicating Quinn and Harper. She has accidentally become a true believer in a common variety of Gamergate conspiracy — all without even really knowing what Gamergate is. And she’s convinced she’s about to break the whole thing open in a big blog post she plans to publish on her website, degree180.com, later today.
It all started with an email from Zoe Quinn to Owens the evening of the Kickstarter launch. For the uninitiated, Quinn is the original victim of Gamergate. Her ex-boyfriend Eron Gjoni effectively launched the entire online movement with a lengthy, vindictive blog post he published about her, in August of 2014, leading to a cascade of harassment and death threats that has never fully abated since.
She had expressed concerns about Social Autopsy on Twitter, and soon an Autopsy intern gave her Owens’s personal work email address. (Quinn is a co-founder of Crash Override Network, a “crisis helpline, advocacy group and resource center for people who are experiencing online abuse.” With the exception of a few instances in which she responded to individual claims below, Quinn said in a DM statement she didn’t want to comment on the particulars of her interactions with Owens. “It’s unfortunate that the public conversation that could have been about the project and the underlying merits of different tactics of fighting against online abuse has been largely hijacked by people acting in bad faith hoping to cause a spectacle,” the statement read in part, “and I have no interest in allowing myself to be used for that.”)
If you stumbled upon the Twitter account @socialcoroner over the weekend, you might have immediately assumed it was being run by a type that’s become sadly familiar online: the hard-line Gamergater. If you spend enough time on Twitter or Reddit, you run into these folks occasionally: sitting at the far end of the obsessiveness bell curve, these are the dudes (and they’re mostly dudes) convinced that a cabal of feminist “social-justice warriors,” or SJWs, are controlling everything from behind the scenes, viciously targeting their enemies and punishing them for not toeing an imagined wacko-progressive line.
Shortly after Quinn initiated email contact, the two women were on the phone. It didn’t go well. Owens said she found Quinn “pompous” and that she didn’t think Quinn’s concerns, which varied from the potential of children getting doxxed by Social Autopsy to the threat she thought Gamergate posed to Owens herself, were well-founded. Quinn, Owens also told me, said she was calling on behalf of a group of anti-bullying organizations, but wouldn’t say which ones. Things got increasingly heated, and then Quinn broke into tears and said something like “I don’t think you understand — this is going to ruin everything!” Owens said she found it odd and suspicious that Quinn started crying, especially given that she was calling as a representative of various organizations. After they got off the phone, the two had a brief email correspondence which culminated, Owens said, in Quinn asking her not to contact her again. (In a DM conversation, Quinn acknowledged she had teared up, but denied saying anything that Owens could have interpreted as “This is going to ruin everything!” She also denied having claimed to be speaking for anyone other than herself.)
About 45 minutes after Quinn sent her final email, Owens said she started receiving racist hate mail at the main Kickstarter contact email for Social Autopsy, and at her own personal email — the first email she received simply said “NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER” (Owens is African-American). It soon became a deluge of harassment, some of it violent, with many of the fake email addresses the harassers used containing words like “gaming” or a variation thereof. “I spent an entire night being harassed — I couldn’t even answer the real questions from people that were coming from our Kickstarter campaign,” said Owens. Here are some of the messages she received, which are quite graphic:
By the time I spoke with her on Saturday night, Owens had convinced herself that it was Quinn sending her at least some of those harassing notes. For one thing, she found the fake handles suspicious. Gaming was “an industry and a community that I had, prior to talking to Zoe Quinn, no idea about — they were not on our radar.” It also seemed a little too pat that Quinn had warned her there would be a wave of harassment and then, voilà, there was a wave of harassment, especially given that the Kickstarter had been operating for the better part of a day with nary a critique from haters. I pressed Owens on this: she really thought Quinn sent her the “NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER” note, and the other over-the-top hateful ones? “She sent or knew who sent them,” she responded. “100 percent undeniable.” The belief seems to hinge almost entirely on the facts that the abusive emails came in after she spoke with Quinn, and that both Quinn and some of the notes mentioned gamers.
Owens said she woke up furious the next day, and saw she had received an email in the personal work account that Quinn had been given, “which to me said ‘red flag, this is Zoe Quinn’” (it should be pointed out that Owens’s work account is not hard to figure out). The email linked to a thread on 4chan’s /pol/ board, which is notorious for its reactionary politics and offensive trollery, in which users teed off on Social Autopsy and what a bad idea it was. “So don’t say no one warned you,” the author of that email wrote, “but seriously you need to take the time to read the whole thread do not dismiss this, it will only hurt you in the future if you do.” Soon after that, Owens noticed someone had posted about Social Autopsy on Reddit as well, and soon after that that someone had created a fake social-media account on Twitter — “sociaIautopsy” with a capital I instead of an L, to trick people. Owens attributed just about all of this to Quinn and her allies.
Another big piece of evidence Owens highlights as proof of a conspiracy to take down her company is the “Open Letter to Social Autopsy” posted to Medium by a well-known Gamergate critic named Randi Lee Harper. In the letter, Harper, a frequent Gamergate target and anti-harassment advocate herself, tore into Owens for wandering into a situation she didn’t fully understand (Harper noted that at one point Owens referred to Quinn as a Gamergate leader — this is kind of like referring to Obama as a big tea-party activist). Harper didn’t hold back. “I’m telling you my credentials so you can understand where I’m coming from when I tell you, unequivocally, you are a goddamn trainwreck,” she wrote at one point. Later: “You are a fucking idiot.” Then, referring to the fact that Kickstarter suspended funding for Social Autopsy: “You blamed your Kickstarter getting shut down on trolls. You’re wrong. That was us. As long as you’re willfully harming other people by creating shitty uninformed products while kicking the shit out of anyone that tries to help you, we’re going to keep getting you shut down.”
To Owens, this level of anger just didn’t make sense — there had to be something else going on. “I started piecing it together, and I was like, Oh my God, this is actually who these people are — this is crazy,” she said. To find out more, she started researching Quinn’s and Harper’s names. Quickly she collided headfirst with a key point of Gamergate orthodoxy: Many online harassment victims — particularly “professional victims” like Quinn and Harper — are making up or exaggerating the harassment against them. Hardcore Gamergaters even think Quinn, Harper, or both run elaborate ruses to try to convince the world they are under online attack when in fact they aren’t. (Part of what makes these theories so hard to believe is that if you Google either name, you can see that a disturbing number of people have been utterly obsessed with both women — particularly Quinn — since Gamergate broke. Given the sheer heat that has been blasted at them for so long, it would be bizarre if they hadn’t been hit by wave after wave of abuse and threats.) In a DM statement, Harper said, in part, “This isn’t the first project that was likely well intentioned but lacked research into both technology as well as the psychology of harassment … Without that collective knowledge base and support [of the preexisting members of the online anti-harassment community], anyone entering this new tech sector is going to have a difficult time.”
This is a striking example of how successfully Gamergate has tarred two of its targets. Owens, new to the controversy and just trying to understand more about the women who had criticized her, quickly became convinced that Quinn and Harper were some sort of internet supervillains. Lacking the full context of the Gamergate story, and reading a trove of information which all seemed to confirm her suspicions, Owens fell in deeper. She felt her instincts about Quinn had been confirmed. “I started reading obviously more into it, [about how] people had suspected this for a while, that [Quinn] is actually making money,” she said. “And that Randi doxxes people … they had a tweet saved of her calling for somebody’s address and telephone number [this refers to an instance in which Harper released personal information about a debt collector]. These two are like cohorts, they’re going back and forth, and they plan, and each of them has their own network — they both have a big following — I still do not know, admittedly, why Randi Lee Harper is, I do not know why I got an open letter from her. All I know is that she crafted the entire thing for me. Their network runs deep. So who knows? I don’t know how deep this goes.”
***
Two common targets of this sort of obsession — and, broadly speaking, two of Gamergate’s biggest bête noires — are the anti-harassment advocates Zoe Quinn and Randi Lee Harper. And, indeed, they were exactly who @socialcoroner went after.
Part of what has made this train wreck so depressing to watch is that almost all of it flows directly out of Owens’s lack of understanding of this particular slice of the internet. She may have worked with various anti-bullying organizations like the Tyler Clementi Foundation in the run-up to her Kickstarter launch, but it was clear from our conversation that she just hadn’t been exposed to the kind of aggressive swarming mobs that define online harassment in 2016. When we were talking about Social Autopsy, her primary examples of the behavior she was hoping to catalogue were people who left threatening Facebook comments about celebrities like Caitlyn Jenner. She thought it was important to discover, for example, the names of teachers who left viciously cruel comments against Jenner.
Yes, people leave mean comments on Facebook, and, yes, there is plenty of “old-school” cyberbullying that should be addressed, but online harassment these days is much more complicated than that — much more complicated even than the brutal, scary version Owens experienced growing up. Understanding it requires understanding a lot about anonymity, about troll culture, about who is likely to be a target in a first place. And it doesn’t appear Owens or her colleagues at Social Autopsy came in with any of this background. As if the internet were trying to hammer that point home, Owens and her organization are now experiencing exactly the sort of harassment her organization didn’t seem to fully take into account — the snowballing shaming which can come when an unpopular idea is put under a searing spotlight and the internet decides that the most important thing in the world to do, at least for the next day or so — or until some other, even more deserving victim comes along — is to mock and threaten and dehumanize whoever is responsible for that idea.
Owens’s somewhat naive understanding of what constitutes online harassment ended up backfiring on her in some pretty brutal ways. For instance, she got fixated on the word dox, mentioning that Quinn had used it in their tense phone call. “Within a few hours of having spoken to Zoe Quinn and upset her, a board has been started on us on 4chan.org, an anonymous thread, and they are now telling the gamers that we are going to be doxxing them, doxxing minors,” she told me. “The word dox is being thrown around — [I] had never heard it, people had seen our campaign, we worked on it for two months, people gave us feedback, we had a whole article written in the Connecticut Post on the front page” — and yet, she said, not a single person had used the word dox in the run-up to the Kickstarter launch. “Now we’re seeing the word dox in this chain and immediately in my head I go, Interesting word. Heard that first from Zoe.” So because Quinn had mentioned doxxing and then a bunch of other people had brought it up as well — in the context of a Kickstarter campaign that at the very least strongly hinted that it would be doxxing people by unmasking people and revealing where they work — Owens became convinced that Quinn was behind all the complaints.
This happened over and over. Owens kept mentioning pieces of “evidence” that were just … well, the way things work online. But to her, they could only be a sign of a campaign by Quinn and Harper against her. Owens repeatedly circled back to the sheer volume of anti-Social Autopsy content she’d witnessed, and the timing of it — a firestorm of vitriol that followed the pattern of every Twitter and Reddit pile-on of the last several years, where someone says or does something, there is a brief pause while news of it spreads, and then there’s a sudden explosion. Owens found it suspicious that there had been a lag time between the Kickstarter going up and the harassment wave, and that so many people seemed profoundly upset with her project. “I’m thinking, even if I disagreed with something that was on Kickstarter, the amount of time people are investing should have been an immediate red flag to me,” she said. “No matter what you disagree with, you do not text and post for 24 hours regarding it unless you have a personal investment in it the matter. You don’t — especially if it doesn’t even exist yet. We’re in Kickstarter.” Owens also found it incredibly suspicious that people were tweeting complaints at the FBI and other authorities — which, again, is a common tactic during just about every internet outrage. But to Owens: Why would anyone do that unless they had a very personal interest in stopping Social Autopsy? At another point, she noted that one critic hailed all the way from the U.K.“What blogger has an interest in this all the way in the United Kingdom, talking trash about us? It makes no sense.”
During our DM chats following our phone conversation, she also kept getting hung up on anonymity — she found it highly suspicious, and indicative of a possible conspiracy, that so many people were bashing her anonymously. “If you don’t use your real name on Twitter why do you have SO many followers?” she asked me at one point. At another, Owens said she was pretty sure one particular account was in on the conspiracy because when she tweeted at them asking them to reveal their real name (only to her), they refused to do so.
Eventually, Owens came to believe that a group of the Twitter accounts tweeting at her were all either controlled by Harper and Quinn directly, or were colluding with them to attack Social Autopsy. I asked her to show me some of the accounts she thought were in on it and she mentioned @iglvzx, or Izzy Galvez — a well-known-within-the-community anti-Gamergate figure who had been tweeted repeatedly about Social Autopsy over the Kickstarter launch. He is only “controlled by” Harper and Quinn in the sense that he tweets a lot about online harassment. This is exactly the sort of thing he’d have a strong opinion about. If you possess some background about Gamergate, Izzy Galvez tweeting about a company like Social Autopsy is as surprising and suspicious as Bernie Sanders saying something negative about big banks.
Pulling all her suspicions together, Owens laid out her full theory. She is convinced, based on a series of escalating misconceptions about how social media works, mixed with a dose of exposure to the Gamergate literature (and some helpful input from the Gamergate supporters who have been following her tweetstorms), that Quinn and Harper are making a lot of money by faking harassment against themselves to boost concern about the issue, and that they were worried Social Autopsy would blow their cover. The funny thing, Owens told me, is that her company’s initial plan was to draw on data from public profiles anyway — so Quinn’s sock puppets would have been safe (again, the Kickstarter’s “mask-lifting” language rendered this point rather fuzzy). But now, she said, she has different plans: She wants Social Autopsy to get more technologically ambitious, and to use it to tear down the entire Quinn/Harper ring of sock-puppet accounts and fake harassment.
Owens seems to have trouble accepting that her idea simply wasn’t well-received by, well, anyone. Only a conspiracy can explain what’s going on. “Everything happened all at once,” she said. “Things don’t go viral like that, okay? It wasn’t viral. It was contained. It was contained within one community — the gaming community. That’s not how viral works. Viral’s viral.”
Owens’s Twitter rants lasted a big chunk of the weekend. Sometimes, she called out Quinn and Harper directly. Other times she retweeted questions and comments from the Gamergaters who were eying her cautiously, wondering if she could be a useful ally (so many different threads about her were started at KotakuInAction, Gamergate’s Reddit headquarters, that mods there created a stickied “Candace Owens/SocialAutopsy Megathread”). She gave an audio interview to the Ralph Retort, a far-right blog that has joined in on dogpiles against Gamergate targets in the past. A couple times, she tweeted out a “#Gamergatesequel” hashtag, not understanding how that might look to the people who have been involved in that controversy for a year and a half and who naturally get angry or excited at anything GG-related. (“#Gamergatesequel. Coming to a theatre near you, Monday April 18th,” she wrote, referring to her upcoming big blog post exposé). Naturally, Quinn and Harper’s enemies relished the fact that the anti-harassment movement seemed to be eating itself, and that, in their eyes, a newcomer to this endless fight had “exposed” Gamergate’s enemies for who they are.
As a result of her accidental slide into internet obsession, at a time when she could be figuring out how to address the numerous valid concerns the public has raised about her company, Owens is instead focusing, laser-like, on unraveling a conspiracy that exists only in the eyes of fevered Gamergaters and men’ rights activists. “It makes no sense,” she said of the outcry against Social Autopsy. “I’m telling you — there is a whole network that I’m pretty convinced … it really is Gamergate, but it’s bigger than Gamergate. Because the implications of it are so much heavier. How many organizations do this? How many organizations stand up on a stage … and make sure this problem never fucking dies [by faking harassment]?” She’s going to get to the bottom of this — she wants to position Social Autopsy in the vanguard of the fight against Quinn, Harper, and their nefarious allies.
So overall, Social Autopsy’s Kickstarter rollout has not been without its hiccups.
For a large chunk of the weekend, the account came hard at both women, implying they were part of a conspiracy that was about to be unmasked. At times, the account sounded like it was tweeting from a besieged bunker, with the armies of Quinn and Harper closing in: “Randi & Zoe: stop sending your clowns to try and scare us with ‘legal hell’ threats. If you’re going to serve us, do it already!” It could be, unsurprisingly, hard to follow. But @socialcoroner repeatedly asserted its superiority over its alleged tormentors. “I consider the constructs of our society thoroughly, and often. I think analytically. Randi and Zoe really banked on my being dumb,” it tweeted at one point. “Keep sending the troops Randi & Zo. xx,” at another. Throughout, the conspiracy-talk was thick. Responding to another user, @socialcoroner wrote that “It’s literally a puzzle. The picture is obvious but fitting the pieces will take time.” Over the course of two tweets (separated by one in between): “Everyone PAY ATTENTION to the mentions… They are literally exposing themselves in the mentions. We can trace this all back to the origins.”
On the one hand: yawn. Sadly, these sorts of claims are dime a dozen on Twitter. On the other hand: @socialcoroner is the official Twitter account of Social Autopsy, an anti-bullying start-up that launched its Kickstarter last week, and the rant against Quinn and Harper garnered it hundreds of new followers. Quinn and Harper are very strange targets for an organization like this: Generally speaking, there is almost zero overlap between the sorts of people who publicly and repeatedly denounce those two particular women and the sorts of people concerned with ending online harassment. What the hell is going on here?
It’s a strange, slightly complicated story — but it’s also a useful cautionary tale about what can happen when newcomers wander into the weirder, angrier corners of the internet without first reading a tour guide or two.
Social Autopsy launched its Kickstarter campaign on April 12, billing itself as a way to catalogue the abuses of trolls and cyberbullies. Its founder is Candace Owens, a 26-year-old woman with a background in finance who has painful firsthand experience with bullying — when she was in high school in Stamford, Connecticut, a classmate and former friend left racist death threats on her phone, sparking a local scandal that came to ensnare the mayor and his son, the latter of whom was in a car with the perpetrator at the time he threatened Owens.
A new Australian study has concluded that harassing women online could become “an established norm in our digital society” if online behavior continues in its current mode. Almost half of 1,000 respondents said that they had been harassed online. That number rose to 76 percent when considering only women under 30.
One in seven respondents had been threatened with physical violence, though harassment ran the gamut from “unwanted contact, trolling, and cyberbullying to sexual harassment and threats of rape and death.” Women received, according to the data, “twice as many death threats and threats of sexual violence as men.”
The form that harassment came in was weighted heavily toward social media, where two-thirds of harassment originated. Email and text messaging accounted for 22 and 17 percent, respectively.
Calls for social-media companies to introduce better protections against harassment have gotten louder over the last year or so, as more terrible people (mostly men) sign up for accounts. At South by Southwest next week, a summit on online harassment will convene to discuss the issue.
There’s nothing to dislike about Jullien’s peace sign — it’s succinct, positive, and transparent. Like any good meme, it reproduces itself on protest signs and T-shirts, spawning riffs and remixes. “It’s an image for everyone. It’s a communication tool for people to express solidarity and peace and that’s what it’s being used for,” Jullien told Wired. “I think people have an instinctive sense of how to use these forms of communication. In cases like this, the things that need to spread, spread.” (Annie Galvin of 3 Fish Studios in San Francisco, who made one popular riff on the California bear meme, declined to comment on the image’s popularity after the tragedy.)
Social media may speed the process of image-focused public grieving, but it didn’t start there. In the aftermath of 9/11, Milton Glaser’s iconic I Love New York More Than Ever later appeared on posters and T-shirts. The content doesn’t matter so much as the vehicle. The grief meme has to be easily accessible, easily repostable, and as catchy as an ad slogan.
This kind of advertising-like frictionless lends a certain tension to the grief meme — does it actually help us express emotion, or is it just a glib way to place ourselves at the center of tragedy? The answer is some combination of both.
We value posting the image because speech is cynical, and a picture can mean whatever we want without us having to verbalize it, at the risk of offending some of our audiences on social networks. The desire for such a meme is a natural and valid reaction to incidents that seem like they come from nowhere, though they come from us, and strike the entire country with inarticulate tragedy. The victims are in such pain, politicians don’t care, and no amount of media coverage helps. We turn to grief memes when words fail our feelings, when we are yearning to address something that no writing of our own can quite embody, but we want to share in it anyway.
Still, there’s a deadening quality when the same image or phrase is repeated so many times over. It gradually loses its punch, even if every post is meant sincerely. I would argue this is because the grief meme has more utility to its user than its consumer — that is, it means more to post and share the meme than it does to see it.
After the San Bernardino shooting, an image started picking up steam on Facebook and other social networks: a picture of a bear hugging the state of California. Though it has the twee aesthetic of a heartfelt millennial meme, it’s actually a drawing from 1913, off a set of sheet music for the state song, “I Love You, California.”
It’s the latest simple illustration to take over social media in the wake of a major tragedy. In the hours after 130 people were shot and killed in Paris, Facebook was filled with shared sketches of a peace symbol containing the Eiffel tower, an image by the French artist Jean Jullien, to say nothing of the millions of Facebook profile pictures given a tricolore overlay. After the shootings at Charlie Hebdo earlier this year, Instagram and Facebook lit up with a cartoon by the French artist Lucille Clerc, mistakenly attributed to Banksy.
It’s understandable to take to social media to respond to tragedy, even if it does sometimes seem shallow or hollow — we’re conditioned now to perform our emotions and reactions on public platforms, and the experience of watching horror on the news can give rise to a peculiar sensation of alienation and helplessness that can sometimes only be cured with small, seemingly meaningless actions. (The Onion nailed this feeling with its classic post-9/11 piece “Not Knowing What Else to Do, Woman Bakes American-Flag Cake.”) But why this recent emphasis on illustration and art?
Reposting the California bear image provides an easy shortcut for us to express ourselves online in a situation where saying much of anything is difficult (as is spelling: the most popular iteration of the hugging-bear image offered solace for San Bernadino, not San Bernardino). We have to do something. Social media constantly urges us to speak, to discuss what’s going on in the world around us with our friends and followers. But weighing in with strong opinions in the midst of a breaking-news event, when Twitter spectators thousands of miles away don’t even know what’s going on, is usually unwise. Tweeting an adage about “thoughts and prayers” might demonstrate that we’re aware of the situation without passing judgment on any party. But “prayers” are as fraught as anything else. The adage might be a way to fake action rather than express sincere solidarity, or simply have your intentions misunderstood. Who are you praying for, and are you actually praying? (Or are you “prayer-shaming”?)
Visual art, on the other hand, has become a perfect meme of grief. The web is an inherently visual medium, and when you’re being assaulted with unbearably sad text updates or horrifying photographs, a smartly presented image can feel like a respite from the cruelties of the word. A good illustration can demonstrate awareness, sympathy, and solidarity with victims, without taking sides or expressing ideological opinion. Many of the image memes are hokey, yes, but hokiness is forgivable in the face of expediency.
The grief meme goes way beyond the California bear. We’ve long trusted visual art to comfort and speak for us in trying times. You’d have some trouble sharing Picasso’s Guernica, since it’s on a 25-foot canvas, but the artist’s iconic peace doves have become, well, icons. The California bear and the Paris peace sign might not appear in the Prado anytime soon, but they serve fundamentally different functions than museum pieces.
So, to recap: A powerful online casino is bankrolling a scrappy uprising against the most powerful coalition in the Eve galaxy, and thousands of players (and thousands of dollars) are at stake. And it’s not over yet. Isn’t the internet cool?
Just in case none of that made sense, here’s how the excellent Reddit primer on the matter describes it:
There’s an enormous war going on as we speak. A shady consortium of casino bankers is funding a rebel coalition’s desperate fight against an arrogant would-be empire. In space. Not real space — in the space of Eve Online, a massively multiplayer online game (or MMO) whose enormous, intricate battles gather thousands of players and cost real-world money. As you check your email and surf Twitter and Facebook in your corner of the web, people around the world are gearing up for battle in another.
This week, what is potentially the largest war in Eve history kicked off with what might be its biggest battle ever. The war revolves around resentment and animosity toward the largest of the game’s many organized alliances, the Clusterfuck Coalition (CFC), which recently dubbed itself the Imperium and began, in the style of a classic empire, demanding its neighboring territories swear fealty and pay taxes. “Over the past few years” — yes, Eve’s ongoing power struggles span years — “a growing sense of unease has been brewing among the Eve community,” writes Polygon. Among them: “a series of tithing agreements, whereby The Imperium allowed other player-led coalitions to pay them regular sums of money in exchange for ‘protection.’”
If this sounds hugely nerdy, it is. Eve is an extremely popular game, but its complexity also makes it difficult to begin playing, or to even explain in simple terms. It’s notoriously intricate and, in many ways, boring; Game play is a lot more outfitting and allocating resources, and a lot less pretending you’re flying a spaceship. (If you’re curious, there’s an enormous body of YouTube videos showing people playing the game.) It’s often referred to as a “spreadsheet simulator,” since the highest level of play tends to involve administering its complex systems. Players at its highest level spend more time managing their teams and factions outside of the actual game client than actually playing. But this nerdy complexity also makes it fascinating. Unlike more individualized MMOs like World of Warcraft, Eve, with its complex alliances and power struggles, has, in a real way, a history. When fights flare up and ships are destroyed permanently, the cost of battles can often be measured in real-world value.
So the main thing to know is that thousands of people are coordinating enormous space fights that might actually cost them real-world money.
Recently, the CFC tried to take over a supposedly weaker area of space known as Low Sec, but they went in unprepared and got their butts whooped. At this point, many other factions realized that if they put aside their differences and went after CFC together, they might be able to free themselves from the yoke of the Imperium. These groups banded together to form Low Sec Voltron (LSV).
This apparent demonstration of CFC’s weakness also attracted the attention of I Want Isk, a gambling organization that runs a third-party casino at which players can gamble Eve’s in-game virtual currency, Isk. IWI was already engaged in a dispute with some subgroups of CFC, and had been hiring mercenaries to attack them; now, in the wake of CFC’s surprising defeat, the casino moguls have elected to bankroll the Low Sec Voltron crew — now banded together as Money Badger Coalition.
Let’s break down this screenshot of a Call of Duty stream.
On the left side is a stream of social-media mentions being piped in, above a banner of rotating usernames on other platforms.
On the right side, working top to bottom, is a video feed of the streamer, xMinks, playing the game. Below that is a grid of various economic metrics that commonly appear in the feeds of top streamers: the top donor of the day (customized to refer to them as “top llama”) and the amount that they donated, the name of the last person to subscribe, the name of the most recent donor and their contribution, and a goal for new subscriptions — currently six-tenths of the way there — leading to an incentive (in this case, a “wheel spin,” though I’m not clear on what that means specifically).
At the bottom is a banner featuring other social metrics: the name of the most recent follower (an act different from subscribing; it’s free), a counter of the number of new followers that day, and the name of the top monthly donor. On the left side of the banner is the name of a sponsor; in this case, it’s Astro, a gaming-headset manufacturer.
This is all in addition to the HUD elements that are actually part of the game: a ticker of kills, a minimap, a scoreboard, and an ammo count. This is a ton of information to throw at a viewer, and it’s always visually customized in a way that is specific to the streamer’s personal brand.
Here is a Minecraft streamer that includes many of the UI elements mentioned above as well as some new ones.
In the lower-left corner is a fund-raising thermometer. In this case, the streamer is raising funds for a Logitech C920 USB HD. At the top-center is a ticker displaying the current music track being played — it’s Avicii — an added aural customization impossible to convey in screenshots (much like the auto-play music of yore).
When users began fleeing Myspace for Facebook roughly a decade ago, the general consensus was that Facebook’s big advantage, besides its exclusivity, was design. Facebook helped usher in a sort of “white picket fence” era of the web, in which uniformity reigned, and profile “hacks” were unnecessary and impossible. Gone were the Blingees, the auto-playing music embeds, the Comic Sans and worse fonts. In their place were profiles that looked structurally and visually identical.
At the bottom of this stream for Counter-Strike are ads for stream sponsors, which are often gaming-equipment manufacturers and sellers like G2A and the aforementioned Astro.
This stream features another common Twitch feature. That penguin in the upper-left is a pop-up animation that appears whenever a new user follows the channel. The penguin is a custom flourish much like every other HUD element on Twitch streams. Some streams, in addition to in-game chat, also feature the text of the Twitch chat room running inside the frame.
Marcus “djWheat” Graham, Twitch’s head of programming, explained to me over the phone that all of these stream HUD elements — webcam picture-in-picture, chat-room functionality, follower pop-ups, etc. — came about organically over time as livestreaming game play gained popularity, cobbled-together kludges that echo the build-it-yourself culture of the early web. “At the end of the day,” he said, “Twitch has really not been the innovator of this at all; it’s just been the innovation of the users who have said, ‘You know what? This is great, it’s cool, I think I might be able to do it better.’ And once one user does it, there tends to be this trickle-down effect.”
If we think of Twitch as the Myspace of livestreaming — with a clear basic template that offers near-infinite visual customization — then what is livestreaming’s Facebook? Right now, there isn’t one. Apps like Periscope feature an analogous form, a continuous stream of comments and textual information laid directly onto the video stream, though it looks identical between users and slightly cleaner because Periscope is restricted to mobile devices. There is no way to pipe in video through anything other than the device’s camera.
There have been attempts at introducing first-party uniformity to online video. The most well-known instance being YouTube annotations, which were created with the best of intentions. In June of 2008, at the feature’s launch, Google said that annotations could be used “to add background information about the video, create stories with multiple possibilities (viewers click to choose the next scene), or link to related YouTube videos, channels, or search results from within a video.” And while some annotations were used in this way, the feature was often abused, creating a glut of text boxes and invisible link bubbles. Annotations were flat-out ugly. A TechCrunch headline six months after the feature’s introduction read, “Adding YouTube Annotations Just Got Easy. I’ve Got A Bad Feeling About This …”
In early 2015, YouTube introduced “Cards,” which it positioned as a successor to annotations. Unsurprisingly, their usage is more tightly controlled — they don’t appear automatically like annotations do (users have to click for more info), and their overlaid positioning is uniform. There are obvious reasons for reining in the usage of annotations — a cleaner look, and a more uniform mode of viewer interactivity will theoretically drive more clicks to ads, to channels, etc. If you know how to interact with one video, you know how to interact with them all.
But YouTube’s annotation system doesn’t really work for livestreaming, because the data contained within annotations is static. On livestreaming services like Twitch, variables are constantly changing and data points are always streaming in: new comments, new followers, new donations. That’s a heavier load to bear in terms of both technical processing and audience understanding.
I asked Twitch if they were thinking about first-party broadcasting tools that might allow for more uniformity. On some level, Twitch already offers apps on Xbox and PlayStation consoles that lack the customization options of a roll-your-own third-party solution. “Have we talked about having our own broadcast software? Of course, it’s come up many, many, many times,” Graham says. “Have we talked about building some of our own tools? It has, but at the same time, Twitch really supports and gets behind the sort of ecosystem that has been created around Twitch streams and all of the folks who have used their expertise to make tools that benefit our streamers.” The focus, as of now, is on letting users do their thing. That could change overnight, depending on the whims of the audience or Twitch’s parent company, Amazon — Twitter famously nerfed its third party in order to exercise greater platform control — but there is little sense that Twitch is inching toward the same idea in terms of video.
The early web aesthetic, best typified by Geocities and later by Myspace, prized owner customization over audience usability. The most important thing about your little corner of the web was that it satisfied you, rather than your visitors. People need to hear this MIDI version of Yellowcard’s “Ocean Avenue” when they visit my page — who cares if it makes for a terrible user experience?
Graham isn’t concerned about users fleeing for cleaner pastures. “I think that more than anything, people want more flexibility and customization,” he said. He also noted that the service’s main demographic — the 15–35 range — is used to what might be incorrectly referred to as "information overload" at this point. “We use the internet every day, we’re distracted every 30 seconds by what we do. I would actually potentially argue that in this day and age, our user base is used to having a plethora of information fly out from their monitor and right into their brain.” There’s a learning curve to figuring out the HUD elements and interaction loops of a Twitch stream, but the learning curve isn’t particularly steep for digital natives. The system is not nearly as confusing as it might seem at first glance, similar to how a financial news channel like CNBC might fill its frame with market metrics. For livestreamers, those metrics aren’t related to money, they’re related to interaction.
As video — and livestreaming in particular — grows in popularity on the web, we can expect to see more of this: people becoming their own professional broadcasting operations, warping and tweaking the aesthetic of their stream to fit their brand in a way similar to a cable news channel, and piling loads of extraneous information into the frame. This is exciting! The idea that users want a tidy, uniform experience across a service is mostly an idea clung to by technologists — the average social-media user doesn’t care about cleanliness. If they did, we wouldn’t be seeing an astonishing amount of compression rot in the multimedia passed around on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and Tumblr.
Twitch is, as of now, the best indication yet that the web is ebbing back toward Myspace on the Myspace-Facebook spectrum. The reasons for this are both technological — rendering and processing video is expensive — and cultural. As more and more people come of age using the web and using technology, uniformity in design and aesthetic isn’t as necessary. Facebook emerged as a service friendly to people who had never used a social network before, and that population is rapidly dwindling. We’re moving toward visual cacophony because we now have the ability to parse that mess easily. That beautiful mess is something to look forward to.
The uniformity of Facebook profiles (and Twitter profiles, and those of most modern social networks) solved this problem by taking all that customization away. You couldn’t tweak your profile’s layout, or add auto-play music, or even add GIFs. Cover photos do a bit to spice things up, but not much. And, despite some growing pains, the homogeneity of Web 2.0 means web surfers rarely have to worry about loading a page and getting served bad fonts, low-res images, and tags. It’s a much cleaner experience for the user, especially on the smaller and slower mobile browsers that have become increasingly common — and it’s a much more profitable experience for the companies that own these social networks, which can segment audiences and sell ads much more easily.
But we’re entering an age that’s moving away from text and static images and toward multimedia — video specifically — that threatens to upend web aesthetics yet again. Unless they want to accept the substantial costs associated with processing video, platforms are powerless in compelling users to adhere to any sort of style guide or uniformity. Online video is the new Myspace, and it’s chaotic and cluttered and garish, and I love it.
If it’s not already, video — rather than text — will become the lion’s share of the content you consume and share online relatively soon. It began with YouTube, but Facebook and Twitter are now also pushing native video platforms, and Snapchat’s far-reaching Discover section has proved a boon to publishers as well. Livestreaming services like Periscope and Twitch are becoming more en vogue. In a white paper published last year, Cisco predicted that “It would take an individual over 5 million years to watch the amount of video that will cross global IP networks each month in 2019.”
“Globally,” the report says, “consumer internet video traffic will be 80 percent of all consumer Internet traffic in 2019, up from 64 percent in 2014.” One of the issues that web video poses is that it requires substantially more bandwidth than text or photos. The cost of streaming video for both providers and consumers is considerable. Video is generally what eats at your smartphone’s data plan, and has become a nuisance to the point that T-Mobile offered to not include Netflix and Hulu traffic when calculating data usage.
Rendering video — processing footage and post-production effects into a singular format — is similarly cumbersome on a technical level, and almost always happens on a user’s computer, not on a platform’s servers. Consequently, a video file with a number of elements, such as text overlays, graphics, and audio, is compressed into a single, uneditable file before it even leaves the computer. This gives users relatively high amounts of aesthetic control compared to a medium like text, where Facebook and Twitter don’t even let users bold or italicize passages.
The Myspace-ification of web video is most obvious on livestreaming services like Twitch, which has turned into a cacophony of visual elements as a result of the ad-hoc economy that surrounds it. That economy features escalating calls to action encouraging viewers to follow, subscribe, and donate. Subscribing for $4.99 a month gets viewers special perks, like custom emoticons to use in a stream’s chat room, while donating is like throwing money into a tip jar — you can do it as often as you’d like.
All of this begs the question: having already disrupted an enormous state-sponsored eavesdropping conspiracy, has Snowden set his sights on EGOTing? He came close to an Academy Award last year when Citizenfour, the documentary about him, won an Oscar.
Branching out into music is a smart move for Snowden. Most members of the EGOT club are composers and musicians that provide music for film and television as well. The Tony race is probably the toughest for Snowden to enter, given its geographic specificity, but he could probably write the book for an award-winning production.
For now, however, Snowden’s trophy case remains empty.
Edward Snowden is famous for two things: leaking thousands of documents revealing a vast, secretive government-surveillance apparatus threatening the civil liberties of every American, and sick beats.
That’s why this morning’s news that Snowden has collaborated with electronic-music genius Jean Michel Jarre is so exciting. The world has been waiting for Snowden’s single to drop and, finally, that single is dropping. The track, “Exit,” will be released this weekend, the Guardian reports, though it’s already on Spotify now. Snowden appears around the 3:28 mark talking about the importance of protecting our right to privacy. The track is, in the words of this tech writer, poppin’.
Describing his upcoming album, Electronica 2: The Heart of Noise, Jarre got real deep:
Wow. Profound stuff. Really makes you think …
Jarre was put in touch with Snowden after giving an interview to the Guardian last year. Snowden, an avid fan of electronic music, agreed to collaborate on the track, where he can be heard speaking but, unfortunately, not singing.
“I sent him a demo of the music, then had a meeting with Edward over Skype, 90 minutes of conversation, where I gave him the understanding of what I wanted to do, we talked about his situation, the reason why he did what he did, then we recorded his vocals,” Jarre said.
An international group calling itself Evacuation Squad has claimed credit for calling in bomb threats that closed dozens of schools worldwide this month. The latest threats came Monday, when six schools in Sydney, Australia, were forced to close, and a representative for the group told Mashable there are more to come.
Evacuation Squad member “Viktor Olyavich” gave Mashable more details than you’d expect from a member of an international criminal prank group, claiming that his squad is made up of six people and mainly uses servers in Russia and Iran. They’ve been operating through a stolen voice-over IP account that had a surplus of prepaid credit, making them difficult to trace.
“We do these threats because they are funny to us,” he said.
“Olyavich” boasted that his team will close any school, business, or sports venue by request, but he said they plan to start charging for their services (paid in Bitcoin, of course) on March 1.
“We are preparing to do schools across Europe as we speak,” he said.
Mashable reported that no authority, including Sydney’s police department, has officially confirmed Evacuation Squad’s involvement in the school closures. However, police did confirm the threats came in over the phone via an electronic message.
Twitter has also suspended two of Evacuation Squad’s accounts, @Ev4cuati0nSquad and @SwatTheW0rld, from which they claimed credit for the bomb threats.
At the Supreme Court yesterday, justices once again considered Fisher v. University of Texas, in which plaintiff Abigail Fisher argued that she had been denied a spot at the university because of its affirmative-action policy. Fisher’s case has been roundly criticized for playing a bit fast and loose with UT minority admissions statistics (in reality, many white students with lower grades than Fisher’s were admitted, many minorities with higher grades were excluded), but nonetheless, the court is hearing her out.
As if Fisher hadn’t fomented enough animosity against her, it was compounded yesterday by Justice Antonin Scalia’s remarks that “most of the black scientists in this country don’t come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they’re — that they’re being pushed ahead in — in classes that are too — too fast for them.”
And so current and former black students — who this year make up just 4 percent of UT’s freshman population — struck back on social media, posting photos of themselves in cap and gown as a sort of middle finger, with the message #StayMadAbby.

And actually everything. Darius Kazemi, probably the best-known maker of Twitter bots, repurposed one of his accounts to automatically mock the Jeb tweet:
When you’ve been badly burned by Newsweek, you know things have gotten desperate. And Jeb may not have considered another aspect of the “optics” of tweeting a gun with his name engraved on it and the word “America.” It may have been intended as strong support for the Second Amendment, but to some, it looked more like a cry for help:
It’s been another rough day for Jeb! Bush. First, someone bought his domain name, JebBush.com, and redirected it to the website of his blustering rival, Donald J. Trump. Then, in what armchair psychologists might see as an attempt to reclaim his manhood, Jeb tweeted a photo of a gun with his name on it. He captioned it “America.”
Jeb, it’s going to be okay. You don’t have to be president if you don’t want to.
Oh, Jeb. Poor, sweet Jeb. Here are some other things which are America, according to Twitter:

In Sales’s book, no one talks about having found friends anywhere on social media (girls do mention meeting boys through Tinder, though this fact is always shared to further the narrative that social media sexualizes teen girls). Apps are mostly an extension of the high-school social circle, a lesser way to communicate with people you already know, a medium that encourages sexualization, vamping, bullying, random hookups, and general bad behavior.
At this point I should admit my bias: I met most of my friends online — most because we read something the other had written and we got in touch — and a good percentage of my relationships are conducted almost exclusively over text, Gchat, Instagram comments, WhatsApp voice messages. And when I’m not yakking online, I’m watching other girls yak at each other. I love teen girls; I read a lot of blogs run by teen girls, and I know that social media is good for more than what Sales has reduced it to.
I felt a little crazy after reading this book — girl after girl telling stories about how stressful and demeaning social media was, while online I was reading post after post by teens making jokes, praising their online friends, finding a niche on the internet. Were these girls fronting? Was it really all bad? I reached out to a teen I’d met reporting another story and asked if she’d be up to chatting with me about social media. We talked on the phone for two hours.
Alicé is 17 and met her best friend on Twitter. She started tweeting in earnest two years ago. “I was lonely before Twitter,” she says. “Without Twitter, I would still be depressed. No one has ever tried to be my friend. I’m different. I can’t relate, and people at school think I’m stuck up for saying that.” She grew up outside of New York, moved to rural Pennsylvania in ninth grade, and never quite fit in.
She had a boyfriend but it wasn’t going great; she went on Twitter to talk to people. “I saw this random post of this girl I didn’t know so I retweeted it, and then I was like, maybe I should post a selfie, and then she retweeted it, and she had 7,000 followers, and some people followed me. I was like, oh, is this how it works? And then I started making some friends on Twitter.”
Eventually Alicé broke up with her boyfriend, because “talking on Twitter was more fun than sitting on the couch in silence.”
I ask her if she ever regrets the amount of time she spends on her phone.
“I don’t regret it, I love it,” she says. She admits there was a time when she was too focused on social media. “I got too obsessed with it,” she says. “I loved talking to the people I met online way more than the people I met in school. I guess that kind of depressed me without realizing it. You need human connection, and human social interaction. I guess I was really sad.” She connected with a girl online who was going through the same things, and that really helped. She made more of an effort to connect with people at school.
Alicé has had in-person meetings with nearly 20 of her Twitter friends, mostly on trips to New York, though she met one U.K.-based friend when she was in Italy with her family last summer. “I would have never met the people I’m friends with without the internet,” she says. “I have a lot of friends who live outside of the U.S. or in the middle of nowhere, and those people I’ll meet probably when I’m older.”
She is in a few group chats with various friends she has met online, but prefers one-on-one communications. She says there are seven people she’s in near-daily contact with, three girl friends she FaceTimes with every day.
One of the sweetest and most powerful moments in Nancy Jo Sales’s new book American Girls: Social Media and the Secret Lives of American Teenagers comes during an interview with a trans girl named Montana, who tells Sales that YouTube saved her life: “Transgender kids on YouTube saved my life; just knowing they were there, hearing them talk and seeing them be strong.”
“We’re all coming from the same place,” she says. “We’re going through the exact same things, living miles and miles apart. We follow people we relate to, so we’re already connected before we’re even speaking to each other.”
“I’ve had the deepest conversations with people I’ve met on the internet,” she says. “ I’ve never had such support from people; I treasure them. I was dumbfounded at how much they actually cared.”
The social-media culture that Sales describes is still a part of Alicé’s life, but because she has her Twitter friends, it stings less. “When I was younger, people did cyberbullying, but we’re older now, you grow up and realize, why do I care so much, and you realize you don’t, and you stop,” she says.
I ask Alicé if she’s dated anyone she met on Twitter. “I was in a real-life relationship with this one girl I met on Twitter, but it didn’t work out,” she says. “And I’ve hooked up with a few people through Twitter. It’s almost like a dating app. I’ve flirted with all of my friends.”
Alicé is bisexual. I ask how she figured it out, or if she’s always known.
“I think Twitter helped me. I’d never thought about it before,” she said. “I guess I’d see girls and just think, oh she’s so beautiful. Then I was like, oh, I’m not just thinking they’re beautiful, it’s more than that. I want to have relationships with them! Then a few of my friends [from being online] who were girls would flirt with me, and I’d be like, I’m really attracted to this person. So I was like, okay I guess I’m bisexual.”
Alicé’s Instagram and Twitter feature a lot of pics of her in underwear. She’s 17 and has a great body and she’s beautiful. Sales argues that pressures from boys and other girls on social media make girls feel like they have to post these shots. She is careful to say that she doesn’t view girls as victims, but she does imply that she thinks they feel pressure to objectify themselves. I ask Alicé about her pics.
“All of these body-positive pics were being posted and I wanted to join in because I’m body-positive,” she says. “It started this summer. I felt too little when I was 15 or 16, but this summer I was older. I’m almost 18. I love those types of pictures. It doesn’t need to be sexualized, this would be like if you saw me at a pool. I’m confident with my body and I don’t see a problem with that. I see Tweets sometimes that say something like, ‘I wouldn’t date someone who posted a pic in their underwear,’ and I’m like, if you don’t like me, don’t follow me. I’m not ashamed.”
I ask if her mom knew about the pictures.
“At first my mom said, why do you want to show your body to people? [The answer is:] Because I like it. Now my mom is like, I see the underwear pics on Instagram, but it’s your body, you can do what you want. Once she said, there’s pedophiles, you know, and I’m like, I don’t care. I’m safe. I don’t tell people where I live or anything.” I ask about the people she knew in real life, if they ever said anything to her about the pics. She says no, but she knows guys who don’t even talk to her have them saved on their phones. I ask her how that made her feel — she says she didn’t care.
Later in the book we meet an IRL friend of Montana’s, a mentor of sorts: Robert, a gay man in his 50s she met at theater camp. They talk about feminism and Caitlyn Jenner while Robert does Montana’s makeup (at one point Robert says, “This girl is too much. Sitting in my makeup chair and railing against the Establishment”). It’s a really lovely scene — Robert and Montana are funny, their banter sweet — but it didn’t happen in a vacuum. Where did she learn about feminism — school? the internet? YouTube? Twitter? Tumblr? We learn the name of Montana’s favorite YouTuber (I Am Jazz), and that Montana loves her for her “honesty and realness.” But how did she find Jazz’s videos? Who else did she follow? How often was she watching these videos? Did she leave comments? Make her own videos? Had she met trans girls online?
Two weeks from now she turns 18. She is going to take the bus three hours to New York and meet up with a bunch of her friends. She met them on Twitter.
After we got off the phone, I texted her one last follow-up question. I knew the answer, but wanted to confirm:
“Are you a feminist?”
“Yeah, I’m definitely a feminist. Women need equal rights.”
“Where did you learn about feminism?”“Twitter and the internet.”
I don’t know why the good side of social media isn’t in Sales’s book. (I’d hoped to ask her, but her publicist said her schedule was full.) But its epilogue confirmed to me that Sales doesn’t really understand the nuance. She is reminiscing about her first high-school boyfriend, describes them together as teens, walking home after school, doing homework together, talking for hours. She concludes the book:
Red marker, x’s, huge red circle, no, no, check your work. True and lasting connection can and does come from social media — it is born there and it is nourished there. That second world isn’t a ghetto — it’s not even a second world. It’s an expansion of this one.
“YouTube saved my life” is a powerful statement, and I wish Sales had explored it more. I think half her book could have been devoted to YouTube or Twitter or Tumblr saving kids’ lives, literally or hyperbolically. That is the social-media experience many American girls are having online. If you’re looking for an answer to the question “What the heck is my daughter doing on her phone all the time?” you might find the answer in this book. But many parents will come away from this book with no better understanding of their daughters or the role social media plays in their lives. These girls have found feminist education and empowerment, and they’ve found it on the internet.
For this book, Sales talked to 200 girls in ten states. The picture she paints is bleak: For the girls depicted, social media is the means by which they’re bullied and objectified — and by which they objectify themselves. The book details the dark side of social media, the side that compels girls to belittle each other in Instagram comments, pressures them to send boys nudes, devastates them when they comply and the pics end up on “slut pages.”
The chapters in American Girls are given titles based on the ages of the girls she spoke to: 13 to 19. Each is made up of several scenes of teen girls talking to Sales and to each other about social media; Sales expands on these anecdotes with explorations of larger cultural trends, incorporating quantitative data, interviews and quotes from academics and bloggers.
Despite the promise of exploring the lives of American girls online, her main theme is the sexualization of the girls — the ways, Sales argues, that social media exacerbates that sexualization. Girls explain how to take the best selfies; they talk about the school hotness rankings; they obsess over how to interact with boys, whose behavior is repeatedly attributed to the ubiquity of online porn; they make and watch YouTube beauty videos, constantly preening on both sides of the camera.
The narrative accelerates as the ages of the girls climb. In “17,” Sales explores (and deplores) hookup culture; by “18,” she is talking to a few girls who have opted out of the social-media wasteland (one because she is a runaway living on the streets of Tucson); at “19,” we see the wreck that social media has made of heterosexual romantic relationships: A couple talks about online stalking and subtweeting (which Sales defines incorrectly as posting comments the other cannot see); a guy discloses that he has no need to be in a relationship, then explains how easy it is to clean up on Tinder. It’s eventually revealed what all the sexting and nudes and slut pages lead to in the most horrific admission of the book: A guy at a party in Indiana boasts to Sales that inviting his friends to rape a drunk girl who has “agreed” to have sex with him is fair game if she’s a slut. (When Sales asks him if he watches online porn and he admits that he started at 13 and watches twice a day, the implication is unsaid but clear: All of the porn-influenced bad behavior that boys have exhibited over the course of the book can culminate in rape.)
This is all unquestionably horrible. I came away from the book even more happy not to be a teen right now than I normally am. I am very thankful that Sales traveled across the country to speak to teen girls and take them seriously. But I don’t agree that social media is ruining girls’ lives, and I think that Sales’s focus on demonstrating its ill effects prevented her from asking questions and talking to people that would have brought her to a more holistic understanding of the social web.
Lorem ipsum is the Latin placeholder text designers use to mock up a layout before the actual copy goes in. DJ Khaled is the portly, jovial, and, above all, inspirational hip-hop producer who holds the major keys to success in life and whose sole activity in life is winning. Khaled ipsum is what happens when you put those two together, and it’s what you use if you want your designs to be the best forever.
It looks a little something like this:
Lion! Let’s see what Chef Dee got that they don’t want us to eat. Give thanks to the most high. Lion! Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. They will try to close the door on you, just open it. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key.
They don’t want you to win. They don’t want you to present several paragraphs of inspirational DJ Khaled quotes to your clients. But guess what? To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history. Simple, you’ve got to make it.
Khaled ipsum was created by designer Patrick Wong, who works for Lyft. And since he launched it, he’s already been winning more.

Thanks to the work of net artists like Darius Kazemi, Twitter bots were better and funnier than ever this year, their hungry algorithms ingesting raw material and spitting out gold. One recent example: Mike Watson’s metalband.exe, which generates fake metal-band names that are practically indistinguishable from the real thing.
Metalband.exe takes the nouns from actual metal bands and recombines them into equally ridiculous fake ones. Venom Lord? Brutal. B+. Flesh Grave? A++++. Moon of Gore? Yes. (Would also make an excellent title for a trashy B-movie.) To say nothing of Ghost Murder and Satan of the Disease. The cheesy stylized fonts are just icing on the cake (the Cakethrone of Sacrifice?)
It’s as if the Linux kernel had a baby with Adult Swim’s paean to/parody of metal Metalocalypse, and they named that cursed child Cannibalwolf. In 2015, computer programs are more metal than humans, just as the Terminator films foresaw. \m/.
“Ahhhh this is my favorite scene,” Dallas tweeted at 4:54 p.m. ET, 36 minutes before the movie finished. He hasn’t tweeted since. Grier spent most of the “watch along” period encouraging fans in different countries to push the film to No. 1.
The Outfield is available on iTunes, where it has a five-star rating after nearly 16,000 reviews. “IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS TO COME OUT , I CRIED JUST WATCHING THE TRAILER . SO PROUD OF CAM AND NASH ON HOW FAR THEY HAVE COME . KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK BOYS, LOVE U MORE THAN ANYONE,” reads one review.
On Tuesday, the world of Teens Online was wracked with feverish anticipation over a movie most adults were at best dimly aware of: The Outfield.
The Outfield, as the cultured among you no doubt already know, is the movie debut of Nash Grier and Cameron Dallas. Grier and Dallas are most famous for being hugely popular on the video-loop social network Vine, where they trade in affable good looks and slightly mean jokes; Christopher Glazek’s description of Grier from earlier this year is a good introduction:
Both Grier and Dallas are marquee names on a sort of Vine-star traveling circus called MagCon, a popular event at which the various (teenage male) stars of Vine attempt to work their talent for charming 15-second mugging into an hour-long stage show, to varying degrees of success. The Outfield marks Grier and Dallas’s most high-profile collaboration yet. I’d describe it as their bid for mainstream movie success, but really it’s just a bid for a more direct revenue stream: It stars no other recognizable Hollywood actors and is being released directly to iTunes, where Dallas and Grier are now trying to get it to the No. 1 spot with the self-explanatory hashtag campaign #TheOutfieldToNumberOne.
But, ahh, why buy the cow (the Vine stars’ movie) when you can get the milk (Vine stars livetweeting themselves watching their movie) for free? “Ahah I just started it,” Dallas tweeted at 4:03 p.m. (as of publication, 5,445 retweets and 12,900 likes), opening up a brief “Twitter watch along” window. Parsimonious Vine-star fans could now watch the movie through the tweets of their idols, without spending a penny. It was … not particularly elucidating.
Is that a naked woman I spy … ?
Finally, a realistic depiction of sex.
Today, free porn-streaming site Pornhub launched its virtual-reality section (a partnership/publicity stunt undertaken with “VR porn store BaDoink”). So, if what you were looking for is “porn you can only watch with a headset, for free”: It’s here now!
If you have an Oculus headset, you can use that; otherwise, you can use those cardboard headsets that phones slide into.
From Gizmodo, which was very thorough and tested the site on “iOS and Android setups and a couple different headsets”:
But what is it really like? If you’re too afraid to visit Pornhub on your computer, here are some sexy screenshots from the website. (Note that these are optimized for Oculus headsets, so if you have boring human eyes it may be difficult to make out the action.)
The Federal Communications Commission will propose a new subsidy for home internet costs today, looking to close a growing technological gap between households with and without internet access.
The proposed subsidy — $9.25 per month for broadband — will, hopefully, allow low-income households to gain web access at home, and is part of an overhaul of the existing Lifeline phone-subsidy program, which was crafted in 1985. According to FCC chairman Tom Wheeler, only 48 percent of households earning less than $25,000 a year can afford broadband service from their local provider.
Michael O’Rielly, a Republican FCC commissioner, has criticized the plan. “Such irresponsible action will balloon a program plagued by waste, fraud and abuse, and result in higher phone bills for every American — including those already struggling in the current economy,” he wrote last week.
Still, many are coming to see the internet as a utility, not a luxury. According to Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic FCC commissioner, 70 percent of teachers require students to go online for homework, assuming web access to be a foregone conclusion. Many Americans without internet access at home rely on public libraries for their access. In 2013, 77 percent of those surveyed in a Pew Research Center poll classified free access to computers and the internet as a “very important” service that libraries offer. Last year, the commission adopted new rules to preserve net neutrality.
The best thing about leaving translation up to machine-learning robots is that they’re not particularly interested in context. If, say, lots of Ukrainians are referring to Russia as a lava-filled hellscape, who are Google’s robots to dispute it?
Google Translate introduced a number of errors into its Ukrainian-to-Russian process recently: According to the BBC, “Russian Federation” translated to “Mordor,” the fictional lava-filled hellscape from Lord of the Rings.
Other issues including changing “Russians” to “occupiers,” and translating the last name of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov as “sad little horse.” Users began sharing the mistakes (?) on VK, Russia’s version of Facebook.
The issue has now been fixed, but Google told the BBC that the errors were caused by computer error, not human. Translate’s programming looks for language patterns across large swaths of text. In this case, likely exacerbated by the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukrainian references to Russia have been none too kind.
The texts only gave me snippets of Minda’s life, but it was clear it was vastly different from mine. As a 20-something journalist who spends her free time trading cat GIFs on Gchat and drinking wine in her bathtub, community-building for me means giving apartment-building neighbors nicknames like “crazy girl” and “sir cooks-a-lot.” While Minda’s friends were texting to congratulate her on her newborn, mine were sending me updates on their latest UTIs. She was able to support her family as a freelance stylist, while the majority of my disposable salary goes to canceled ClassPass appointments. If my boyfriend made me sushi, I’d probably be suspicious he cheated on me.
Because of this, even the most mundane mass texts — including one advertising “yoshon” (kosher grain) muffins or “chalav yisroel Reesies crunch cookies” (made, I learned, with dairy products obtained under the supervision of an observant Jew) — were precious to me. And it was impossible to resist showing off the view of my window into a stranger’s life: Eventually, I tweeted a few screenshots.
Not long after my tweet, I got a text message: “Hi, you have my wifes old phone number. Im sorry if anyone bother you about our hairdressing business. or our newborn, or anything else. if anyone is looking for us and its not too much of a bother you can forward them this number. Thanks you so much!” Until that moment, I realized, I’d imagined Minda and her family as residents of a Christopher Nolan-esque fourth dimension — a parallel universe it was impossible to contact. But, of course, despite what you might have heard, Cleveland belongs firmly to our dimension and universe.
This new communication thrilled and embarrassed me. I cannot remember a time where I typed and deleted sentences so frantically. I’d thought of myself as a kind of Orthodox Hairdresser NSA, silently intercepting texts intended for someone else — instead, I was the most obvious kind of gawker. Of course they’d find out and (rightfully) think I was a creep. I introduced myself to Minda’s husband and hesitantly expressed admiration for his family. He humored me, and even revealed that he ran a private sushi-delivery business from his house on Saturdays. He was worried about losing business, so I told him I’d forward any incoming texts.
Needless to say, I informed all of my friends in the Minda loop of the breakthrough. “You have to go to Ohio!” one person declared with certainty, offering to film the encounter. “It’s too early for that,” I replied, as if it were an actual possibility. I’d read so many tales of serendipitous internet encounters that part of me wanted to establish an everlasting friendship with these Orthodox Jews from Ohio. Maybe Minda was my Brother Orange.
I adopted my forwarding responsibilities with pride. And I had plenty of work to keep up with: requests to put some Minda haircuts into an upcoming kollel auction, neighbors wondering if they could borrow a car-seat adapter, an acquaintance looking for a ride, another trying to drop in on New Years, something about a “hashgacha job,” and even the lone word “here.” They stood in stark contrast to what was on my personal phone: a mix of one-sided conversations with robots — Twitter verification codes, Uber arrival alerts, Cleanly pickup warnings, invitations to track a Seamless order — and rambling, emoji- and abbreviation-filled conversations with friends. If her text-istence was evidence of her strong ties to her community, mine was evidence of my love of Seamless. My Venmo alerts were often the only evidence I went out and did something. And even then, that something was typically represented by a single wineglass emoji.
One day I forwarded an image from a mass text advertising “fillets for Chanuka” and Minda’s husband couldn’t open it. “Can u send that to my wife?” he asked, and gave me her number. Whoa, I thought. It’s all happening. I sent it her way and then introduced myself as the person who’d inherited her number. “Yea:), I have lots of stories with that number. I heard you do too,” she said. I took this to mean that she’d read my Tweet, which made me feel creepy again. I tried forwarding a message to her the next day, and she didn’t respond. “Minda just needs space,” I told my friends when they asked for updates.
A month later my personal phone was stolen. And because I was too broke to replace it, I decided to transfer my original number to my new device. That meant giving up Minda’s number. I’ve buried a fair share of iPhones in my day, but losing Minda’s number felt like losing a community.
I’ve spent a good amount of my life stalking friends on Facebook, celebrities on Instagram, and writers on Twitter. But getting a midwestern Orthodox family’s incoming texts was a kind of voyeurism I’d never experienced. I wasn’t watching Minda — in a wholly unintentional and largely unfixable way, I had become her. The more we rely on technology to communicate, the more we copy some portion of our actual identities onto our phones and computers. Because a phone company randomly assigned me her number, I was, for a month, a new mom, a hairstylist, the wife of a sushi-delivery guy to a small community of people in Ohio.
Everyone has a person they’re waiting on a text from: an errant boyfriend, an impatient boss, an overdue Seamless order. I just spent a stretch of my life waiting on texts from several people — not friends or co-workers or food-delivery guys. No, lately I’ve been waiting on texts from a bunch of Jewish guys near Cleveland asking me to cut their hair.
It was captivating, and more than a little disturbing. What would I think if someone else suddenly started inheriting my texts? Or, maybe worse, what would they think of me? Minda has supportive friends and strong community ties; her life is one to aspire to. But I’m not sure I’d like what a stranger would think if she became me for a month. Among other things, experience made a very strong case for enabling the longest possible lock-screen passcode on my own smartphone
And yet, I still hope that whoever gets to be Minda next appreciates it as much as I did. And that Rabbi Munk gets his hair cut.
This all started when I got a new phone in November. I had noticed that my personal and work lives were overlapping too often on my personal smartphone — a device I sometimes operated while incapacitated. I decided to join the shamefully privileged two-phones club: one for Snapchat, one for Outlook.
A few hours after my brand-new rose-gold iPhone was activated, I got my first text. “2 haircuts today…. ? Afternoon or evening. Like 8pm?” it read. The phone number had a Cleveland area code. As someone with about 1,200 unread emails in her inbox, I have a laissez-faire approach to inexplicable and unanswerable messages. It barely registered.
But the texts didn’t let up. “Just want to confirm haircut for rabbi munk at 3663 severn at 1:10.” “Hi this is michoel cohen. Do you have any hair appts open todaybor tomow?” “Are we on for haircut at 1:10 for rabbi munk in garage?” Poor Rabbi Munk! I began to gently tell my new contacts that they had the wrong number. But with the barrage of appointment requests I’d received, it felt more like I was the one who had the wrong number.
I was living — it soon became clear — with someone else’s phone number. We’ll call her Minda. By the second week of living with Minda’s old phone number, I was no longer bothered by the messages. They’d become new clues in the digital identity I’d inadvertently inherited. Minda’s life events were also my life events, and studying her incoming texts became a hobby. I started telling my friends about Minda, updating them on her life in the same way I might talk about a distant Facebook friend whose status updates are fascinatingly suburban. Based on what I knew, Minda lived in a tight-knit Orthodox Jewish community somewhere near Cleveland, Ohio. She cut hair for a living, while also taking care of a newborn. Her husband sometimes made sushi? Judging by the amount of texts and phone calls I received, she seemed popular. Or at least, she was connected to her community in a way that I envied.
When I received a series of messages peppered with felicitations and Yiddish, I was able to discern that she’d recently had a baby — or, as her friends called it, a “little tzaddikle.” A few people said they were “davening” (praying) for her. I found myself worrying about Minda, and feeling grateful for the support from her community.
For most people, push notifications are helpful. Someone sends you a message, or likes your post, or gives you a reminder. They work because most of us are boring and not famous and we will shuffle off this mortal coil having changed the lives of relatively few people. Almost none, in fact. Even the quote-unquote popular among us get a manageable number of notifications each day.
Celebrities are different. The fans demand content and the famous oblige them, and the fans engage with said content. They are receiving an unceasing cascade of likes and comments and messages day in and day out. Unfortunately, push notifications do not work at this scale, as Dutch soccer player Demy de Zeeuw found out this week.
“When you post epic content on instagram.com/433 8 million followers, this is how your pushnotification will look like.. ☕🐸,” he captioned it.
The account that de Zeeuw is referencing, @433, has 8 million followers and every single interaction on their account triggers a push notification. It seems bad. Being famous basically renders your phone unusable, so if you can help it, try not to get famous online.
I spoke on the phone with Heath, a manager at the Krispy Kreme location who about knew the incident I was describing. He was, however, slightly surprised that I knew of the video. “Actually, that video was supposed to have been removed from the web,” he told me, “so I’m surprised it’s still out there circulating.”
I told him that the video had millions of loops, and that I wanted to follow up on it, see what the aftermath was. At this point, Heath said that he could not tell me anything, and said he would have to direct me to Krispy Kreme’s corporate office. I called the phone number, which presented me with a list of options that did not include “viral video response.” I had no luck. I followed up with an email to Krispy Kreme’s media contacts, but have not heard back.
I couldn’t stop thinking about that video, though — the best Vine of all time. So I turned to Twitter, searching for posts that contained the words kicked and sign, as well as the URL string “vine.co” and restricted results to before the date of Fab Cheerleader’s vine.
What I found were a number of tweets, all of which reference the same now-removed Vine. Many included the hashtag #tumblingislife, and a few referenced the user @TumblingIsLife1. The man who runs that account, Aaron, is the hero of our story — the man who kicked the sign off the wall at Krispy Kreme. Aaron, who originally hails from the Bronx and now lives in Atlanta, told me that he took up tumbling at an early age. He was inspired by watching his cousin tumble, and also by Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. He now teaches tumbling to others.
I can try to tell the story of that infamous night any number of ways, but none of them can compare to how Aaron described the incident to me firsthand. It is an amazing story. In his own words:
Oh my God, let me tell you about that night. So I have a free coupon to get like a dozen doughnuts, so I go, "All right, say no more." I go make moves — we’re all in line, we’re just talking. I was like, "Yo, I’m about to make a video, I’m about to do a flip." So I give them my coupon, I’m like, "Stand in line, get the dozen doughnuts, I’m gonna go over here and make this video," and all that. So it was me and my two friends. I tell them to set up at the table. I was like, "Oh, I gotta get my intro real quick." I did my little intro — "Back at it again at Krispy Kreme" — and I was like, "Y’all ready?" Then we flipped the camera around. I back up. I told myself, I’m not gonna hit anything. So I do my flip, but the second flip that I did — the back handspring, the back one with hands going into the spin — I stretched it out too long. So when I went into the air and started spinning, my left leg hit the sign off the wall clean, and it dropped behind the counter. And it was like [glass shattering sound effect]. It was packed. There was a good hundred, a hundred and some change, people inside. Everybody was talking. As soon as that thing dropped, everybody didn’t talk for a good 30 seconds. It was nothing but silence. As soon as I landed — I didn’t fall after that, you saw me, I landed on my feet. I looked up and I saw that it fell, I didn’t look at nobody, I just kept walking, and I walked out the door. Everybody was like, "What the heck? Oh shoot, he just kicked down the sign!" Everybody started going crazy. Then I was just outside chilling. Three people from behind the desk that were making doughnuts or whatever ran outside and it was like, "Yo, that shit crazy, bro!" And he was like, "Bro, I think somebody in there’s calling the cops,” or whatever. So they called the cops on me, and I had to do a little whipping and running. They didn’t find me, and then that was it for the night.
In the aftermath, Aaron said that he did get a visit from law enforcement. “The sheriff came to my house, and we talked about it, but he was like, ‘You don’t have to pay for anything like that, just don’t do anything like that again.’”
There are many good Vines, but few perfect ones. Cats, dogs, pranks, visual trickery, six-second operas — there’s no shortage of great work on the video platform that created the Loop, a new type of video format. Vine was founded in January 2013, and its first year, like any growing platform, came in fits and starts. But I never really understood the mesmerizing nature of the loop until I saw "Back at It Again at Krispy Kreme," the best Vine of all time.
And that was it. Afterwards, Aaron deleted the video from his account in order to avoid attention from law enforcement, but it still lives online. And thank God it does, because it is the best Vine of all time. The phrase “Back at it again at Krispy Kreme” is still referenced on a daily basis. That famous sentence is now a mantra — every time you inject a little bit of extraordinary flair into the mundane, you, too, are back at it again … at Krispy Kreme.
Asked if he had any other thoughts to add, Aaron stated, as a matter of fact, “Tumbling is life.”
Two years ago, on January 13, 2014, the Vine account Fab Cheerleader posted a video captioned “He hit the sign😂,” and it is incredible. In the first shot, a man holds a Krispy Kreme hat up to the camera and says that famous line, “Back at it again at Krispy Kreme.” In the second shot, he does a back handspring into a neon Krispy Kreme sign, knocking it from its housing. Roughly a quarter-second afterward — before the sound of the sign being wrenched from the wall has even finished — the video begins again. It is a masterpiece.
I love many things about this Vine. First of all, the punch line is insane. “Back at it again at Krispy Kreme,” we hear. What does it mean? I can all but guarantee that nobody assumed the phrase meant “back handspring into a neon sign.” I love how it ends before the sign hits the floor. We get just enough to know that the handspring — impressive in and of itself — has caused some damage. But we don’t know the extent of the damage, nor how our stuntman reacted, or how the employees of Krispy Kreme reacted. It’s a blank space that our imagination fills — made all the more dramatic by the eternal, endless loop of Vine.
So much of what made Back at It Again at Krispy Kreme fantastic — besides the guy crashing into the sign — can be attributed to the odd formal characteristics of Vine, chief among them the lack of context. Vines create an odd tension in the viewer: Each video is a mere six seconds, but it loops on endlessly. You develop an intimate knowledge of the six seconds you’re given through the peephole of the Vine — but are left totally in the dark about the context and resolution. Theories and speculation abound. The viral Vine economy, where Vines are copied and reuploaded with no credit or explantion, only heightens the mystery. Vine purists, if such a thing exists, might insist that such mystique is essential to a Vine. But as much as I could admire the delicate artistry of the unresolved disaster in "Back at It Again at Krispy Kreme," I still needed to know: What the hell happened after he kicked the sign down? So, on its two-year anniversary, I set out to find the origins of this incredible Vine — as well as learn its aftermath.
Of course, as is often the case with Vines, it wasn’t going to be easy. While “Fab Cheerleader” was the account on which the Vine went viral, it didn’t create this video — it’s just a page filled with freebooted (that is, ripped and reuploaded without credit) clips of cheerleading and tumbling. On a site called FunnyVineVideos.com, I was able to find a better-quality version of the original Vine — one that had been posted a week before Fab Cheerleader’s. But, like Fab Cheerleader, FunnyVineVideos didn’t credit the original author of the video.
I decided to take a different tactic. I called up the scene of the crime: Krispy Kreme. In the first shot, one can clearly make out a building number for the Krispy Kreme location: 9301. A quick Google query will direct you to a Krispy Kreme location in Matthews, North Carolina. (Credit where credit is due: This deduction is not my own. I vaguely recall seeing someone having done this on Tumblr months ago.)
There’s a whole demographic with a lot to say and no mainstream publication to listen or take them seriously. If Playboy plays this right, it could be that publication. If they play it wrong, though, they’re just Steve Buscemi in 30 Rock. How do you do, fellow kids?
Best of luck to our legacy pornographic media!
As the rise of free internet porn meets the movement of advertising money from print to online, Playboy’s prospects look pretty grim. What does it offer, goes the conventional wisdom, that I can’t get online? Well, if you can’t beat online, you just have to become it: The first cover model of Playboy’s new, non-nude era is an Instagram model posing for a simulated Snapchat selfie.
It seems crazy and maybe a little desperate that Playboy’s answer to “What can we offer that they can’t get online?” is “photos of Instagram models.” But, to paraphrase a famously bad tactician, you go to war with the market conditions you have, not the market conditions you want.
And the market conditions for Playboy are these: First, the prevalence of nude images and pornography of every stripe, on demand, for free, renders the ability to show a nipple — even a famous nipple — basically irrelevant. And second, building your brand on nudes is actually a liability when you want to reach an audience on Facebook and Instagram, platforms where the nipple is infamously not free.
So the new, shareable, millennial-friendly Playboy leads with Instagram starlet Sarah Rose McDaniel — you may know her as @krotchy — posing with her arm out, as if taking a selfie. Although she’s clothed, the image is in some ways more risqué than the uncensored Playboy of the past. It’s more intimate, which is by design — "the idea was to look at me from a boyfriend’s perspective,” McDaniel said — and every photo in the issue is unretouched. The overall message seems to be: The Playboy of the past was fake, like internet pornography is fake. This Playboy is real. Or at least as real as the meticulously curated lives your favorite models share on Instagram.
But this is a bit of a trick: The camera McDaniel is looking into isn’t the one she’s ostensibly holding. It’s operated by Theo Wenner. Two things Playboy can provide that Instagram can’t: high-level professional photographers and styling.
Even that is changing, though: Instagram celebrities with huge followings are increasingly able to land product endorsements and book shoots with top talent. Why would they want to pose for Playboy? There’s the audience, and the reach, yes, but as the Awl’s John Herrman pointed out recently, celebrities have little incentive to grant access to magazines who have fewer Twitter followers than they do.
Which leaves us with the one part of Playboy everyone jokes about: the articles. Thus far, journalists’ attempts to parse the phenomenon of popular women on Instagram have been a disaster. (See, e.g., the New York Post’s profile of 20-year-old insta-celeb Eileen Kelly, titled “I fuel fantasies of men who want sex with young girls, and I’m fine with it.” It’s a scorching-hot trashfire that made no attempt to understand Kelly or her audience.)
“They asked whether I was the one who had driven all the way up north. I told them, ‘Yes,’ and then they all laughed and wanted to pose for a photo with me.”
Like his first blunder, this one was also easily avoidable by reading road signs and considering context, instead of just following the GPS.
“He forgot to make the turn by the exit. He must have been looking at the landscape and been absent minded. This is very well marked and shouldn’t escape anyone,” one of the Blue Lagoon staff members said, according to Vísir.
Santillan did eventually make it to the Blue Lagoon, and spent the next day of his vacation enjoying his newfound celebrity and talking to the media. Apparently he was quite impressed with the country’s hospitality.
A bumbling American tourist from New Jersey has become famous in Iceland as the guy who keeps getting lost by blindly following his GPS. Last week, he drove five hours out of his way because of a one-letter spelling mistake — which was enough to make news around the country — and he cemented his reputation this week by accidentally stumbling into a meeting at an office building, again letting the GPS lead him astray.
According to Iceland Review Online, 28-year-old Noel Santillan arrived February 1 at Iceland’s main international airport. His hotel, in Laugavegur, Reykjavik, should have been about a half-hour trip from there. Unfortunately, some of the hotel websites listed the address as Laugarvegur — note the extra “r” — which is much farther north.
To a native (or someone with the common sense to wonder why his GPS is pointing him far, far, out of town), the mistake would have been obvious. But not to Santillan. The Iceland Review reported he drove five hours along icy roads through mountain passes before stopping to ask for directions.
The helpful local he talked to recognized the problem immediately, and helped him get a room at a nearby hotel. The silly mistake got some local news coverage, and that could have been the end of it. But even after all that, Santillan still had ultimate faith in his GPS.
On his way to Iceland’s famous Blue Lagoon spa a week later, he followed the GPS directions to an office building and wandered into the middle of a meeting.
“To my astonishment, there were the staff members of the Blue Lagoon,” the confused tourist told the newspaper Vísir.
“When I knocked on the door, they looked at me in surprise: What does this man want? I told them I was on my way to the Blue Lagoon.”
But the staff members were very understanding, because Santillan’s reputation preceded him.
Yesterday, Hunter Moore, the founder of notorious revenge-porn website Is Anyone Up was sentenced to two years in federal prison. Is Anyone Up featured nude photos used without their subjects’ consent and were often accompanied with personally identifiable information such as names and addresses.
Many of the site’s photos were submitted by vengeful ex’s looking to embarrass their former partners, but last February, Moore also pleaded guilty to “unauthorized access to a computer, aiding and abetting unauthorized access of a computer, and identity theft.” He used that access to steal nude photos to post on his site.
Moore’s website, and the numerous copycats that it spawned, has spurred legislatures to take action. Before three years ago, according to the Huffington Post, “only three states in the U.S. criminalized the unauthorized distribution of private sexual images.” That number now stands at 26.
Ironically, the sentencing documents pertaining to Moore’s case were sealed, in order to protect his privacy.
One of the few truly good and long-lasting memes in recent memory is Crying Jordan, a picture of Michael Jordan looking moist and gross. That image will soon overtake Jordan’s basketball abilities as his most enduring legacy.
We know that photographer Stephan Savoia is a fan of the meme. After being contacted by The Wall Street Journal about his photo, he told them, “I just did some Google searches after I read your email and have not been able to stop laughing.”
But what about the notoriously image-conscious Jordan himself? It turns out that he’s also okay with it. A rep told TMZ, “Everyone seems to be having fun with the meme,” which is an accurate assessment.
There is one caveat, however. “We haven’t seen anyone using it to promote their commercial interests, which is something that we’re monitoring.” So you can use Crying MJ to rake in likes and faves, but not cold, hard cash. Mr. Jordan, if you are still looking for a meme cop to monitor Crying Jordan images for possible misuse, please email me.
On the digital-art website NewHive, Shia LaBeouf is continuing his adventures into “art” by streaming a live video of himself watching all of the movies he’s been in, consecutively, for three days straight, 24 hours a day. In the live-stream, hosted at Angelika Film Center in New York, the camera is pointed straight at his face, which changes color slightly as the movies progress. Sometimes, he eats popcorn or sips his soda. Those are the exciting moments.
LeBeouf seems bright and focused now (at the time of publication, he was watching 2015’s Man Down), but over the course of several days of being exposed to his own worst (and best) work, he’s bound to look a little worse for wear. The durational performance, created in collaboration with Nastja Säde Rönkkö and Luke Turner, with whom LaBeouf formed a collective, has something in common with the work of artists like Marina Abramovic or Tehching Hsieh, though a Hollywood-lite version. It’s easy to imagine James Franco and Tilda Swinton competing over the idea.
More than a little narcissistic, extremely bizarre, straight-to-the-public, and made for the internet, the performance is pure Shia, the same person who brought you apology-as-performance-art. Watching the stream is oddly soothing, but that’s probably because we don’t actually have to see the movies. Maybe he should add some Twitch comments?
This morning, NCIS actress Pauley Perrette awoke to terrible news. She had crossed the threshold into 666,000 followers.
Please, find it in your heart to follow Pauley and get her over the 666. The Number of the Beast holds considerable personal significance for Perrette: Years ago, she saw something truly terrifying.
(***WARNING***: THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE. ONLY SCROLL FURTHER IF YOU POSSESS A STRONG HEART AND AN IRON WILL.)
Perrette’s followers managed to calm her down. She is “not going to worry about my 666 but I will always worry about that child.”
Perrette’s tweets inspired others to share their run-ins with terrifying visages.
A Boston-area college student is waiting to see if he’ll be expelled after he was caught renting his dorm room out on Airbnb, an apparent violation of his school’s campus-housing contract.
Airbnb took down Jack Worth’s rental listing after Emerson College administrators found out about it, and Worth had to pay a $150 fine to the site. He told Boston.com he was just trying to cover some of his college costs while providing cheap housing in expensive downtown Boston.
“There’s a high level of interest of travel in this neighborhood because it’s so centrally located. I saw this as a way to make some money, but also help some people out,” he said.
A Change.org petition to “Free Jack Worth” — in other words, drop the disciplinary proceedings against him and allow him to stay at Emerson — had around 450 signatures as of Wednesday evening.
“The school is levying several charges of misconduct against him, which could result in disciplinary action as extreme as his dismissal,” the petition claims. “The charges will be formally brought in an upcoming student conduct hearing.”
The petitioners view what Worth did as “an honest, entrepreneurial endeavor,” they wrote. But Emerson sees it differently.
“The Emerson College Residence hall policy and the housing contract that undergraduate residents sign prohibit students from subleasing or renting College housing units or beds to protect the residents and the community from exposure to safety and security risks,” the school said in a statement.
On one hand, there’s a reason Airbnb has cracked down on people renting out properties they don’t own — it’s an obvious security risk to have “the dumbest person in your building passing out keys to your front door.” On the other, college costs, including housing, have ballooned over the past two decades out of all proportion with income growth, inflation, and basically any other economic measure. Can you blame the guy for trying?
I was deep in a Vine hole when I first found out about PenorCut Enterprises. Here’s scene: a group of fidgety Indian boys sit on a blanket in an outdoor schoolroom facing a blackboard with the Internet-familiar phrase “ayy lmao” written on it. At the front, a boy about the same age as the other students stands with a pointer. He taps the blackboard hanging from a nail on a tree and shouts; the class shouts back at him, as if they’re learning it by rote: “Ayy lmao.”
It was undeniably fascinating, if only because I had never actually heard someone say “ayy lmao” out loud. I certainly didn’t expect to hear it for the first time from a group of kids in India. It was still a funny, weird example of globalized Internet culture … right?
The video came from PenorCut, a YouTube channel with almost 5.5 million views and 40,000 subscribers, that publishes videos made through Fiverr, a “sharing economy” site where users can offer their services for a variety of small tasks starting at $5. Many of the gigs are quick illustrations or logo designs, but there is also a very active community of pitchmen and voice actors.
The “ayy lmao” video is typical of PenorCut’s output. It’s clear that these kids don’t know what they’re saying. Maybe that means no one is getting hurt? But it’s hard not to get the sense that for lots of viewers, the joke isn’t just about the incongruity of a rural schoolroom reciting an internet meme — it’s also about the power dynamic that lets rich American web surfers tell poor Indian kids what to do.
PenorCut asks YouTube users for future video suggestions and then subcontracts them through Fiverr to Latika426, who says that the kids are students at a small classroom run by his mom out of their house. When I asked him how he felt about doing the videos his response was positive. Most of the other videos they do are birthday greetings and the like. He said that he and his mom use the money to buy schoolbooks and snacks for the kids. I’ll have to take his word on that.
Maybe this guy stumbled across an easy way to make more money for the kids his mother teaches. It’s possible that Latika has a sense of humor in tune with American 4chan users, but somehow I doubt it. Ultimately what might be most worrying about the PenorCut videos isn’t that they represent the continuation of an age-old vein of racist American humor — it’s that they show the most depressing way the “sharing economy” is putting unused assets to work. Uber lets you call a car; Airbnb lets you rent an apartment; Fiverr lets you rent Indian kids for a few seconds at a time, for just five bucks. Ayy lmao.
The men’s rights meet-ups planned around the globe this weekend were supposed to be an opportunity for men to get together and commiserate. You know, just bros bein’ bros, talkin’ ’bout booze, babes, game, “legal rape,” and the systemic oppression of men worldwide. Dozens of men had agreed to host meet-ups, but unfortunately, word got out, and now it seems that many of those meet-ups are in danger of cancellation or disruption.
After news outlets reported on the meet-ups (and their stupid code phrase), RooshV — the ringleader and prominent member of the “manosphere” — is exercising tighter caution. In Toronto, an all-female boxing club had pledged to show up, ready to fight. Others have threatened to protest the events or disrupt them in some way.
After experiencing the type of treatment that women online encounter with far greater frequency than men, Roosh has decided to step up security. “The world is moving against us,” he wrote. “I’ve gotten reports of over a dozen organized protests at our meeting points. Dozens more are being organized privately. Since this meetup was never intended as a confrontation with unattractive women and their enablers, I’m moving to save as many of these meetups as I can before Saturday.”
Prospective meet-up attendees are now required to authenticate their participation the manosphere in one of three ways: having an active commenting account on Return of Kings, an active forum account, or a screenshot of a receipt for one of Roosh’s books dated prior to January 15.
Will these terrible men be able to gather in peace? The answer is unclear.
Despite what you might think, the phrase “on fleek” — used to sell everything from Doritos to Hefty Bags — didn’t pop up online ex nihilo, waiting to be put to use by big corporations trying to look hip. It was coined by Kayla Newman in a Vine that went viral in the middle of last year. And even as brands profit from her coinage, Newman hasn’t seen a dime.
In the most recent issue of The Fader, Doreen St. Felix lays out how the current copyright system in America — ill-suited for the modern web — allows corporations to profit from, and in some cases suppress, the viral content of black teens, “members of a burgeoning Generation Z who experiment with the iPhone gaze.”
“I gave the world a word,” Newman told The Fader. “I can’t explain the feeling. At the moment I haven’t gotten any endorsements or received any payment. I feel that I should be compensated.” A corporation that coined a new phrase would have moved to trademark it immediately in order to reap the benefits. Instead, those same companies used Newman’s fleek to sell pancakes and Doritos Locos tacos.
Newman’s not the only young creative who’s found herself taken advantage of by much more powerful and resourceful businesses. In another case, 20-year-old choreographer Denzel Meechie’s popular YouTube channel often heaped attention onto the music he danced to. Artists would recruit him to dance to their songs as a way of advertising. The labels under which those artists worked, however, had a different idea: His channel was shut down after too many copyright violations.
The crux of this whole thing is that copyright law protects specific creative expressions of an idea, but not the idea itself. In an age where that specific work can be turned into a meme — quite literally “an idea, behavior, style, or usage that spreads from person to person within a culture” — creators like the black teens at the forefront of viral media have few legal safeguards, and the same platforms that give them audiences they might not otherwise have access to become instruments of much richer people who are able to profit. The entire piece is worth reading over at The Fader.
Medium wants to straddle the divide between media and tech — to be both a platform (tech) and a publisher (media). This can place it in an awkward position: Institutionally, is it on the closed-ranks side of the “new class of industrialists” of the tech industry, to whom the question of Airbnb’s liability in the deaths of its guests is already settled? Or is it an editorially independent media company with a mandate to ask uncomfortable questions? So far, its defense against the differing interests of its two halves is transparency. This morning, Matter’s editor Mark Lotto weighed in on the entire set of comments: “I can’t think of another publication or platform where an editor and his boss would have this exchange in front of everybody.”
I can, actually — I used to work at one. Would-be tech-media hybrids like Medium, and my former employers at Gawker, tend be enamored of transparency as a value, both because it promotes unfettered discourse and the free movement of information, and because it allows both partners in the uneasy marriage of tech and media to publicly distance themselves from one another.
But it’s not enough. Editorial transparency can be valuable and illuminating but, as is too often the case with tech, lofty ideals tend to blot out the actual relationships of power on the ground. Ev Williams is not just another commenter. When he publicly questions Matter’s editorial decisions, he’s thinking of Medium as a tech company and of himself as just another platform user adding his two cents. But he’s also the guy that signs the checks. His public reactions have real consequences for Medium, if only to the extent that they will shape the kinds of stories pitched to Matter. Who wants to take a risk in a space where your (rich, powerful) publisher’s distaste for your work will be made so public?
In some sense, this is a much lower-stakes version of the issue at the heart of Stone’s piece: How do we assign responsibility in a platform economy? Writing on the internet is an increasingly fraught experience. Important stories — reported investigations and personal essays alike — can leave writers vulnerable to a huge amount of public criticism (not to mention legal liability). The support of an institution is more important than you think. You don’t want to worry about your boss, or your boss’s boss, distancing himself or denying responsibility. I believe Williams when he says that he leaves calls like this up to Lotto, and I believe Lotto when he says that Williams’s response came out of respect and not reproach. But at some point Williams is going to have to settle his indigestion and figure out whether he’s a publisher, or a platform owner.
On Sunday night, the writing platform Medium’s flagship publication, Matter, published a long, heart-wrenching story about the death of writer Zak Stone’s father and the potential culpability of Airbnb. Lengthy, explicit, and decorated with photographs of Stone and his father interspersed with bitterly funny parodies of Airbnb’s website branding (horrible accidents in place of smiling travelers), the article struck a nerve; it was Medium’s “most recommended story” on both Monday and Tuesday. It also drew a comment (or a reply, or whatever Medium’s terminology is) from Medium founder Ev Williams:
As I said on Twitter at the time, :grimace emoji:. Williams has since walked back — or attempted to clarify — his note, in an explanation that’s now the second most-recommended story on Medium. (The first most-recommended is, naturally, “50 Ways Happier, Healthier, And More Successful People Live On Their Own Terms,” posted to “Life Learning.”) Williams’s post is introspective, in the methodical manner of a debugging program:
Williams had also updated his original comment to clarify that he meant the original, art-directed “images,” not the family photos, and that by “a bit much” he meant that “they nudge the tone for those who do from something critical of Airbnb but reasonable to something comically anti.”
Coincidentally, Williams’s public struggle to adequately respond to an article sharply critical of his company’s tech-industry peers came at the same time that Medium (not Matter, I don’t think? I can’t tell) was launching a “new conversation series” with a smart and thoughtful essay by Awl editor John Herrman called “Tech Is Eating Media.” Here’s Herrman on the digestion process:
Tech is eating media, and Ev Williams is burping. As Herrman writes, the two industries are increasingly inseparable from a business perspective but still divided by cultural values. Particularly where reporting and criticism are involved. Look at the reaction of tech luminaries like Dick Costolo and Marc Andreessen to the Wall Street Journal report on blood-test startup Theranos or the New York Times article about Amazon’s workplace. One industry is boosterish and positivist; the other is (supposed to be) critical and oppositional. What happens when they try to go into business together? Something like Williams’s glib and unthinking comment: general discomfort.
I guess you could call it a kind of “ideological purity test” for potential hookups.
There’s almost a year left in this election, during which people will saturate our every online interaction with their Strong Political Opinions. Even on Tinder! It’s important, but it’s also exhausting. I hope that, at the very least, someone is getting laid as part of the deal.
The internet this month feels like nothing but a great big shouting match between the Bernie Bros and the Hillary Stans, a furious, overheated debate among people who basically agree about most issues. It’s even spilled over into the world of online dating, where Tinder has started banning users who were feeling the Bern a little too enthusiastically.
Two women, who’d sent pro–Bernie Sanders messages to hundreds of men between them, told Reuters they’d had their accounts deactivated. Robyn Gedrich, 23, said she sent this campaign message to 60 men a day for two weeks: "’Do you feel the bern?’ her message to other Tinder users read, parroting a Sanders campaign slogan, ‘Please text WORK to 82623 for me. Thanks.’"
Sending that text message signs you up for Sanders’s campaign updates. Tinder shut Gedrich down on Thursday. She said that none of her matches ended in a date. Obviously.
Haley Lent, who is 22 and married, also wasn’t on Tinder seeking love and hookups. She told Reuters she contacted 50 to 100 people on the app, trying to convince people to vote for Sanders in their states’ primaries.
“If they said no or were on the fence, I would try to talk to them and persuade them to vote,” she said.
Lent, who lives in Iowa, even paid for Tinder Plus so she could change her location to New Hampshire, the site of the next Democratic primary and a crucial state for the Sanders campaign.
Tinder hasn’t commented, but it’s probably safe to assume the women’s accounts were shut down automatically after too many people reported them as spam.
Aside from Bernie Babes acting like Bernie Bots, there’s apparently been a lot of casual Tinder chat about Sanders. There’s an entire Facebook group dedicated to “Bernie Sanders’ Dank Tinder Conversations,” featuring tons of screenshots of people asking their matches whether they’ve accepted “our lord and savior, Bernie Sanders.”
Zazzle competitor Redbubble still has many Pray for Paris items on sale, including this one for people who want to show support for the French city, but also want to let people know that they like AC/DC.
Some merchandisers were in such a rush to capitalize on the deaths of more than 100 people that they forgot to spell-check.
Others barely tried to hide the fact that they were recycling Charlie Hebdo merchandise from this past January.
Other merchandisers are being more vigilant about their marketplaces. Amazon’s French arm told Vice that they were delisting products seeking to capitalize on the attacks. On Monday, eBay announced that 5 percent of revenue earned from European markets would be donated to the victims.
Update: Zazzle sent along the following statement, reiterating that items related to the Paris attack have been or are in the process of being removed.
There’s a whole category of website dedicated to user-designed, made-to-order products available to the public — think Zazzle or CafePress. They’re great for one-off custom tees or would-be clothiers with a good and simple design idea. They’re also great for people looking to make a quick buck off a tragedy, like Friday’s attacks in Paris.
A quick search for “Paris” on Zazzle reveals hundreds of product listings on the site, all of which are sold at full price and very few of which — if any — direct their profits toward charities or non-profits. They’re quick ploys to grab cash from people looking to do something, anything to show solidarity with the victims of the attacks. Many of those listings are now dead links, however. The company told Vice, “Following negative comments we received on the products conceived by the Zazzle community, we decided to withdraw the products linked to the tragedy.” They could remain in the system for another 48 hours, however. This was also the company’s second reaction; they initially allowed the sale of such items because “the drawings follow our guidelines.”
You can get Pray-for-Paris-themed shirts, sweatshirts, coffee mugs, and iPhone holders.
Some of the designs were really going for it.
The video has racked up 1.2 million views on YouTube, but Ross-Munro says he’s no hero, just a humble bloke who works down at Hinterland Mowers. It is actually impossible for this story to be more Australian.
Two Australian men, one of them shirtless, were leaving a party to look for food Friday night when they stumbled into the middle of an attempted robbery. The heroic mates were apparently sober enough to stop the getaway car and break up the crime in progress, becoming local heroes and landing an interview on Australia’s Today show. It was, quite frankly, the most Australian interview ever.
This story is so Australian, in fact, that it’s practically incomprehensible to foreigners. It had the Today hosts in fits.
Here’s what the heroic shirtless gentleman, James Ross-Munro said:
Which, translated from Straylan to American English, means the two friends were at a party where everyone was drinking short bottles of beer and wearing cutoff vests. They left to go to the service station mini-mart for food, but in a wild attempt to jump over a sign, his thong broke.
He busted his plugga. His thong broke. His. thong. broke. And he still managed to steal the keys from the getaway car and chase the robbers down the street, while his friend kept filming despite the risks of getting stabbed.
Last week, presidential candidate Donald Trump caused a minor stir by retweeting someone with the Twitter handle @whitegenocideTM, which some saw as making explicit the connection between Trump and American white supremacists. But that’s just one data point, right? A one-off thing that could have been an intern’s mistake? Unfortunately, no: the data shows that 62 percent of the accounts Trump has retweeted recently have white-supremacist connections.
Marshall Kirkpatrick, of social-media analytics company Little Bird, took a look at the 21 people the Donald has blessed with his fantastic, luxurious retweets this week, and discovered that six of them follow major white-nationalist accounts, and 13 of them follow multiple accounts that have used the #whitegenocide hashtag.
Conclusion? “It turns out that Donald Trump mostly retweets white supremacists saying nice things about him.”
It’s hard to separate cause from effect here. Is Trump riling up the white nationalists by lending them his 5-million-follower megaphone whenever they praise him? Or are racists, who love Trump for his anti-immigration polemics, just more likely than others to send our future hairpiece-in-chief the kind of praise he likes to retweet?
Either way, Trump and white nationalism seem to be caught in a positive-feedback loop, each emboldening the other.
Although being associated with @whitegenocideTM would likely hurt any other candidate, it seems Trump’s national polling numbers are bulletproof. Is that in spite of, or because of, the things the white pride crowd loves about him?
Something to think about.
Bernstein also said he’d received threats from Soulja Boy’s lawyers before the Twitter commotion ever started. Maybe Soulja Boy should have left this one to the professionals.
Soulja Boy made it as a rapper at age 16, and now he’s trying to make it as a hoverboard pitchman. But BuzzFeed reported last week that things might not be going so well for his brand (called Souljaboard, of course) because it’s been the target of widespread credit-card fraud. That was apparently information that Soulja Boy would have preferred to keep private, though — he started a feud on social media over the weekend with the writer who broke the story.
BuzzFeed reporter Joe Bernstein wrote that Soulja Boy was one of a number of hoverboard sellers who had been burned by fake sales that were later “charged back,” which left the rapper $175,000 in debt to payment-processing company Stripe. It appeared nearly 75 percent of Souljaboard purchases were fraudulent, and he’s not alone — Bernstein found two other hoverboard companies that had been hit with similar levels of fraud.
This wasn’t something the rapper wanted out in the open, and he took special issue with the publication of an email he’d sent to Stripe in an attempt to resolve the problem. Soulja Boy was pissed, and he lashed out at Bernstein on Twitter on Sunday.
Soulja Boy tweeted Bernstein’s cell phone number and the message “call me.” Hundreds of fans apparently did, thinking it was the rapper’s own number. Bernstein told Gawker he had to turn his phone off because of the deluge of calls, texts, and FaceTime requests.
The rapper also sent, and then deleted, a tweet accusing Bernstein of hacking his email. Bernstein insisted to Gawker that he obtained the email messages in his story legally, saying that if he were to hack someone, “it would probably be for a better reason than to write about hoverboard fraud.”
Although he’s stopped tweeting about it, Soulja Boy is still apparently mad about the story.
“We are working the fraud orders out with Stripe. But why is it ok for him to post this info if it’s between me and Stripe?” he asked Gawker.
Both parties agree the reporter texted the hoverboard entrepreneur for comment before the story ran, but the only reply was “How did you get this number?”
In a lawsuit filed last Friday, the handlers of web-famous-then-actual-famous feline Grumpy Cat filed a lawsuit against a California beverage company for — among other claims — copyright and trademark infringement.
Grenade Beverage was originally granted a license to produce (ugh) Grumpy Cat Grumppuccino, a bottled coffee beverage that the website Catster described as “definitely a drink.” But that was all they authorized, Grumpy Cat’s handlers say, and Grenade was not cleared to produce any other products. According to court filings, they’re now suing Grenade and its owners Nick and Paul Sandford (as well as 50 John Does) for violating the agreement.
The depressing legal filing lays out the case of Grumpy Cat Limited, which begins, “Ironically, while the world-famous feline Grumpy Cat and her valuable brand are most often invoked in a tongue-and-cheek fashion, Defendants’ despicable misconduct here has actually given Grumpy Cat and her owners something to be grumpy about.” Great start.
Grumpy Cat sure is braggy!
The crux of Grumpy Cat Limited’s argument is that it only licensed the feline for the bottled coffee beverage, and does not approve of Grenade’s move into Grumpy Cat–branded roasted coffee beans. Grenade also allegedly owns the URL drinkgrumpycat.com and is cybersquatting on grumpycat.com.
According to WHOIS results, drinkgrumpycat.com is registered to a Paul Sandford, though the organization is listed as “Grumpy Beverage LLC,” and not, as the lawsuit states, “Grenade Beverage LLC.” The WHOIS listing for grumpycat.com is anonymized, but it leads to a website identical to drinkgrumpycat.com. An email to Paul Sandford seeking comment was not returned as of press time.
Still, Grumpy Cat’s team does make at least one dubious if not outright false claim in their lawsuit. The documents state, “Plaintiff’s Grumpy Cat Trademarks have tremendous good will.” Good luck proving that in court.
Upgrading iOSes can be a minor pain, and it’s easy to ignore the dialogue boxes encouraging you to do so, especially when the biggest feature Apple is touting for its latest upgrade is Night Shift, which, uh, changes the color of your screen depending on the time of day. But Apple is also patching two major security flaws for this version, which is more than reason enough to find your USB cord and tear yourself away from the phone for the time it’ll take to upgrade.
The first is a problem with iMessage encryption. While the text you send over iMessage is as secure as it’s always been, a recently discovered security bug would allow hackers to potentially decrypt photos and videos sent over the service. (And, let’s be honest: For most of us, we’re a lot more concerned about the photos and videos we send than the text. It’s hard to take a nude ASCII selfie.)
From the Washington Post:
As bad as that sounds — in particular given the recent debate about encryption and law enforcement — the second bug is much scarier. It’s a vulnerability that allows an intruder to execute code remotely via a Wi-Fi driver, allowing an attacker to “use specially crafted wireless control message packets to corrupt kernel memory in a way that leads to remote code execution in the context of the kernel.”
In case, for some reason, that quote doesn’t make perfect sense to you, it means that if you’re connected to Wi-Fi — even private Wi-Fi, even with a VPN — you’re vulnerable to an attack that would allow a hacker connected to the same Wi-Fi network to execute code at the device’s most foundational level. Scarily, this bug has been known since at least February 1, when it was patched for Android.
Not good! Update your phone: It’s easy. From the phone, go to Settings; then General; then Software Update; and tap Download and Install. Do it now; don’t wait for tonight. Within an hour you’ll be able to get back to sending nude photos over Wi-Fi without needing to worry.
Speaking to The Guardian, an Airbnb spokesperson wouldn’t confirm or deny that the data had been manipulated through a “purge,” but did offer an alternate explanation for the discrepancy: Maybe there were just lots of extra listings in October, when tourists come in for Halloween and the New York City Marathon, and the number of listings went down in November.
“The facts are clear for all to see – the vast majority of our hosts are everyday people who have just one listing and share their space a few nights a month to help make ends meet. Airbnb is an open people-to-people platform where listings come on and go off throughout the year,” according to Airbnb’s official statement.
The facts do certainly appear to be clear — they just might not be the facts Airbnb wanted all to see.
Airbnb, one of the crown jewels of our exciting, broken new “sharing economy,” is supposed to let ordinary folks make some extra cash by renting out their spare rooms or unused homes. But according to a new report, Airbnb manipulated its data to hide the fact that a lot of renters in New York City are businesspeople with multiple properties listed on the site. That could be a big deal in Airbnb’s ongoing battle to show that it doesn’t violate the short-term housing laws in NYC, its single biggest market.
In December, Airbnb responded to criticism from City Council members by releasing a new set of numbers, which claimed that only 10 percent of New York City Airbnb hosts were listing multiple rentals. These “multi-listings” are a major reason that officials allege Airbnb users are running illegal hotels, so the company has incentive to downplay them as much as possible.
And, according to a bombshell report by Murray Cox of Inside Airbnb and sharing-economy skeptic Tom Slee, that’s exactly what Airbnb did. The numbers the company released in December were supposed to represent a typical day for Airbnb in the city — they chose to look at November 17, but Cox and Slee claim that just before that date, Airbnb purged 1,000 “entire home” listings citywide. Many of them were the controversial “multi-listings.”
The upshot is that while 19 percent of the listings were “multi-listings” for most of the year, the figure was only 10 percent on that day in November. Cox and Slee say it’s already going back up after the purge, and now sits at around 13 percent.
City officials already want to flag “entire home” listings as illegal hotels, but Airbnb’s party line is that its renters are just folks, not illegal proprietors, and the city shouldn’t be hitting them with heavy fines.
“Airbnb officials argued the data showed that renters, whom they repeatedly characterized as middle class, were simply using the service to supplement their incomes,” the New York Post reported in December, just after Airbnb had released its numbers.
So, to Cox and Slee, the motive and the evidence are unambiguous — Airbnb “Photoshopped” its data.
I’m drunk-browsing.
Have you ever clicked “like” on a post, woken up the next day, and thought, Oh no no no no no no. This is like that all in one step.
I’m looking forward to you deleting this in four hours.
You know a post is bad, but this is a lesson they need to learn for themselves.
Hacked?
For when your friend is hawking “OAKLEYS SALE 20% OFF.”
So glad you commented on this post, Mom.
For anyone who has ever been tagged in a photo and then their mom showed up in the comments with something like “Handsome!” or “Looks like a fun time!”
You’re much better-looking now than when I knew you, and I would like to reconnect.
For when you can’t resist a thirst trap.
I don’t care about you, but the dog in this photo is A++++
Look, some of us — I won’t say who — are only on Facebook to keep tabs on our friends’ dogs.
Please stop posting about Monsanto — we get it.
By now you’ve had a few hours to adjust to the five new Facebook reactions that were introduced today. You can finally say that stuff makes you angry! But there are still a lot of Facebook-related feelings that don’t have buttons yet. Hopefully these will make it into the next batch.
We all know that one friend.
This thing you’re posting is clearly very important to you and I want to acknowledge that, but at the same time I find your enthusiasm baffling.
This reaction could be more universally applicable than the “like.”
Existential despair.
This reaction is definitely more universally applicable than the “like.”
Eye-roll.
Self-explanatory. This is particularly useful in an election year.
Barf.
This is useful for when someone posts injury photos, but also for when your ex gets engaged.
In the Not Every Kick Needs to Be Started Department: Do you have trouble concentrating on your writing when there are all these stupid extra features on your computer? Do you have $500 burning a hole through your leg? Then the Freewrite (which was called, horrifyingly, the Hemingwrite during its Kickstarter) is perfect for you.
If you’ve been carting a MacBook Air to the coffee shop to work on your screenplay/novel/to-do list (item: “- write screenplay”), you know that you’re just one of dozens. Why not stand out from the crowd with a $500 keyboard? It says “I have money to spare” and “I am convinced that a gadget will solve my self-control problems.”
“The experience starts with a full-size mechanical keyboard, one built on top of wonderfully clacky Cherry MX Brown switches,” Wired gushes. “Right above it, a smartphone-size e-ink display. It’s a durable machine, with an aluminum body and an honest-to-goodness handle that flips out from under the display. You don’t need to upload to the cloud; you can also save ‘over one million pages’ of documents in plain text format to the Freewrite’s internal drive.”
Look at that thing. It’s a keyboard with an iPod Touch-size screen so you can read your Great American Novel one paragraph at a time — so useful that they included the feature to save “over one million pages.” $500. Enjoy!
Telling extended anecdotes over a series of tweets isn’t a new phenomenon, but something changed back in October when a stripper called Zola tweeted, “Okay listen up. This story long. So I met this white bitch at hooters.” “Twitter Storytime” is now a Thing, a new type of Content. There’s an entire Wired article about it. And the latest, greatest example of Twitter Storytime involves a writer, his dog, and the lady they found in the trunk of a car the other night.
Joe Craig, London-based author of the Jimmy Coates young-adult thriller series, was out for an evening stroll with his large dog, Harpo, when he detected trouble. The trunk of a nearby Renault Clio — a small, sporty French car — was shaking, and Craig could hear the screams of a woman emanating from it.
What does a thriller author do when faced with a real-life chance to be a hero? More important, what does his dog do? ‘Gather round, folks, it’s Twitter Storytime again:
Well, that was satisfying, and definitely worth a couple dozen tweets. (It’s no Zola story, but what is?)
Craig later expressed faux-regrets on Twitter about what happened, wondering aloud whether he had witnessed someone’s conception, or interrupted the conception of someone who will now never live.
You don’t have to be an actual author to tell a surprising and hilarious Twitter story, but it helps.
“We are happy to see that you guys are staying busy and having fun during Blizpocalypse,” Airbnb wrote to Horton, according to DNAinfo. “Unfortunately, your igloo, while very well constructed, has failed to meet our occupancy standards and has been removed from search results. Be sure to pick a place with running water, electricity, and a roof that doesn’t melt.”
Mere technicalities, really. There have certainly been less hospitable Airbnb properties for rent in Brooklyn.
And with the way rents are going, igloos are starting to look like an attractive alternative to some people.
Buried under one of the largest snowstorms in New York City history, some Brooklyn residents made the most of the situation by building an igloo — and, because it’s 2016, listing it for rent on Airbnb.
Patrick Horton, 28, and his friends built the “boutique winter igloo for 2” in a backyard on India Street in Greenpoint, according to DNAinfo New York. They had been planning to build an igloo after the storm hit, and decided it looked so good that they might as well list it on Airbnb as a prank.
Horton advertised their handiwork as “dripping with ingenuity and alt-lifestyle aura,” and “this snowpocalypse’s most desirable getaway.”
“Built completely by hand all natural. Come experience this chic dome-style bungalow with Bae,” he wrote. And, of course, he checked the box for the “igloo” category, which is a legitimate thing on Airbnb.
Rental price: $200 per night. An alt-lifestyle can be expensive to maintain.
The listing stayed up for a few hours, making the rounds on Reddit and Facebook, before Airbnb finally shut it down Sunday night due to building codes.
1. It provides support for the belief that women are constantly manufacturing rape allegations. This is a cornerstone of just about every online anti-feminist community: Women are constantly pretending they got raped — as revenge against lovers who jilted them, to enjoy the attention SJW “allies” will lavish on them, or for various other, equally nefarious reasons. This is a fundamental truth of the world, and the rest of us are suckers for having fallen for this whole “rape is a serious problem” nonsense. For the Gamergaters and Breitbart readers of the world, the idea of a group of feminists getting together to premeditate a fake-rape entrapment scheme is too sane not to believe.
2. It shows that, actually, it’s SJWs who are hurting women in male-dominated occupations. Another important belief of the tech-oriented subset of the anti-feminist crowd is that SJWs couldn’t care less about actual, real-life women in STEM fields. They’re really just in it for the attention, the sense of self-righteousness, and for the money that the most popular SJWs can get from speaking fees, Patreon support, or whatever else. And their greed is a shame — a damn shame! — because all their scare-mongering over sexual harassment and rape actually does is hurt the selfsame women SJWs are purporting to want to help. In reality, it’s the people who can see through feminism’s evil smoke and mirrors who really want to help women in STEM by simply letting them rise based on their own merits, rather than stymieing and confusing them with coddling, scare-mongering, or both. It’s basically “Democrats are the real racists for supporting affirmative action,” but for tech.
The second and third sentences of Raymond’s blog post, in which he immediately imparts to his readers the practical ramifications of the bombshell he’s about to drop, nails this idea in perfect-10 fashion: “The short version is: if you are any kind of open-source leader or senior figure who is male, do not be alone with any female, ever, at a technical conference. Try to avoid even being alone, ever, because there is a chance that a ‘women in tech’ advocacy group is going to try to collect your scalp.” A redditor takes things to their natural conclusion in one of the top-rated comments on KiA: “The outcome of this SJW campaign is that it’s actively hurting women in tech. If you can’t mentor them one-on-one without fearing false sexual harassment charges, then women are losing opportunities that male peers have.”
In other words: Thanks, SJWs — Eric Raymond and countless other generous men wanted to mentor women, and you made it impossible.
3. It provides yet further evidence that behind even anodyne-seeming feminist organizations lie shadowy conspiracies and evil intentions. Online anti-feminists, particularly Gamergaters, love conspiracy theories. They are the bread and butter of KiA and other like-minded communities. The standards for evidence in these communities are notoriously low, and the prevailing paranoia and resentment give rise to doozy after doozy — anyone with explicitly feminist views is likely part of something bigger and darker. This is a movement that took Anita Sarkeesian — someone whose crime was making videos expressing the opinion that video games don’t always depict women well — and turned her into a radical feminist kingpin of almost limitless power and malevolence.
In this case, the target of tin-foil-hattery is the Ada Initiative, an organization with pretty straightforward and, to most normal people, noncontroversial goals: be more sensitive to the ways tech can be unwelcoming for women. It is a giant leap from these goals to “They are probably trying to frame men for rape,” but if you’re an angry online anti-feminist — or someone who profits off their clicks — it’s a depressingly easy one to make.
There are many people on the internet who vocally oppose feminism, and it would be impossible — and, from a mental-health standpoint, unwise — to pay attention to them all. Since online anti-feminism is a big, roiling, loosely affiliated movement consisting of overlapping circles of Gamergaters, libertarian techbros, far-right men’s-right activists, and all sorts of other denizens who are really, really upset that women have so much power (insert air quotes) in today’s world, there’s a lot going on there, and it’s easiest to just tune out most of it.
But sometimes, a conspiracy theory bubbles forth from this ooze that’s too perfect to ignore — too wonderful an example of the flamboyant pathologies that undergird anti-feminism. One such conspiracy theory is racing across the internet right this moment, and it is the Platonic ideal of manospheric derangement.
Yesterday, Eric S. Raymond, a software developer and open-source software advocate, published an explosive allegation on his blog: a recently disbanded group called the Ada Initiative, which advertises itself as helping make tech more welcoming for women, had been attempting to entrap men by using “honey pots” to seduce them and then accuse them of rape. “The MO was to get alone with the target, and then immediately after cry ‘attempted sexual assault,” wrote Raymond’s source, an IRC correspondent he doesn’t name but who he says has been “both well-informed and completely trustworthy in the past.”
Worst of all, these evil feminists have been gunning for a high-profile target: Linus Torvalds, the tech-hero founder of Linux. “Linus hasn’t spoken out about this; I can think of several plausible and good reasons for that,” writes Raymond. “And the Ada Initiative shut down earlier this year. Nevertheless, this report is consistent with reports of SJW [social-justice-warrior, a derogatory term used frequently in anti-feminist writing] dezinformatsiya tactics from elsewhere and I think it would be safest to assume that they are being replicated by other women-in-tech groups.”
By most standards, this is a bit too explosive — or crazy, to be less diplomatic about it — a claim to make based on a brief IRC chat with an unnamed correspondent, but this didn’t stop Raymond from hitting publish. And once he did, his post wriggled its way through the anti-feminist web’s intestinal tract: First, Breitbart Tech’s Allum Bokhari — the site’s supposed token liberal — wrote it up. “If true,” he tutted, “these claims will rock the world of software development, not to mention the wider tech community, which is suffering under the yoke of diversity campaigners levelling bogus charges of sexism at companies and individuals and pestering companies to improve their diversity credentials.” If true, indeed!
The peristaltic movement of the misogynist web finally nudged the story to its inevitable destination: Someone posted Bokhari’s story to KotakuInAction, Gamergate’s subreddit, with the declarative headline: “SJWs attempting to frame Linus (of Linux Fame) for Sexual Assault.” Naturally, it climbed to near the top of the site.
Why, you might ask, has such a dumb, thinly sourced thing gone so viral? Because it’s basically the perfect rumor of this subgenre, in that it ticks off just about every wild-eyed belief endemic to online anti-feminism. To wit, this rumor has three delicious nuggets that the average anti-feminist would find hard to resist:
Who is at fault if someone steals a phone and distributes the material on it: the phone’s owner or the thief? The answer would seem pretty obvious to everyone but administrators at a South Carolina high school, where teacher Leigh Anne Arthur was forced to resign after a student grabbed her phone and sent the nude photos on it to classmates.
From Reason:
According to local news reports, the student also posted some of the images on social media.
Arthur — who had taught at the school for 13 years — was given the choice of resigning or starting firing procedures. The blame was placed on her for not password-protecting her phone. “The whole premise of my privacy is being ignored,” she told a local CBS affiliate.
The county’s interim superintendent, David Eubanks, implied that Arthur could face legal action for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He told The State, “I think we have a right to privacy, but when we take inappropriate information or pictures, we had best make sure it remains private.”
A petition to get Arthur her job back (apparently started by students) has been circulating in the aftermath, though Arthur expressed uncertainty over whether she would return, regardless. She also said that she forgives the student who accessed her phone, attributing the incident to the “stupid decisions” of a 16-year-old.
Sacrificing appliances in exchange for viral-video hits is a longstanding tradition on the internet, going back so far that a video of someone throwing a brick into a spinning washing machine was once set to the Harlem Shake. Remember the Harlem Shake? No? Ask your parents. But even after all these years, people continue to innovate in the field of washing-machine self-destruct videos: The latest adds a trampoline, which turns out to be absolutely brilliant.
Instead of quaking, flopping over, and vibrating itself to pieces, this brick-laden washer bounces up and down and looks like it’s having a great time. (It’s tempting to anthropomorphize dying appliances: See this famous GIF and also the entirety of the animated film The Brave Little Toaster.)
Then the inevitable happens: The happy-go-lucky machine falls off the trampoline and goes to bits like all the others. RIP, little fella.
The creator of the video, one “bootsowen,” is apparently a washing-machine-murdering psychopath. His various YouTube appliance snuff films include a washer’s “full destruction,” a video where he throws pop cans and bricks into a machine, and another where he uses a washer’s still-spinning corpse as a fire pit.
Actually, that last one might be the work of a mad genius. You should probably watch it right now and satisfy your morbid curiosity:
That game turned Barkley into prime meme material in 2008, and he subsequently became the face of r/ComeOnAndSlam.
YouTube’s search function won’t display more than 1,000 results, but an unscientific search for the string “Quad City DJs vs.” returned 99,700 results. Here is a playlist with 630 different videos. Browsing them also reveals a few other unsurprising trends. Many of the mashups are “Space Jam” combined with a video-game soundtrack. This is partially related to fandom; the groups of “people who play video games obsessively” and “people who spend a lot of time online” often overlap. The other part is that, on a technical level, video-game music is meant to repeat indefinitely, with no beginning or end, making it easy to include in mashups. For similar reasons, mashups with anime theme songs are also very prevalent.
The odds are pretty good that a band you like has a “Space Jam” remix. I encourage you to search one out. And if, for some reason, it doesn’t exist, you can always make a request.
Now, please enjoy “Uptown Dunk,” which is exactly what you think it is.
“Subreddit Spotlight” is a new semi-regular column on Following spotlighting Reddit’s most important communities. Know a subreddit that deserves a spotlight? Email me: brian.feldman@nymag.com.
Every day, life tests us with millions of questions. Why was I put on this Earth? What is the meaning of life? How can I maximize happiness during my brief existence? What would my favorite songs sound like mashed up with the Quad City DJ’s track “Space Jam” from the film of the same name?
I dunno about the first three. But I can tell you that the answer to the last question lies on r/ComeOnAndSlam, a collection of the web’s best “Space Jam” mashups. There are thousands out there.
Quad City DJ’s vs. Skrillex. Quad City DJ’s vs. Cher. Quad City DJ’s vs. Carly Rae Jepsen. Quad City DJ’s vs. Macklemore. Quad City DJ’s vs. Mulan. Quad City DJ’s vs. Smash Mouth. Quad City DJ’s vs. Backstreet Boys. Quad City DJ’s vs. the Who.
In addition to the musical work, there are two other rules of “Space Jam” remixing that must be adhered to. First, the title must be converted to a basketball pun, ideally containing the words slam, jam, and/or Barkley. For instance, “Everybody (Backstreet’s Back)” becomes “Everyballer (Barkley’s Back).” Secondly, Charles Barkley should be Photoshopped into the album art.
Why these remixes are so pervasive online requires a little bit of unpacking. On a base level, “Space Jam” is a hallmark of ‘90s nostalgia. Do you remember the ‘90s? Then you remember Space Jam, and transitively, you love Space Jam.
“But wait!” you say. “Wasn’t Michael Jordan the star of Space Jam? Not Charles Barkley?” That is also true. Why Barkley has become the face of Space Jam is not immediately clear; it seems the result of an unknowable process of context-removal that has occurred slowly over the course of several years. A very solid guess is that Barkley-as-meme can be traced to the indie game Barkley, Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden, which has one of the best sci-fi premises I’ve ever seen.
For reasons not quite discernible to me, for the past 13 days, the actor and former football player Terry Crews has been posting a series of videos on Facebook about his struggles with pornography addiction. They’re convincingly heartfelt and moving and full of real-talk self-help about “proud” and “self-pitying” men, “fearful” women, and how internet porn kills relationships. He’s quite adamant on that point; in the second video, while driving down La Cienega Boulevard in West Hollywood, he instructs (presumably fearful) women to be “fearless” and take control of their man’s own pornography addiction. “You cannot accept any pornography in your man’s life,” he instructs. “Terry Crews! I’m ridin’ around in L.A. with the top down! Woo-hoo!” he yells about a minute later.
Crews blames the advent of internet porn for the intensity of his addiction, which he says he went to rehab for. “Being on the internet allows you to keep it a secret,” he says. “Before you might have to go search it out, or go look for it, or go to a strip club … but this is a secret. No one can see you at all. You could be all alone … But I’m trying to tell you, that makes it all the more insidious and all the more we have to root it out and call it what it is. It’s kind of like how, when there’s a roach in your house, I promise you there’s 10,000 more roaches.” As of press time it’s unclear what exactly that simile means.
Since 2014, when he published his memoir, Manhood, Crews has been proselytizing against pornography and its harms. Along the way, he linked up with Mormon anti-porn group Fight the New Drug, which is most notable for the “PORN KILLS LOVE/FIGHT FOR LOVE” billboards plastered across San Francisco late last year. Though the group denies direct ties to the Mormon church, every founding member is Mormon, and as the Daily Beast reported last year, FTND’s director of research, Dr. Jason Carroll, is a Brigham Young University professor who’s repeatedly argued that same-sex marriage will not only cause the nation’s fertility rates to plummet, but also weaken the very “connection of heterosexual men to marriage and fatherhood.”
Though Crews doesn’t explicitly mention FTND’s name in his videos, he has openly endorsed the group in the past, and FTND has been using his Facebook videos, which have very little to do with science and more to do with relationship advice, to spread their word. (Not that he objects — he retweeted their blog post about him this morning.)
However, it appears FTND has little actual, uh, science to stand on, though they claimed to the Daily Beast that they are “founded on thousands of peer-reviewed research studies from top-tier neuroscientists, clinical psychologists, sociologists, and more.” Much of the research presumably overseen, or at least curated, by Carroll is largely made up of “writings in pop psychology and by writers who are not conducting actual research, and who do not have backgrounds in sexuality research or treatment,” David Ley, a clinical psychologist, told the Daily Beast. Maybe Ley just hasn’t visited Terry Crews’s Facebook page.
Another week, another open letter on Medium written by a recently fired, low-level Yelp employee detailing mistreatment and a disturbing lack of empathy from Yelp managers. Jaymee Senigaglia, who was an associate account executive (read: telemarketer) from December until very recently, wrote that despite proving herself early and often as an able salesperson and employee, Yelp managers prevented her from leaving work early to care for her son, who had bronchitis, as well as told her she would be fired if she chose to stay in the ICU with her boyfriend, who had been injured mountain biking. She ended up staying.
“I am the single mother who had Yelp’s back because I thought they had mine,” Senigaglia wrote (bolding hers). “I am the single mother who was the top of my class in training for you Jeremy and absolutely did not let you down but the way you treat parents as an employer is a little confusing.”
Nearly two weeks ago, a 25-year-old Yelp employee named Talia Ben-Ora wrote an open letter to CEO Jeremy Stoppelman detailing her struggle to make ends meet in San Francisco as a customer-service rep:
She was fired the same day. On Twitter, Stoppelman wrote that he was “focused” on the issue of lowering San Francisco’s soaring housing costs, and said he was not “personally involved” in her firing. Another woman, 29-year-old Stephanie Williams, wrote her own open letter criticizing Ben-Ora for, I guess, being a whiny millennial; Senigaglia has, so far, in the twelve hours since her letter was posted, avoided the same kind of “your bad job is your own fault.” Though I’m sure those responses are coming! Can’t wait.
Update: Yelp has issued a statement on Twitter:
Another day, another irritating iOS bug: Apple’s currently dealing with, among other things, a URL glitch causing its Safari and Mail apps to lock up.
The glitch stems from how iOS handles what it calls "universal links." You’ll be familiar with them if you’ve ever tapped a hyperlink to YouTube, for example, and it opened up the YouTube app. Universal links direct users to content within an app, rather than a standard web page.
iOS handles these by using files known as association files. Usually, those files — coded by individual developers and not by Apple — are very small, but occasionally, they’re not. Developers for apps like booking.com and Wikipedia reportedly included every single URL on their domain, resulting in relatively enormous files that caused the apps to crash.
Apple says that it’s working on a fix on its end, but the root of the issue is that developers were implementing universal links poorly. Exactly when the patch will go live is unclear.
It’s a fact well known to the average person that #brands should never give the public creative control over anything they do online. This conventional wisdom, however, has never trickled down to marketers or the suits who sign off on their work. Since the early days of Twitter, brands like Skittles have been naïvely inviting users to distort their messaging and vandalize their websites. It’s always a lot of fun for human people! (Not for corporations.)
The latest corporate marketing mistake to be released into the wild and transmogrified into art is this Coca-Cola GIF-maker. “GIF the feeling,” it beckons to you. Twitter savant and internet humorist Henry Birdseye, a.k.a. TehAwesome, heard the call, and he answered it. Boy, did he answer it.
Here are some of the singular feelings that Henry GIF(f)ed.
Truly, the Coca-Cola Company should present him with an award for his creative labor on their behalf. Certainly, tens of customers felt compelled to buy a Coke after seeing this. Or jump into a pool while still holding their phones. Whatever! Who cares? This is brilliant marketing!
You can’t pay for marketing like this — you can only inflict it on yourself for free, through a series of mistakes that could have been avoided at any of several points in your corporate organizational chart.
But they weren’t, and now that’s our gain.
The Awl is looking for an editor or two: John Herrman and Matt Buchanan, who have co-edited the influential blog for two years, are both leaving within the next few weeks.
Herrman’s headed to the New York Times — he was announced as one of the paper’s David Carr fellows this morning — and Buchanan is either “looking for a job” or “finally going to med school,” he told me over DM. “I sort of think running the Awl should maybe be a two-year position anyway,” he says. “Maybe we should call it a fellowship.”
Despite the worries of Media Twitter, the Awl isn’t going anywhere: “The Awl, which is now one of the last independent publishers left standing on the web — we’ve still never taken anyone’s money!!! — has never been as widely read or influential as it is right now,” Buchanan says, “which is why it’s in the perfect place for someone newer, younger, and smarter than a couple of straight white dudes to take over and do something far more interesting with it.”
The co-editors, who previously edited BuzzFeed’s FWD section together before Buchanan left for The New Yorker, announced the departure today in a blog post entitled, characteristically, “Job Open (Again).”
In the two years since taking over from founders Alex Balk and Choire Sicha (who recently took a job at Vox Media), Buchanan and Herrman had made the job an essential daily read for anyone interested in media, food, politics, real estate, and the infinity of time and space — among other things. (Full disclosure: I once wrote about collectible card games for the Awl.)
Click through for the full Instagram diary entry.
Instagram limits each caption to 2,200 characters. The potential length becomes extremely annoying as a marketing tool, and brands often abuse it to post contests or elaborate copy (see this explainer from Crowdfire). But in the hands of an average user, it provides plenty of space for a few observations of “the enormous and simple beauty of ordinary life,” as @keishua_ writes in one post, a snapshot of her cat gazing out the window.
Cate Butler’s Instagram captions tend toward the quality of a lifestyle blog, memorializing meals made and books read in a Ina Garten–level syrup. “Sometimes breakfast for lunch is a necessity,” Butler, a freelance marketer in Utah, writes. Elsewhere, she notes: “I find myself looking forward to soft woolly sweaters.” “Like everyone else, I started with a Facebook account, then Twitter, Tumblr, etc., but they all lacked something,” Butler tells me. “What I wanted to post about, and what I cared about, I quickly found other social networks didn’t have.”
Another appeal is the community of Instagram’s built-in audience. Dutch doll-maker Sophia Smeekens-Starrenburg found “other creatives, mothers, and people that try slow and spiritual living” through Instagram, as well as real-life friends, she says. It became a place “where I can tell my life story in square pieces. Easy to access and quick.” This means sharing uncomfortable feelings as well as joy. Smeekens-Starrenburg recently recounted her miscarriage in an elegiac post.
Instagram caption-blogging tends toward the trials and mundanities of everyday life, separating it from “blogging” as we think of it today — interlinked, news-focused dialogue and debate. Instagram comments aren’t threaded, re-sharing requires an outside app, and the character limits mean subtle arguments are hard to make. Also: You’re forced to type on an annoying-to-use mobile keyboard.
Still, what makes Instagram an attractive blogging platform for some makes it terrible for others. What’s the point in writing if you can’t be an #influencer, participating in an ongoing collective debate? A less structured, more communicative platform like Medium will always be better for topical discussion, if that’s what you’re after. Instagram is designed for lifestyle content; it’s not going to replace a website CMS anytime soon.
But the app’s simplicity and ease of use makes it perfect for people who are looking to communicate with little friction with a small, direct audience. Best of all, Instagram still feels “private,” even when it’s not: It’s rare to encounter strangers or trolls; old classmates and distant relatives are unlikely to follow you and even less likely to leave comments. If Facebook, where your short life update could wind up in a friend-of-a-friend’s newsfeed without you realizing it, is a minefield, Instagram is a clearing: quiet, safe, pretty, and more than a little twee.
In this sense Instagram feels less like Blogspot, and more like Livejournal. You don’t read it for debate or argument, but to know what your friends are doing and feeling. Most Instagram blogging requires a certain amount of innate sympathy to find compelling. But opening the app can be a nice return to an older internet, where people felt more open and less paranoid about sharing the endearing ordinariness of their everyday lives online.
The last thing you expect from the Rock is long-windedness. But Dwayne Johnson is a veritable novelist on Instagram, where he documents his days, which are composed chiefly of pumping iron at the gym, playing with his dogs, and eating snacks on private jets. Take, for example, this post from Labor Day, in which Johnson tells the gripping story of jumping into his pool with two baby French bulldogs in no less than 240 words. Spoiler: The dogs almost drown, but the Rock saves them.
To be sure, Instagram’s use as a blogging platform is not exactly widespread, yet. On vacation in Spain this year, I tried an experiment with journaling on the platform, writing out diary entries and posting them as images alongside the usual tourist snapshots. It reached my friends more directly and felt less exposed than Facebook, but that doesn’t mean it was particularly compelling. Most of the posts got fewer likes than a selfie or a shot of a cute dog.
The platform is “very performative,” Japanwala says. Self-expression and intimacy are implied, but not always present or reciprocated. “For every day in my life that I paint for someone else, I want them to paint their day back for me,” she adds. “Perhaps that’s unrealistic.” But as Instagram grows, and as users abandon the confusing din of Facebook for the relative quiet of its filtered feed, it will become the platform of choice for documenting our lives. And we’ll look back on the Rock as a pioneer.
Instagram, a minimalist, mobile-focused app for sharing photos, might seem like a strange place to keep a public diary. Facebook, which aggressively positions itself as an ongoing digital record of your life, comes across as a more natural place to share updates and idle musings. But the Rock’s not alone: People are increasingly turning toward Instagram not just as a place to post filtered photos, but to spill their lives and thoughts into the captions as well.
Why is this happening? For one thing, if you’re already posting pretentious, evocative images, you’re more likely to be in an artsy-musings state of mind. But it’s more than that: Facebook, at 1.5 billion users, has felt cacophonous and impersonal for a while. Many of us use it as an address book more than a means of communication; with its sheer density of information, writing a sincere post there feels a little like shouting on the streets of Manhattan. Instagram might eventually grow as large as Facebook, but its uncomplicated design and tightly curated feed make it more than just a photo app — it’s also one of the more potent blogging spaces around.
Natasha Japanwala, a start-up employee and writer in London, was feeling frustrated with larger social networks when she turned to Instagram for blogging. “Facebook is daunting in a way that Instagram is not yet because literally everyone I know is on Facebook,” she says. “Posting on Facebook can be an almost political act. On Instagram I have a little more freedom to just be me.”
Japanwala’s Instagram is a series of moments drawn from her life in London that, though not quite as dramatic as the Rock’s stories, are compelling in their brevity. One recent post narrates how on a walk through the foggy city she came upon a houseboat turned into a bookstore parked on a canal. Another observes an out-of-the-way coffee shop with novelistic precision: “the kind of place where mothers come to read with their newborn babies strapped onto them.” “I like to use it to push myself to find and relay the minutiae of the everyday with as much piercing detail as is possible,” she says. “I wanted a long-form and intimate correspondence.”
After catapulting his shoe-wearing friend, Daniel, to viral fame, Josh Holz quickly became the target of attacks, cyber and otherwise. Last week, his house was SWAT’ed by schmucks, and this week, hackers took over his Twitter account, deleting the original video.
Holz has since regained control of his account, but not before some “really sick people,” in Holz’s words, were able to post garbage.
“Damn, Daniel” is still around on YouTube, but that original post, which had racked up hundreds of thousands of likes and retweets, is likely gone forever.
RIP, original “Damn, Daniel” video. You are back at it again with the white Vans in heaven.

What is new, however, is internet entrepreneurs viewing the large market for faith-based services as a business opportunity. “We’re trying to add a professional element to puja, which hasn’t been done before,” Vardhan, who is also Shubhpuja’s CEO, says. The goal is to provide “very customized, authentic pujas” for her customers. In general, modern technology seems to have accelerated, rather than dampened, Indian spending on religion. In 2012, about 20-25 percent of total mobile downloads were for religious or devotional content, compared to 15-20 percent in 2010. Vedicvaani.com, launched around the same time as Shubhpuja, is a religious item shop that offers more than 2,000 products for sale. For India’s 177 million Muslims, startups like Hajjnet have developed mobile apps to help those making the holy annual pilgrimage to Mecca organize the logistics of their trip.
Another one of these startups, OnlinePrasad, offers prasad (small blessed offerings, usually food) for sale from “top temples” all around India. Traditionally, one goes to a temple to receive prasad in person, but with OnlinePrasad you can have the holy package shipped right to your door from a temple hundreds of miles away. OnlinePrasad also sells tickets for special expedited temple visits called “Quick Darshan,” ensuring “maximum convenience” for those making religious pilgrimages. Like Vardhan at Shubhpuja, OnlinePrasad’s founder Goonjan Mall also has a consulting background, and left Bain & Co. to bootstrap the startup in 2012, out of a frustration with the often crowded and mismanaged temple experience that persists through most of India. Mall told a reporter for CNBC that the idea “came in a flash”: “Religion must be simplified and technology was the perfect tool” to do so in India.
Browsing through OnlinePrasad recently, I landed upon prasad from the historical temple of Sai Baba, a famous universalist guru active in the late 19th century. Not only is prasad from Sai Baba’s temple one of the best-selling items on OnlinePrasad’s “Top Temples” list, but it also has an average five-star rating from over 45 reviews: “When I opened the box,” one customer wrote, “I felt the divinity & presence of my lord.”
After an item is ordered, an OnlinePrasad representative will offer prasad on the customer’s behalf (in this case at the Sai Baba temple in Shirdi near India’s west coast), pack up the prasad with other little gifts, and send it off to the customer via courier. I ordered a pack of “Prasad + Golden Sai Poster,” and just over a week later, it arrived at my apartment in New York.
The prasad came with a small “sacred thread,” a golden poster of Sai Baba on a throne, a mini Sai Baba–branded 2016 calendar, and, finally, the pièce de résistance — a sealed-in-plastic packet of edible rewri prasad (a sesame-toffee-like sweet) as well as some ash prasad from the temple’s holy flame.
Both OnlinePrasad and Shubhpuja have attracted investor interest. “With 1.2 billion people and 330 million gods and goddesses in India,” early OnlinePrasad investor K Ganesh told the Times of India, “faith [is] price inelastic.” Ganesh said in a separate interview that the online religious market is “recession-proof” because “people resort to faith in good times and bad times.” Also, Ganesh pointed out, “nobody negotiates with God!”
One particularly lucrative market for the businesses is the Indian diaspora. I spoke with Shubhpuja customer Adesh Narain, an investment banker from Delhi who has been working in the Middle East for over a decade. In Kuwait, where he lives and Islam is the official state religion, Narain told me that “there are no pandits, no resources” for him to practice his Hindu faith. Narain considered flying home to Delhi to do a puja in honor of his parents, but tried out Shubhpuja instead and organized a puja he could call into with Whatsapp. Young urban Indians like himself, Narain said, are often “not that well-educated about religion” — when a priest recites Sanskrit mantras, it’s “hard to know whether they’re doing it right or wrong.” Shubhpuja “talks my language,” he told me, and “there is no feeling of being gypped.”
I grew up nonreligious in the U.S., yet I remember visiting several famous temple sites on trips to India with my dad. His family is from a Jain background, a different religion entirely, but we still went as tourists to pay our respects to Hinduism’s great gods. We waited in long lines in dank, teeming hundred-year-old passageways to reach the inner sanctums, clasp our hands in prayer, and receive a bite of prasad. On one such trip, to the Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai, my dad noticed something new: an expedited line. For about $1 each, we skipped the hourlong line of worshippers and went through a shorter one to see the deity and get our prasad. Many large temples now offer these VIP services — those who can afford a premium can get to God quicker, while the poorer devotees must wait their turn.
At their core, services like OnlinePrasad and Shubhpuja are simply 21st-century, tech-enabled manifestations of this class-based branching of religious experience. They bring a new level of efficiency to worshipping — but, like the VIP line, only for the well-off Indians who can afford it. India’s rife and rising economic inequality is obvious to anyone who steps foot on a Mumbai street: 90 percent of Indians own less than a quarter of the country’s wealth. Yet places like the Meenakshi Amman Temple are equally revered by India’s paupers and millionaires. Now that religious blessings are available à la carte online, perhaps the temples will start to see fewer of the VIPs in person. India’s ancient homes of God, grand melting pots ostensibly devoid of class divisions, may become just as changed by income inequality as its schools and hospitals.
The sun hadn’t yet risen in New York when I opened my laptop and signed onto Skype, but it was almost 5 p.m. Indian Standard Time — my proper muhūrta, the moment at which my planetary energies are aligned.
But in the meantime, it’s hard to argue that these services don’t make religion more convenient, courteous, and efficient — even if a believer is connecting to their faith over Skype. One thing seems certain: If these services work well, they will spread like wildfire. As one of OnlinePrasad’s seed investors Nandini Guglani noted, “Religion is the most viral business in India.”
I was greeted by an image of a bright room somewhere in New Delhi, where three men were already well into their preparations for a puja, a Hindu devotional prayer ritual on my behalf. One was the priest leading the ritual, wearing a light-pink kurta. One was a man named Acharya Vivek, who was to be my physical stand-in while I watched on my laptop (the title acharya signifies a learned religious man). And the third was Acharya Keshav, the man who’d organized the puja on my behalf, through a “religious platform” startup called Shubhpuja.
Shubhpuja, which bills itself as a platform that facilitates “connections to God in one click,” was launched in 2013 by Saumya Vardhan, a former consultant at KPMG and Ernst & Young in London. The company has a large network of pandits (Hindu scholars), astrologers, and other experts in traditional Indian religious practices that it connects with would-be worshippers to organize prayers and consultations. It’s just one of several tech startups that have recently emerged in India to capitalize on the country’s lucrative spiritual and religious market — estimated at $30 billion per year.
Acharya Keshav had made sure I was prepared with a glass of water and a plate of sugar and rice to be used during the ceremony. Portraits of the elephant-headed god Ganesh (who is worshipped before any new venture) as well as the goddess Saraswati (worshipped for success in education) were set up, with a lit candle flickering in front of them. The men were seated cross-legged on the floor, and laid out in front of them were small plates of sweets, bananas, and flowers that would be offered to the gods.
Acharya Keshav patiently walked me through the different stages of the puja, as the priest began a series of Sanskrit prayers in a melodic singsong. I was asked to fill in my birth month — July — and birthplace — Colorado — as well as parrot some Sanskrit lines after the priest said them. I watched as a bracelet was tied around Acharya Vivek’s wrist, in place of my absent one. Acharya Keshav instructed me several times to “put some water on the Earth!” by sprinkling a few drops of water in front of my MacBook. Skype dropped the call twice, and we had to reconnect. At one point, the priest blew a conch shell, and everyone stood up, which brought all three men out of my laptop’s field of view. I could still hear young kids playing in the background, and a Delhi train passing in the distance.
After about an hour, Acharya Keshav told me I could sign off. As a nice Shubhpuja convenience, the acharyas would continue the next hour of the puja without me having to be present through Skype. I’d gotten my own prayer ceremony without needing to do much more than press a button and fill out a form — basically Uber, but for god.
Religion has been an omnipresent force in the homes and lives of most South Asians since long before smartphones and e-commerce. The subcontinent has a diverse range of sometimes overlapping belief systems, and a unique fervor for spirituality. Within many Hindu communities in India, religious customs oversee everything from marriage to business. And instead of being relegated to churches and synagogues, Hindu religious practice in India is often split between the home and the temple. A survey of households in the state of West Bengal found that 89 percent of respondents spent money for “performing religious rites at home,” which might include household shrines and materials for puja. Outside the home, Indians of all ages and means spend their hard-earned cash to go visit places of worship near and far — a massive, growing phenomenon sometimes called “religious tourism.” Today, 50 percent of leisure travel in India is related to religious tourism, and the most famous temples attract thousands of visitors daily year-round.
Also not a new phenomenon: making money off of religion in India. “Everyone in the country spends money on religious things,” Vardhan told me. “Even if a person does not spend on Amazon and Flipkart, they will spend on puja and giving donations to temples.” At certain temples in southern India, women shave their heads and offer their hair as a religious tribute that is sometimes repackaged and sold off by the temples as “temple hair” — ending up for sale as hair extensions in high-end salons in the U.S. and Europe. One of India’s most famous spiritual leaders, Baba Ramdev, has quietly been building one of the country’s largest consumer goods companies based off his audience of devotees.
Boston Dynamics, the company closest to manufacturing a T–1000, has reportedly been put up for sale by owner Google. BD was acquired by Google a little over two years ago, as it looked further into robotics, the humanoid, and, uh, dog-anoid robots seemed like a good complement to Google’s automated-car programs.
But walking robots, as cool as they are, are not profitable. According to Bloomberg, executives at Alphabet, Google’s parent company, became concerned that Boston Dynamics had no “plans to generate real revenue” and “isn’t likely to produce a marketable product in the next few years.“ Furthermore, rotating leadership has hindered the division’s progress over the past few years, and they were reportedly reluctant to work with other Google divisions. Though I will admit I would buy a Cheetah for $75 at Sharper Image.
Before its acquisition, much of Boston Dynamics’ work came from lucrative military projects, which generally don’t require developing products for mass market. Under Google, however, they did not accept military contracts (though they honored existing ones), and so the pressure to come up with sustainable revenue increased considerably. Here’s an idea: Make the robots fight and charge a pay-per-view fee.
Tumblr was rocked to its very core last December by a situation now known as Boneghazi — the last great meme of 2015. In a screenshot circulating on the blog network, a witch named Ender Darling offered up some human bones for sale, allegedly collected from a local New Orleans cemetery. What followed was a simultaneously amused and horrified discourse about witchcraft, spells, class, and race.
We now know what happened in the aftermath. Suspected of trafficking in human remains, Darling’s home was subject to “periodic surveillances” over six days in January, according to the New Orleans Advocate. On January 28, the home was raided by investigators who, according to court records obtained by the Advocate, “recovered at least 11 bones and four teeth.”
The investigation is ongoing.
Darling received tons of threats after the initial offer to send collected bone fragments to other witches, and admitted to sending “one human tooth and two human shards” to someone, asking only for enough money to cover the cost of shipping.
Darling has since moved to Florida, partially because of safety concerns.
A cat got into a scuffle with a bee and ended up getting stung in the nose — and now both the unfortunate cat and its swollen sniffer are big in Japan.
The photo of the sad cat and its oversize novelty clown nose appears to have originated in November on Reddit’s photos forum, r/pics, apparently taken by the cat’s owner. The original poster commented that the cat was okay, and assured everyone it had been taken to the vet.
Bee-sting cat proved popular on U.S.-based Reddit, but it was even more popular in Japan. Illustrator Masashi Kuroda tweeted the cat the next day, along with photos of a few other feline bee-sting victims. His post was an instant hit.
Kuroda got 17,000 retweets, and bee-sting cat was reportedly trending on Twitter in Japan.
Japanese news sites started to pick up the story, too, explaining that part of the cat’s appeal is how nonchalant it seems about its conspicuously bulging nose. The photo also ended up on 2chan, the Japanese image board that inspired an infamous American spinoff, 4chan. Anonymous users there compared the poor kitty to Japanese cartoon icon Doraemon.
Hard to argue with that.
One of the breakout YouTube videos of the year shows two Boston bros on a boat flipping out over “witnessin’ a baby whale here, dude!” The marine creature they’re describing in their heavy Boston accents is actually an ocean sunfish — but no matter, the video is hilarious. And a remix that arrived this week might be even better.
Tom Hyndman has married the Boston bros’ commentary on their “baby fuhken wheel” with the trailer for Ron Howard’s long-delayed In the Heart of the Sea, a seafaring adventure based on real-life events that inspired Melville’s Moby-Dick. The movie finally opened Friday, just a few days after Hyndman’s improved, Masshole-flavored trailer went up on YouTube.
The timing couldn’t be better, kid! And, at some point in Mikey Bergin’s hysterical shouting about the “wheel,” he even calls the “monstrous fuhken thing” Moby Dick. Holy fuhken shit! It’s perfect, bro. And can you believe that’s the size of the hook Chris Hemsworth wants to use? We’ve got a baby wheel here!
Passengers on an Alaska Airlines flight to Hawaii this week got a nice treat when the flight changed its plan slightly in order to accommodate a handful of solar-eclipse chasers hoping to experience the “path of totality” — the darkest part of the moon’s shadow.
The flight seems to have gone well, if this video from Joe Rao, one of the spectators, is any indication.
This guy is excited! That said, if you were unaware of the eclipse, a man on your plane screaming “Oh my god!” and “Corona!” and “Totality! Totality!” might be a little weird.
But anyway, congratulations to all of the eclipse watchers! Big day for you!
Though the technology is mostly there, driverless cars are still a source of anxiety. There are many hypothetical scenarios in which a driverless car might kill you. Driving off a bridge, driving into a head-on collision, driving into a deep ravine, driving into a toxic swamp filled with hungry crocodiles. All of these are equally plausible scenarios.
But driverless cars might also kill in other ways. For instance, they might give their passengers a heart attack. Case in point, this video of a 70-year-old woman experiencing the thrill and the wonder of Tesla’s Autopilot mode.
“This is my first day out, and I’m about to die.” Aren’t we all, lady. Aren’t we all.
A new tech screed against the homeless pops up every few months, full of anger and dehumanizing language and proposing no solutions. Peter Shih, a start-up co-founder, attempt to defend his own terrible blog post as satire in 2013, and another complained about SF’s issues despite having once resided in city-subsidized low-income housing.
Maybe there’s an app that could fix this? Can code solve this?
Keller did end up apologizing for one thing in his letter.
Apparently, the rest of his message is fine, though. More than 2,000 people have given it an affirmative “kudos” on Svbtle.
Here’s a fun phrase that definitely won’t send a shiver down your spine: “Open letter from San Francisco–based entrepreneur.”
Letters from Bay Area entrepreneurs are usually just bad in a babbling, techno-utopian kind of way, so it’s sort of thrilling when a truly terrible one crosses our screens. Like this this missive from one Justin Keller, complaining that “[t]he city […] can no longer ignore it and let people do whatever they want in the city.” No: not Uber executives! But rather, the downtrodden and displaced. It is addressed to San Francisco’s mayor and police chief. Here is the opening sentence:
Okay, no red flags yet. San Francisco’s increasing homeless population — displaced by rapidly rising rent prices as the tech industry continues to flood the real-estate market — is a serious social and economic concern.
This sounds terrible. Hard to imagine a worse way to live!

In the later games, the Pokémon get better, in my opinion, because their creators get desperate.
There’s Gurdurr, the construction Pokémon that carries a steel I-beam.
There’s Cofagrigus, a sentient sarcophagus.
There’s Gothita, an honest-to-goodness goth Pokémon (who later evolves into Gothorita and Gothitelle).
There’s Honedge, a sword whose evolved form, Doubledge, is just two swords.
They feel so much weirder, so much more specific, so much more fuck-it-we’ll-do-it-live, than the earlier, just-a-cool-looking-cat Pokémon.
As time marches on unceasingly toward the heat-death of the universe, all things must submit to the forces of age and entropy. What was new becomes old; what was fresh is stale. Even Pokémon, which turns 20 on Saturday.
But my personal favorite Pokémon is not in the first 151. Out of 721 Pokémon, it falls three-quarters of the way down the list, at number 568. Meet Trubbish.
Trubbish, in case you couldn’t tell, is a Garbage Pokémon. It is a Garbage Pokémon in multiple respects. First of all, it is literally a bag of trash with a face. Secondly, Trubbish is garbage in the sense that, having already created 567 other unique creatures, the Pokémon brain trust decided, “Fuck it, we’re making a Pokémon that is an actual sentient garbage bag.” Trubbish is what happens when you’re scraping the bottom of the barrel. I love it.
Trubbish is, like all great jokes online, insanely relatable. Here are some descriptions of the heinous, adorable monster from various Pokémon games.
Same.
SAME.
Pokémon, invented in 1996 by Satoshi Tajiri, started off as a Game Boy game but quickly birthed a multimedia behemoth. The games didn’t show up Stateside until 1998, and by then an anime series and massively popular trading card game had already debuted in Japan, with an avalanche of feature films, toys, and apparel soon to follow. Even two decades later, Pokémon is still a massive breadwinner for Nintendo. Earlier today, the company announced the next pair of games in the franchise, Pokemon Sun and Moon.
Trubbish can evolve into Garbodor, who is literally (literally) just a bigger pile of trash.
The very existence of Trubbish makes me feel like anything is possible. Whenever I think a long-planned goal will never be accomplished, a long-held dream never realized, I take a step back, and say to myself: “Someone on the Pokémon team created a sentient bag of garbage with eyes and a mouth whose name is a portmanteau of ‘trash’ and ‘rubbish’ and then showed it to his or her boss, and the boss was like, ‘Yes, good, let’s put that in the game, definitely.’” That’s amazing. Anything can happen.
Happy 20th birthday, Pokémon. Thank you for Trubbish, a cute bag of crap.
It’s hard to believe that only two decades ago, these pocket monsters were unleashed across Japan, spawning a worldwide craze that continues to this day. If you went to elementary school between 1996 and 2008, you know about Pokémon. It was the most important thing in the world. Even if you didn’t own a Game Boy, you knew who Pikachu was. You loved Pikachu. Your dad loved Pikachu. "I love Pikachu so much" is the first thing your mom used to say every morning when she got out of bed. Your older brother went to prom with Pikachu. What I’m trying to say is, Pokémon: very popular.
If I were to ask a collection of people between the ages of 18 and 30 “What’s your favorite Pokémon?” the odds are pretty good that I’d get a wide array of answers. (That being said, I recently asked this question of each major-party presidential candidate and received no answers.) There are, after all, 721 known species of Pokémon (according to Bulbapedia, the premier resource for Pokémon info).
The odds are very good, however, that most people would choose a favorite toward the lower end of the scale, probably within the first 151 Pokémon. This group — the original batch — is held in high regard as the best batch of Pokémon. It has all your favorites: Pikachu, Charmander, Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Mew, et cetera, et cetera.
The early Pokémon are generally simple creations; obvious animal analogs with elemental powers. Pikachu was an electric rodent; Squirtle was a turtle with, I guess, water powers; Charmander was a fire lizard.
But as new Pokémon continue to be designed, the animals and plants available to Nintendo’s game creators obviously start to dwindle. All the cool ideas have been used. How many different snakes can be Pokémonized?
Like its predecessor, Shit Account 2015 is being run much like a March Madness tournament, with 60 contenders and another eight play-ins (and an honorary ghost of @ChuckCJohnson at No. 69). “I assembled a ‘Shitty Committee’ of 7 of my followers, and we ranked our top 25 worst accounts on a biweekly basis,” the person behind the account told me. “It worked exactly as the AP college polls work, with 25 points for first place votes, down to 1 point for a 25th. Once tourney time was to begin, we had enough data to accurately seed the accounts.” The seeding does appear to have worked: first-round match-ups included “@DraftKings vs. @Fanduel” and “@MeninistTweet vs. @MensHumor.”
The tournament’s four regions each have their own in-joke name. The Gott Mit Uns (German for “God with us”) region is a reference to the Nazi memorabilia that militant atheists point to whenever someone asserts that Hitler was an atheist; it’s mostly accounts relating to religious figures or relating to religion in some way.
The Maggot region, a “potpourri” of accounts that don’t fit into the other three, “is a play on one of the shitty accounts, @icpchad, who calls everyone ‘maggots’ and blocks them. Chad is a gun nut who has legitimately threatened people’s lives online, and I think he deserves the notoriety of being one of the shittiest accounts online.”
The #i2 region — heavy on men’s-rights activists — takes its name from a hashtag popular among the anti-circumcision crowd.
And last but not least, the Jade Helm region takes its name from the military exercises that sent Texan big-government conspiracy theorists into a frenzy this past summer. It’s vaguely sports-themed:
As we enter the 2015 homestretch, publications across the web are busy compiling their year-end lists — the best-ofs, the top-ten thingamajigs, the superlative whatchamacallits. On Twitter, one such year-end wrap-up has entered its final stage. It’s called the Shit Account Tournament and it’s seeking to name, once and for all, the shittiest Twitter account of 2015.
As in any good tournament, each round — the Shit Sixteen, the Excrement Eight, the Fuccboi Four — has contained a few surprises. Five-seed Donald Trump, for instance, was knocked out by 12-seed Adam Baldwin in the very first round. The tournament is probably making, for now, the best use of Twitter’s new polling feature, a step up from last year’s tourney, which used a Google survey that was susceptible to ballot manipulation.
And, as with any good tournament, there’s been some controversy along the way. Over the weekend, Shit Account alleged that Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos had stuffed the ballot box during his match-up in the Excrement Eight, and he was disqualified. Yiannopoulos had previously exhibited a dogged determination to win the tournament.
Shit Account told me over email, “I was sent evidence via a DM from my friends in which Milo gloated that he was rigging the tournament and wanted to win. I think we’ve seen the aftermath, after we took away the votes clearly submitted by Milo’s shitty followers … There was a discrepancy of about 1300 votes … so we took the appropriate action to remove the extra votes, rendering @CloydRivers [a popular account based on lowest-common-denominator redneck stereotypes] the champion of the #i2 Region.”
In a statement to Following, Yiannopoulos denounced the tournament:
“Milo is now beet red and nude online,” Shit Account says, “trying to confirm his supposed ‘dox’ of me … so he can do some shitty smear article on the guy he thinks I am.”
Regardless of surrounding controversy, the Fuccboi Four is about to wrap up, setting the stage for a tense championship round. Twitter has been especially terrible in 2015, so there’s a lot at stake for whoever takes the crown. In addition to having this superlative honor, they also win the Chuck C. Johnson Memorial Trophy.
Shit Account 2015 is where people have to make tough decisions. Pharmaceutical profiteer Martin Shkreli or conservative actor James Woods? Gamergate figurehead Adam Baldwin or atheist comedian Ricky Gervais (who is atheist, just a reminder)? Breitbart commentator Ben Shapiro or the Tweet of God, an account which bravely asks the question “What if God … had a Twitter account in 2009?”
Best of luck to the competitors!
It’s also the site of controversy. At least one contestant has been accused of ballot-stuffing, improper vote solicitation, and — the gravest sin of all — being mad online.
This week saw four contestants — the “Fuccboi Four” — duke it out for the final. “I think the Fuccboi Four of @TheTweetofGod, @RealJamesWoods, @CloydRivers and @TherealGeorgeZ [George Zimmerman] is a fantastically diverse mix of shitty,” the organizer told me. “Much like last year, the voters really came through.”
To understand why the Shit Account Tourney exists, and why its polls sometimes receive thousands of votes, it’s important to understand the state of Twitter in 2015. Where infrequent or casual users still use the service to follow favorite celebrities or catch up on news, heavy users — especially those interested in politics — seem to generally agree that Twitter has gotten bad, maybe unredeemably — chock-full of stupid, rude, misinformed, and maladapted people with extremely large megaphones. “The internet is a place where people can get their opinions out easily,” the tournament’s organizer told me yesterday, “and many of these opinions are absolute garbage.”
But rather than force mass eviction, the increasingly loud stupidity on display has become something to celebrate. The Shit Account Tourney was first held last year, its organizer told me, for the simple reason that “there are so many shitty accounts on Twitter.” (The organizer, who tweets from the official Twitter handle, agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity.) The 2014 title eventually went to Chuck C. Johnson, a widely reviled journalist who used his account to harass others and spread misinformation, and who was rumored to have once defecated on a floor in college. His account was suspended earlier this year.
Designating an account as “shitty” is, of course, a subjective evaluation, and as a matter of course Following does not endorse the tournament’s value judgments. But there’s a recognizable pattern among the Shit Account contestants, one that allows us to come up with a working definition of “shitty” for the purposes of the tournament — one that helps describe the kinds of accounts that can make Twitter such an alienating experience.
Many of the entrant accounts belong to notable white males in media. They tend to tweet with an aggressive, no-holds-barred “call ‘em like I see ‘em” mentality, and then can’t quite handle pushback. (James Woods, as an example, notably sued a pseudonymous Twitter user earlier this year for $10 million over claims of defamation; the user characterized Woods as a cocaine addict.) A Shit Account, for the sake of this tournament, belongs to someone who might charge that criticism of them is tantamount to violating their First Amendment rights, or the tactic of someone who has already lost the argument. Most of the blustery personalities in the bracket are conservative, but the idea is that the tweeting style is what determines their shittiness, not their beliefs as such. Pompous liberal Aaron Sorkin role-play account @WillMcAvoyACN ensures at least some bipartisan representation, as does the aforementioned Gervais. Some of them are just bad sports commentators, like Darren Rovell.
What’s the profit margin of a Shrek nude?
All funds go to Planned Parenthood — there’s a small fee for shipping, and a small fee extracted for a frame if they choose that option. When each nude patron receives their Shrek nude, it includes a letter from me explaining exactly how much money they have donated and I’m keeping meticulous records.
Why Shrek? What’s the draw for you personally?
I’ve been doing Shrek-related projects for a few years now after a friend and I discovered a live recording of Shrek: The Musical on Netflix. That incarnation of Shrek is so funny to me because seeing a grown human man dressed as Shrek is unequivocally hilarious. Seeing a grown man dressed as Shrek singing a very serious song that sounds like a Bon Jovi B-side about his big broken Shrek heart is even funnier, and local productions of said musical are the funniest thing in the world. So for a while I was going to local productions and bugging them — my favorite was going to Shrek: The Musical five times when I was writing for a site in Boston and tracking the toll it took from my sanity.
Is this something you’ve done before?
Sell nudes for charity? Nope!
How long do you plan to keep the shop open?
The shop will be open until January 1, so everyone can swipe up their Shrek nudes for each and every nondenominational holiday.
Do you plan to branch out into other animated characters, or things with large web followings?
On Monday, comedian Jamie Loftus launched Shrek Nudes, an Etsy shop selling “the nation’s finest framed Shrek nudes.” A Shrek nude, to be clear, is a nude photograph of Loftus covered in green paint, not a drawing of the actual big, green two-eyed monster and his big, green one-eyed monster. The shop is the latest in the internet’s ongoing torrid love affair with the Shrek franchise. All of the proceeds from the sales go to support Planned Parenthood. We reached out to Loftus to learn more about why naked Shrek, why Planned Parenthood — really just overall: Why?
Nah, I’m keeping it fully Shrek’d — there might be a point where I add some other Shrek-nude-related projects, collaborate with other comedians and artists off the idea of a Shrek nude, but that kind of remains to be seen. Right now, it’s the nudes, and if people don’t want the nudes, a donation in lieu of them.
What, specifically, is a Shrek nude? Can you describe what one looks like?
Without going too much into it — since part of what you buy a Shrek nude for is to solve that mystery, and also my dad will read this — a Shrek nude is, quite simply, a nude of me painted as a Shrek. They were taken after a performance as a Shrek stripper at a variety show at ImprovBoston last July, where my friend Jake and I sang a few songs from Shrek: The Musical wearing track suits, then stripped to “All Star” by Smash Mouth and went full Shrek. Very dumb, but 100 people came to see it. The nudes were taken after that performance at my apartment at the time.
What inspired you to set up the shop?
Given recent events, I wanted to think of an unorthodox way I could kick [Planned Parenthood] some cash that didn’t involve me having to run or bake or participate in a lip-dub or something else I’m bad at. The real idea behind it is that no matter how silly or bizarre an idea people think selling Shrek nudes is, it’s an idea that involves my body that’s 100 percent within my control. I did the performance, took the pictures myself, put them online myself, etc. These were all my choices and there wasn’t anyone there to tell me I couldn’t do it. I thought that concept contrasted with a lot of attitudes toward women’s health and choice. The important options PP offers women are, of course, far more consequential, but given the climate we’re living in, women don’t necessarily get the choice of what their access to the service will be. If one person’s choice regarding their body can keep the doors open to a place that gives other women important options regarding their health and bodies, then I think it’s a worthwhile thing to do. Also, Shrek is for women, duh.
How’s business going so far?
Business in the Shrek-nudes industry is booming! We are prepared for a second industrial revolution, minus all the typhus and child labor! And for people who don’t necessarily want pictures of my butt but do like the cause of the project, I have a separate fund-raising page set up. My ex-boyfriend gave to that one in lieu of a nude, which I find to be trés classy. [As of Wednesday morning, Loftus has sold 17 photos.]
Not quite big enough to have reached the academy: I showed some of my favorite founding-fandom posts to a few (frankly bewildered) historians who write about the American affection for the founding fathers, and asked them how they thought this new fandom fit into a longer tradition of founders worship. The fact that many of these bloggers are trying to know the founders as people — to unearth something of their essence, whether that essence be bisexuality or shortness or irascibility — reminded David Sehat, author of The Jefferson Rule: How the Founding Fathers Became Infallible and Our Politics Inflexible, of the intense personal interest in the founders that blossomed when the group started dying off in the early 19th century.
“Almost immediately after the founders died, people wanted some physical connection to them,” Sehat told me. “So Washington, for example, had this elaborate archive, and he kept all his letters, and he evidently had it beautifully organized … But when people would write to his literary executor, [the executor] took letters and he would just cut them up and send examples of Washington’s handwriting to basically whoever asked.” Right after Washington’s death, the author Mason Locke “Parson” Weems wrote a quickie biography of him, which was so fanciful that it could be considered fanfiction. (That’s where the cherry-tree story comes from.)
But the kind of playfulness around the founders’ sexuality that these posts represent is pretty new. While some political opponents and radical abolitionists might have whispered about Jefferson’s relationship with Sally Hemings in the 19th century, the topic was fairly taboo. Historian Andrew Schocket, author of Fighting Over the Founders: How We Remember the American Revolution, told me we didn’t start full-on speculating and making jokes about the founders’ sex lives until after the sexual revolution of the 1960s. The musical 1776, which poked gentle fun at the founders, debuted on Broadway in 1969; in the 1970s, when the country celebrated the bicentennial, Playboy ran two cartoons featuring an amorous George Washington. In an amazingly titled 2011 journal article “The Erotic Charisma of Alexander Hamilton” (which, by the way, I found out about on Tumblr), scholar Caroline V. Hamilton describes a fascination with Hamilton’s attractiveness that goes back decades, but has greatly expanded in recent years.
The internet has really helped this process along, giving like-minded people a place to meet and amplify their affection for historical figures. These Tumblr bloggers are the pop-cultural progeny of those first years of fun founders. Jaclyn, 21, who runs john-laurens, told me she first got interested in the topic because of 1776. And Schocket told me that students in his classes often invoke the early-2000s children’s TV show Liberty’s Kids.
On Tumblr, the founders’ sexuality is front and center. The idea that such famous and influential people might have been queer, and that historians might have erased that queerness, intrigues Tumblrers. “In my Googling of [Hamilton], I found out that he may have been bisexual, which, as a fellow bisexual person, sparked my interest that has lasted me these years,” wrote Yelyzaveta. Jaclyn engaged in a Tumblr exchange with Gregory Massey, a biographer of Laurens, in which the two challenged each other on the matter of Laurens’s relationship with Hamilton. And the blogger publius-esquire mused on historians’ perspectives on gayness, challenging the expert view, which holds that late-18th-century male friendships were more inherently romantic, so the sweet and longing words that Hamilton and Laurens wrote to each other in letters would not have been unusual. This topic taps both the platform’s interest in accepting and celebrating the varieties of human sexuality, and its distrust of much older, often white and male, experts.
What separates the kind of interest an academic historian has in a historical figure from the fervent attention a fan pays? Some of the feelings these bloggers have for their favorite founders are very familiar to me. What’s the difference between someone who runs a john-laurens fan blog and someone who (let’s just say, hypothetically) spent a semester in 2007 writing a masters’ thesis about the celebrity sled dogs of the early 20th century? Whether you’re accumulating Tumblr posts or citations, that feeling of greedy immersion and magpie curiosity is addictive.
Some Tumblrers might, as a few bloggers I interviewed worried, overcelebrate the founders, forgetting that they were multidimensional people. Others might, as one historian I interviewed fretted, be losing all sense of historical context in their relentless focus on one person or group of people. But in a social-media landscape where the charlatan @HistoryInPics account now has 2.86 million followers, the historical fandom on Tumblr — active, participatory, and self-policing — gives hope to this historian’s heart.
Right now, on Tumblr, the founding fathers are flirting.
Alexander Hamilton — you know, from the musical — is telling his real-life confidante John Laurens to “Draw me like one of your North American softshell turtles.” George Washington is busting James Madison and Thomas Jefferson for their ineptly hidden office romance. And Hamilton and Jefferson are competing to see which founding father can turn the other on more, in the middle of a meeting with Washington.
There is a lot of crap history on the internet, and at first glance the Tumblr founding-father fandom could seem to be another haven for quick-hit decontextualization and erroneous virality. (Founding father material on Tumblr is, quite often, not accurate; it’s not even meant to be. See above. See below.) But this little fandom is taking a much-canonized era in American history and forcefully ripping it open, sending exploding bits flying all over the place; for that, it should be praised.
Users running blogs like foundingfatherfest, kneebreeches, allexanderhamilton, publius-esquire, john-laurens, fuck-off-jefferson, hamilton-shitpost, hamiltonshorn, live-love-laurens, radhamilton, and nerdlaurens are sharing quotes, making memes, and shipping pairings. Bloggers are finding emotional connections between their own experiences and the founding fathers’. They’re translating everything into internet-speak, willfully extracting the founders’ words from their 18th-century contexts. And most of all, they’re arguing for hidden queer histories living at the heart of the most sacred era of American politics. Like Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton, the founding-father fandom on Tumblr audaciously takes a history that’s felt staid and old reimagines it as something funny and contemporary and vital.
This is a fandom, with all the creativity, humor, and fervent arguing and agreeing that goes on in all other fandoms. Check out some sample fan art: A group of “Founding Father Pin-Ups” features a truly grotesque Ben Franklin, and an “Ultimate User’s Guide to How to Hug James Madison” advises that the hugger to “withhold from coughing, sneezing, and heavy breathing” and to “plant feet to avoid stepping on” the diminutive founder. Mash-ups proliferate: itsalwayssunnyin1776 inserts founding fathers’ faces into scenes from It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. And text posts imagine moments of … connection between favorite fathers. (Popular “ships,” Tumblrspeak for imagined relationships between objects of a fandom, are “lams” — John Laurens and Alexander Hamilton — and “jamilton” — Jefferson and Hamilton.)
Just because Hamilton features prominently doesn’t mean that the fandom is the fault of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical: Most of its most prominent blogs have existed for years. But it’s certainly expanded since Hamilton started winning every prize and accolade there is to win. Yelyzaveta, or hamiltonshorn, who posts founders-inspired art, told me they started their blog “over a year ago, I’m pretty sure, back when there were only a handful of people and a shoelace to be found in the founding father/history tag that shared my interest.” (That’s a metaphorical shoelace. There was no actual shoelace.) “This was before the Hamilton musical went to Broadway and U.S. history gained so much attention. It was a very tight-knit and cozy little community that I on occasion miss now that it’s become so big.”
When Twitter announced last week that it would changes its “favorites” function to “likes,” and change the corresponding icon from a star to a heart, the service’s power users were alarmed.
At a tech conference in San Francisco today, however, Twitter executive Kevin Weil revealed that the shift seems to be working. With the easier-to-grasp concept of likes, Twitter has seen a 6 percent increase in activity “in just the first week.” Weil added, “The heart is a universal symbol. It’s a much more inclusive symbol.”
The uptick is good news for investors. At the end of last month, Twitter’s shares fell 12 percent on the news of lower-than-expected guidance for the next quarter.
There are some people who think a police officer throwing a female student to the ground, as in that horrifying viral video from South Carolina, is perfectly justifiable! Like some people you are probably Facebook friends with, and like Houston political consultant Angela Box, who argues that the cop in question shouldn’t have been fired. In a “face-off” on Fox’s Houston affiliate with community activist Quanell X, Box starts yelling about how the officer “lost his job for doing his job” and the student was “no innocent little lamb.” Quanell yells right back. The video has hit the top of Reddit’s r/videos section, which means you will see it shared on Facebook several times over the next few days — both by people who agree with Box and by everyone who identifies with X’s anger. There isn’t even a hint of actual dialogue between the combatants, but the clip is the perfect political storm. (Interestingly, Box sued X for defamation earlier this year. Guess they’ve patched things up!)
I am married now, so my average day is spent with my wife. We are practicing sports, listening to music, traveling, doing picnics. Nothing changed about my identity or lifestyle after being famous. I am still living in the same neighborhood, with same friends. But if I wanted — and it is still possible — I could live in the U.S. Hollywood promised me a villa, servants, and limo, but I didn’t want that.
The best part of being famous is that you can give messages to millions of people who love you around the world and orient them toward good things. Also, having many friends from different parts of world — including ladies, of course.
[On Borat] Of course I am mad at him — wouldn’t you be? It’s disrespect, without my permission, earning lots of money. This is stealing. If they had even a little dignity, Borat and the company could apologize to me, but they didn’t even do that. I don’t want to descend to their level. I transferred it to the greatest court and greatest judge, Allah. He will make them pay even if they are not aware.
I’m one of the few where my video directly affected my current career. A lot of other people who go viral have to switch careers, or they never really get to maximize such an event. For me, I was doing something already — working this inspirational-comedian idea, and doing the dance — and then that was like a 20-year boost of marketing and exposure. I was lucky because what I got famous for was something I was already becoming good at.
The most watched video back then was the like Smosh Pokemon Theme Song, and the average age of a YouTuber was about 12 years old. So my video was kind of one of the first that people could related to past the age of 20. And because my video was right when YouTube was becoming popular, a lot of news stations would use it to show what’s on there.
I did a second video, but we don’t talk about that one. I did it right during the big legal turmoil over song rights, when Viacom was suing YouTube, and Sony was suing YouTube. I’d gotten the streaming rights, but it was only for a few songs. In those early days, it was the Wild, Wild West. YouTube didn’t know what to do. Now they have the technology to recognize songs in the videos, and YouTube just distributes the money accordingly. But back then I didn’t want the owner of the rights — and there are 30 songs in that video — to say, “We need you to take that down.” So we had to put it on a different channel. Now that all that’s resolved, the third won’t have those problems.
When my video took off, I got a call from them where it’s like “Hello?” “Hi, please hold for Jeff Zucker, the president of NBC.” I’m like still going, “Huh, what?” when he comes on the line and says, “We’re having this meeting in a couple weeks and I was wondering if you’d be able to come talk to us about internet stuff.” And it was so interesting being in the room — we were listening to the lawyers and their mind-set of “We need to take every person’s content down.” They were suggesting spending millions of dollars on telling people to. And Jeff said, “No, we need to let people just have it. Stop trying to put a finger in the hole when the dam has a thousand others.”
I think the biggest — I don’t really want to say problem, but … [is that] I’ll be turning 40 in March. At most I have maybe just 10 more years of being able to physically do the dance. It’s a taxing thing. The running joke is that I say it’s eventually going to go from being funny to being sad. But I don’t regret anything, not in the slightest. If I could go back and redo anything, it would be that I’d have had a bunch of different merchandise and products to sell. Or maybe do a better job of getting viewers’ emails, so I could just send them a ton of stuff.
I only thought I was getting a job at the local radio station. I knew nothing about viral internet sensations or anything, so when I went down the following day, I saw all types of satellite trucks, news cameras, it was just phenomenal. But I didn’t think any of that was pertaining to me, because when you see CNN, ABC, NBC, all these trucks, you know something’s big. Well, when I walked in that door and all these microphones and cameras were thrust into my face, and just couldn’t believe it. I was an emotional wreck. “Uh, hi, would you like to come on the Today show?” “Hi, this is ABC.” Everybody was fighting for exclusives. It was ridiculous. I mean, who wouldn’t enjoy all this quick adulation? But it became invasive. I was like, “Oh, God, you gotta know my mother? My children? My girlfriend?” We sold my story to NBC for an exclusive, but I’d given out my mother’s address, and CBS This Morning went and found her. Took her away and sequestered her in a hotel in Manhattan so they could have the 17-year reunion of me and my mom. They finally called and said, “Ted, we’re going to take you to see your mother,” and that excited me, but I had no idea there were going to be 35 cameras there.
My platform is simple. First, I want to change the way the power structure deals with homeless military veterans. After all of their years of service, and them protecting the freedoms of Americans, they come back only to become discouraged and disenchanted. They can’t find housing, they can’t find nothing. Secondly, homeless Americans, period—I want to eradicate that. We have more space dedicated to golf courses than we have land appropriated to build housing for homeless Americans. I think we need to shut down some of those country clubs and use that land for helping the homeless. Then I want to definitely challenge states’ handling of Fair Housing laws. And I’m tired of them outsourcing our jobs. We’ve got sweatshops in Thailand, China—you name it, you’ve got little kids manufacturing name-brand things there. Nike! I’m not bashing Nike, don’t get me wrong, but bring those jobs back to America.
Internet fame comes on like an earthquake, with little warning. In a matter of hours, a video can go viral and be viewed 50 million times. Then it (usually) recedes into a very long, thin afterlife. Here, nine YouTube sensations whose lives were upended briefly in the past decade (plus one from the prehistoric web era, before YouTube made its debut in 2005) speak about this odd, relatively new kind of fame. Most embraced the experience, seeing where it would take them. Some ended up in dark places. A couple have made it their living and found themselves with new careers. Others stepped away, opting out of the flame wars. Pay attention: Someday, the accidental celebrity could be you.
Peterson: Kevin put it online because we had a few family and friends who couldn’t make it to the wedding, and he emailed it to the wedding party and our parents — that was it. When we woke up the next morning, it had 100,000 views, and within a few days it was up to a million. I didn’t even know what a viral video was. We got asked to start doing dances at celebrity weddings. The offers rolling in were so intense. Some gossip magazine knocked on Kevin’s grandmother’s door.
We rode it for a few days. But then we sort of hit this point where we had to make a decision — we either need to get on this internet-sensation train, or turn off our cell phones and hide in the basement. So that’s what we ended up doing. We really turned off our phones and sent an email to family and friends, who were getting hounded also, that said “We’re going to try to shut this down collectively.” Like “One, two, three, don’t answer the phone.” For the most part I think we’re happy with that decision.
We used the Chris Brown song, which we were uncomfortable with after it went viral. It was a few months after the Rihanna incident. Because we used his song without permission, all of the money from the video goes to Sony Records — and him, basically. They put a copyright infringement on us, but decided to leave the video up, which shot that song up into the top ten even though it was like two years old. So not only did we use a Chris Brown song, but we were making him money. There’s a TED Talk on it, weirdly—an executive at YouTube talks about the whole process and their relationship with Sony.
We did put up a website, and money still trickles in [for the Sheila Wellstone Institute, an anti-domestic-violence activist group] — every time we think about taking the website down, we realize that we still get donations all these years later, which is really neat. I think we’re past $60,000 or so now.
Harry: [Without the video] I probably wouldn’t be going to the school I go to.
Howard (their dad): All four boys go to a nice school, which we pay for. What the video has done for us is redefine normal. Coming home from school and having an interview on Skype is normal.
Harry: We go to America sometimes; we go to London.
Howard: We view everything with YouTube as a hobby. Life comes first, but one weekend we might be filming a commercial. People know about you when you meet them —
Charlie: That’s scary. Howard: So if someone who’s seen one of those comes up and says, “I saw you skiing,” that must feel a little strange.
Charlie: Yeah. It feels like they’re spying.
Howard: Ha — is that really what you mean? They’re intruding on your life?
Charlie: Yeah.
Howard: Okay. We’ve never had this discussion before. You know, there’s a set of people who take it as a badge of honor to get bitten by Charlie.
Charlie: And then they scream!
Howard: We have an unwritten rule. If someone asks to be bitten, Charlie gets to bite however hard he wants to.
I was in graduate school and working toward my Ph.D. I thought I’d be a history professor. But I’m not passionate about “teaching” or “research” as it thrives in that environment. I’d rather make history than teach it.
Pretend that every week, you print out a new batch of updated business cards. Fame is like walking into a room where many strangers have one or two of your old business cards in their pocket. Many people recognize me from the viral song “Chocolate Rain,” or from Tosh.0, or from America’s Got Talent, or from singing “Mr. Grinch,” or from being parodied on South Park, or from casting video games on Twitch. Some people just know I’m “that guy from the Internet,” or that they’ve heard my voice somewhere. Several times per year, a stranger asks whether I did “Purple Rain.” I correct them. These touchstones — correct and incorrect — are all like old business cards. I’m never sure which ones a stranger carries. In 2007, the internet had the Rodney Dangerfield problem in traditional entertainment—no respect at all. I could go to major talent agencies and say, “Hey! I get great numbers online!” They’d reply with “So?” In 2015, internet influence is an accepted fetish. No hyperbole can describe the way every person and brand is frantically inflating social-media metrics as a form of “digital plastic surgery.” We all want to be influencers. Every facet of our self­actualization is enhanced by appearing to be the biggest digital Pied Piper. Digital influence is now the costume of our century and a problematic eugenics for sorting human value.
I have become more popular on platforms with very little user-regulation — like YouTube in 2007, Twitch today, and even Reddit and 4Chan — than on platforms with very high user-regulation — like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter today. There is more “trolling” on platforms with less user control. User­anonymity may enable some abuse and victimization. However, I also hypothesize that countercultural modes of popularity take off more easily when there’s consumer anonymity. Mutatis mutandis, established modes of popularity take off more easily when there’s less consumer anonymity. It is hard to create Derrida’s fracture in the repetition of power structures when the loins of civil society log every person’s digital utterance. It’s no coincidence that entertainment from Keeping Up With the Kardashians to Grand Theft Auto fulfills our fantasies of acting without social consequence.
[Have you talked to anyone else who inspired a meme?] You act like there’s a halfway house where me, Keenan Cahill, Gary Brolsma, and Rebecca Black take turns mentoring the current month’s memes. I meet these people in passing. There isn’t an epiphany of kinship like All Quiet on the Western Front. Perhaps it’s not quiet enough on the digital front.
I’m a natural showman? Thanks. But it’s easy to get the world to say that. It’s not easy to get a casting director to say that. Nor is it easy to draw a line from surface likability to popularity. Lets be honest — in the era of reality TV and its transition to social-media fan bases … the most popular “showmen” are normal people who fall apart spectacularly, sometimes on cue. Maybe I haven’t found the right show.
I had been doing videos on MySpace a whole year, and “Leave Britney Alone” was really the first time that I spoke about pop culture. People couldn’t get how I would do these skits where I was acting and doing comedy, but then have this one video where, yes, I did mean “leave Britney alone.” It was easier to just play to their perception, and I ran with this idea that I’m a lunatic who cries over celebrities. I thought I would get a chance later to expand on who I really was.
There weren’t many viral videos yet, and I encountered cyberbullying before I was aware what it is. At 19, I couldn’t handle it, and it kind of caused an identity crisis. That wasn’t the way I wanted to be introduced to the world. But in the moment, I just thought, Okay, I have to run with this, as my ticket out of Tennessee. Because no one’s going to take time to learn the backstory, like how my mom was on meth that same year. Which is ultimately why I ended up deleting my YouTube. Now I just use Facebook. On YouTube, with the anonymity, I would log in and be like, “Hey guys, here’s an update,” and the response would always be “Go kill yourself.” On Facebook, I feel comfortable, because people have to actually log in, and you can ban them.
I had this cushy job in Rochester — I quit and moved here, and then three months later my life changed. For that particular press conference, because it was an emergency, I wanted the deaf community to see the urgency. So, yes, Bloomberg may have had a flat affect, but the content of what he was explaining was very serious, and if I didn’t show that, they wouldn’t have taken it seriously.
Originally, I did want to run and hide. It was too much attention for me. I mean, is it cool to be spoofed on Saturday Night Live? Of course. But a lot of different late-night talk shows were spoofing me, and it felt like they were mocking the language. The Chelsea Lately one — she was doing something with her breasts — was just disgusting. But Cecily Strong actually did real sign language. So that felt like respect.
That spotlight helped jump-start my career here, and I thought it was a pivotal point to advocate for the deaf community. Prior to Sandy, New York City didn’t have sign-language interpreters for press conferences. Now several states provide them. It’s so rad that that’s what happened. Closed-captioning isn’t always enough.
I lost a lot of close friends over it — people I’d been friends with since I was 10, people I grew up playing soccer with. One group of girls took me to this party at the University of South Carolina, and I walk in, and the entire USC baseball team surrounded me and bashed me with the harshest, meanest comments I had ever heard. And somebody once put a letter in my parents’ mailbox about how my body was going to be eaten alive by ants and burned in a freak fire. And then it said, in all caps, GO DIE CAITE UPTON, GO DIE FOR YOUR STUPIDITY. That’s the kind of stuff people would say to me for two years.
David Sr.: I was looking at Reddit a while ago, and I saw a video about a dad who was showing his daughter how to chop wood. I was like, Wow, that’s really cool. It’s a daughter and a dad, really kind of folksy and down to Earth. So I made a comment on YouTube, and I identified myself. I said, “Hey, ‘David After Dentist’ dad here. Loved the video. Your relationship with your dad is great — kudos. Good luck.” And the trolls just latched onto me, and just eviscerated me. You know: “You’re just trying to hijack this guy’s thing.”
But that daughter and dad saw my comment, and I spent an hour on the phone with them, just trying to help them navigate the media frenzy that they’re going through. It’s overwhelming. You don’t know what you’re supposed to do, and if there’s money involved, you don’t want them to miss an opportunity. So I kind of walked them through it, and they were just so appreciative. They aren’t the first ones who have reached out over the years for help.
I don’t regret doing it. I will say that moving forward, as David gets older and this thing continues to follow us, it does give me pause to think about when we should just turn all of this over to him, because he’s going to be an adult. And how are we going to navigate that? You know, he’s a teenager now, so he’s very sensitive to attention to himself — he’s a little bit shy. Though there are times where, if it’s a celebrity and they want to engage with him — especially if it were Tim Tebow or somebody like that — I think he would want to pull out the card.

I definitely went through a period where I was very, very depressed. But I never let anybody see that stuff, except for people I could trust. I had some very dark moments where I thought about committing suicide. The fact that I have such an amazing family and friends, it really, really helped. [Begins to tear up] Sorry, it’s just really emotional. This is the first time I’ve actually been able to talk about it. It was awful, and it was every single day for a good two years. I’ve only spoken to my fiancé about how I felt in those moments truthfully, and my best friend. And, recently, my mom. But, like, my dad doesn’t even know yet.
The past few years, going brunette, I have not had any recognition for the Miss Teen USA Pageant at all. But I also get recognized for having a similar name to Kate Upton. So I’ll go into my auditions and be like, “Yes, yes, I know — I’m the other one.”
Imagine applying the same concept to a drone, however; maybe a drone controlled by a hashtag or something. That would be chaos. Imagine watching the VMAs in 2037 and Justin Bieber’s hologram says, “Tweet #VMADrone and then a direction and the drone will go that way,” and the drone collides with an adult North West riding a hoverboard? Jeez louise.
In the middle of 2014, Twitter filed a patent application, No. 20150362917, for a “messaging-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle.” Published last week, the application credits Ya-Ting Wang and Wayne Robins with inventing the device, which sounds like definitely a good idea and not at all like a bad idea that could lead to grievous injury.
Here’s part of the patent’s abstract, describing the drone:
A central idea here is that this sort of thing would be cool at live events, giving social-media users control over their viewing perspective. As the application states:
Followers of an event may also have access to an officially distributed feed of the event through a television, radio, or Internet stream of an event that provides more access or structure. However, these too can be lacking from a social media perspective as resource and cost constraints prevent wider coverage so that even an officially distributed feed lacks the multifaceted perspective that social media provides.
One example is “different selectable options [which] correspond to different celebrities at an awards show. If the goal for the UAV is a camera subject rather than a UAV position, then the pilot directs the UAV to capture the subject from multiple perspectives and to track the subject if the subject moves.”
Controlling a drone via tweets is exactly the kind of tight drone-piloting that people love. And sure, one person in charge of one drone would probably be fine.
Here is another terrifying, hypothetical scenario, though: many people controlling one drone. Consider the social experiment that was Twitch Plays Pokémon, in which thousands of users issued commands to a single game of Pokémon via a chat room. Completing the game required more than 16 days and 122 million chat messages. It was a wonderful mess.
Just before pwning his n00b opponents in tonight’s debate, Ben Carson is demonstrating his mastery of Facebook meme-creation with a series of … not entirely unfunny images making fun of the media. The candidate has been subjected to enhanced scrutiny in the past week over claims that he embellished parts of his rags-to-riches story.
The stunt appears to be working. What better way to show your support of Ben Carson and his strained relationship with fact than with a highly shareable image exactly calibrated to Minions-meme levels of humor. This post, less than an hour old, already has 8,500 shares.
This one is performing even better, with more than 25,000 people rebroadcasting Carson’s jab.
To be honest, this goof-up is rude as hell.
Trump’s astronomically high self-assuredness means that he almost never deletes tweets, even when they might conflict with his own current phraseology or that of the Republican Establishment. Three years ago, he wrote:
It’s tough to imagine any of the other GOP candidates ever sending a tweet like this.
I highly recommend searching Trump’s feed for insults like “loser” and “hater.” This man wants to (and could!) be president of these United States, and here he is, getting into caps-lock-fueled flame wars with Twitter Eggs.
One of the most infamous Trump tweets concerned 9/11. He’s deleted the original, but it still lives on in a self-retweet. Somehow, it’s even more poetic this way.
As more and more of the globe comes online, a new breed of warfare is emerging, and the specter of a devastating act of cyberterrorism looms large over noble America. Donald, care to weigh in?
And speaking of brilliant nerds …
Last night, in the Iowa caucus, Donald Trump — a solid-gold winner who pisses victory and farts success — placed second. And as Walter Hagen reputedly said, no one remembers who came in second.
Weirder threads do arise when diving into the Trump archives. For instance, a few years ago, the Donald had a lot to say about Robert Pattinson’s relationship with Kristen Stewart, who cheated on Pattinson while they were dating.
When trying to put their fingers on the source of Trump’s seemingly improbable success, pundits have circled around this unpredictable self-assurance: the confidence to stand on a stage and say whatever is running through his mind. This is a horrifying quality in a presidential candidate, but reading Trump’s tweets, the appeal becomes apparent to me.
It’s not that his tweet are necessarily "authentic" — public posturing rarely is — but that their existence, in aggregate online, is something of an anomaly. In a world where an immensely famous rap star is afraid enough of public misinterpretation to erase an attention-getting fight (having already erased years’ worth of tweets about anime on YouTube), and where job applicants are constantly told to comb their social media profiles for potentially incriminating posts, it’s oddly encouraging to encounter a public figure who not only doesn’t worry about his social media history, but actively succeeds in the face of its contradictions. Even if he’s a horrible monster.
Great stuff. It’s all great. Love it. I love Trump’s old tweets, and I hope that they stay around forever, if he wins or loses.
And if, at some point, he does drop out, I know just what to do.
But you don’t need me to tell you that. Twice over the last three years, Trump himself has tweeted that exact quote. Each tweet had only a few hundred interactions before last night; they’ve now been retweeted more than 50,000 times combined, because people love schadenfreude and Trump makes it easy.
Trump’s position as a glad-handing businessman and celebrity before he entered the GOP primary race is unique among presidential candidates, and one of the best ways that this has manifested is in his Twitter account.
Whenever Trump says something ridiculous (so, whenever he opens his mouth) my first impulse — and I suspect many others’ as well — is to go to Twitter and search for the topic. All it takes is “from:realdonaldtrump” in the search bar, and we’re off.
Most career politicians play it safe on Twitter, operating solely in a professional capacity. Amazing moments — like Chuck Grassley killing a deer, or Scott Brown tweeting “Bqhatevwr" — are exceptions to the rule. This makes sense. In an era of near-constant attention on candidates, social media is generally treated as a platform for sharing safe platitudes and straightforward news about the candidate. Why give your opponents more ammunition?
Trump’s feed, on the other hand, is an inadvertent cache of oppositional research: A public, searchable collection of 30,000 (and climbing) quips, comments, and asides from the last half-decade. It’s littered with self-promotion, endorsements from fans, bold proclamations, and soppy inspirational quotes that crusty old dudes love. And, importantly, opinions that should theoretically make him unpalatable to a Republican electorate — the kind of stuff campaign workers would usually have to dig around for, unearthed by an old college roommate or from a dusty filing cabinet.
Look, if you’re going to make a pizza, you’re going to want a perfect three-cheese blend. And if you think that’s as simple as picking out three cheeses and blending them, buddy … well, it is. But experienced Tucson-based personal chef Mike Neylan made this instructional video anyway, just to ensure that nothing goes wrong. Very kind of him.
To be fair to chef Mike, this video was part of an entire series on making pizza, created in 2012 for archetypal content farm eHow. There was a time in the not-so-distant past, before the ascension of Facebook was complete, when websites like this would divide their content into the smallest possible chunks in order to jockey for search-engine traffic. Is anyone searching “how to make a three-cheese blend” instead of “how to make a three-cheese pizza”? Probably not, but if they do, content farms want those clicks.
Is chef Mike capable of making a single video covering all of the pizza basics, including how to mix three shredded cheeses in a bowl and how to cut a pizza with scissors? Certainly. He’s been a personal chef for more than 20 years. But you’re thinking like a human — in the content-farm era, the key was to think like a machine.
And so the cheese video stands alone, a perfect, crystalline artifact of its time.
Ironically, the plan worked, but not thanks to search engines. The video has been seen 500,000 times after getting popular on Reddit’s /r/videos, where it was mocked mercilessly. Turns out this cheesy nugget of content was built for humans after all, whether the publisher intended it or not. Can you imagine a complete, useful, non-absurd pizza video achieving such popularity?
Chef Mike didn’t respond to an email requesting comment about his days as a video pizza instructor.
Twitter has a much-deserved reputation for being a hellworld of trolls, idiots, bad-faith arguments, and ad hominem attacks. But every once in a while, it can still deliver. Like when a college professor, an essayist, and a TV showrunner debate each other about journalism late at night. Last night, Wire creator David Simon decided to pick a fight with Roxane Gay, the author of Bad Feminist, and Tressie Cottom, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University (and one of the sharpest people on Twitter). What came out of it was exactly the kind of thing you might hope to find on a social network like Twitter: A good debate.
“Good” is relative, obviously; sadly, we also got what you’d expect out of Twitter — Cottom and Gay’s mentions are now filled with much less capable men than Simon attempting debate. But last night’s conversation, which essentially doubled Simon’s output on the social network, is worth preserving, no matter who you think won. Here’s a Storify:
Instagram announced today that it will increase the time limit on videos uploaded to the service — quadrupling the length from 15 seconds to 60. That’s a lot of brunch.
Previously, Instagram’s 15-second videos were akin to Vines, short and sweet (though Instagram added looping functionality later on). It’s not a surprise to see that many of the creators featured in the company’s announcement video also have popular Vine accounts. The longer limit, however, sets Instagram’s eyes on a bigger prize: YouTube, which is still dominant in the online-video landscape. To that end, Instagram is also re-implementing the ability to upload multiple clips from iOS into a single video, meaning that users now have a primitive method for editing clips together.
The new maximum is rolling out today and over the coming months, the company said. The move comes as many of the web’s major platforms, including Instagram’s parent company, Facebook, make a concerted effort to emphasize video. “In the last six months, the time people spent watching video increased by more than 40 percent. And longer videos mean more diverse stories from the accounts you love,” according to an Instagram blog post.
The math on this is pretty simple: The longer the video, the longer the amount of time people spend watching it, the more ads they can sell. Not coincidentally, advertisers on Instagram have had the ability to post 60-second videos for a while. They’ve also had access to multi-image carousels, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see Instagram roll those out relatively soon as well.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Haughey has also received threats from gun owners who would like to, let’s say, demonstrate how good their aim is.
You might be asking yourself, “Hey, what sort of content is hosted on the Tumblr blog #GOPdildo?” It’s not a very complex answer: It is photos of conservative politicians holding guns, except that the guns have been Photoshopped out and replaced with dildos, which are a type of sex toy.
Here’s former Texas governor Rick Perry, for instance.
The blog came about as a uniquely internetty way of advocating for some kind of legislative action to curtail gun violence. Over on Medium, Metafilter founder Matt Haughey explained how and why he has embarked on this journey.
The rules of #GOPdildo are simple: Take photos of conservative lawmakers and power brokers wielding guns — and they must be guns — and replace the weapons with rubber penises. With each post, include a link to both the original photo, and the dildo’s Amazon listing.
“In one week, I’m already up to 32 completed images and I have a downloads directory with dozens more,” Haughey wrote. “I joked that maybe I’d hit 500 images someday, but now I’m starting to think that’s actually possible, and that’s a frightening observation about gun culture in the US.”

Although wildlife experts don’t recommend keeping tanuki as pets — as they’ve moved into urban areas and started eating cats’ food, they’ve also picked up an unfortunate outbreak of mange — Tanu seems to be a rare success story.
@chibi_tori tells BuzzFeed he found Tanu abandoned last June and has been raising him as a pet. During the winter, the little guy mainly just wants to sleep inside next to a warm stove.
The tanuki, a Japanese species sometimes called a “raccoon dog,” is perhaps best known in the West — if it’s known at all — for appearing in a classic Mario game and being a trickster god with giant testicles (there’s an entire Tom Robbins novel based on this legend). But, as the internet is finding out today, tanuki are real, and they’re spectacularly cute. Photos of a tanuki named Tanu playing in the snow have been making the rounds since Tanu’s owner, @chibi_tori, posted them early this morning. After a write-up on BuzzFeed, tanuki made the list of trending topics, and now the whole world is mad for the cute raccoon-thing with the giant balls. And why not? Look at him.
Look.

Tech companies, including Google parent Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon have announced intentions to file a joint amicus brief in support of Apple in its fight with the FBI and Department of Justice over whether it can be forced to unlock the phone of Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino terrorists, The Wall Street Journal and others report. CEOs from some of the companies, including Google’s Sundar Pichai and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, have vocally supported Apple in recent weeks. An unnamed source told Re/code, “The industry is aligned and working on a joint submission to the court.”
This comes hours after Apple filed to dismiss the court order calling for them to work with the FBI, saying, “This is not a case about one isolated iPhone … Rather, this case is about the Department of Justice and the FBI seeking through the courts a dangerous power that Congress and the American people have withheld: the ability to force companies like Apple to undermine the basic security and privacy interests of hundreds of millions of individuals around the globe.” The District Court of Central California gave the government until March 10 to respond. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with ABC News that he would be prepared to take this case to the Supreme Court.
Yesterday, the New York Times reported that Apple is working on beefing up the security systems in iPhones even more to make it even harder than it already is for governments to break into them. The Department of Justice is currently involved in at least a dozen other cases trying to force Apple to break into iPhones using the same 18th-century law.
Facebook released statistics today on government requests during the first half of 2015. And guess what? Governments are asking a lot more out of Facebook. In a blog post written by Chris Sonderby, the company’s deputy general counsel, the company laid out the significant increase in government inquiry and content restrictions across the globe.
In the U.S. alone, law enforcement made 17,577 requests on nearly 27,000 user accounts. For comparison, the same period a year ago netted 15,433 requests. In nearly 80 percent of 2015 cases, some data was produced. More than half of the requests pertained to search warrants.
In terms of national security, the company received between 0 and 999 National Security Letters. (Federal law only permits the disclosure of NSL receipts in increments of 1,000.)
Indie game designer Eddie Lee found a very strange request in his inbox Tuesday night: Could he please take down some code he’d posted five years ago? It’s not that there was any problem with the code, it was just that the emailer had copied it for a class project and didn’t want his teacher to find out. The work in question was a particle system based on the Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics equations, which are typically used in modeling things like ocean currents and weather systems. Lee demonstrated his code with a video applying wind forces to 40,000 different particles. It was impressive enough that one student decided to copy it verbatim, and claim it as his own. But after turning the project in, he started to have second thoughts (or fears that he might get in trouble). So he sent Lee a desperate email — not to apologize, but to beg Lee to help him with the cover-up. “I loved your Navier Stokes Equations so much that I copied it word for word, variable for variable, and presented it to my teacher for my final semester project,” the code-plagiarist confessed via email. “However, my teacher is a smart man and he had previously caught a guy who copied code from the Internet. Could you please remove your Navier Stokes Equations program from the site for a week?” As if that wasn’t audacious enough, he ended the request with “thanks in advance.” On Tuesday night, Lee tweeted, “I just got this ridiculous email. What to do?” Not take down the code to help a cheater, obviously. It’s still up as of Wednesday morning. But there are other possibilities, like ratting the kid out to his teacher. Lee hasn’t mentioned on Twitter whether he’s considering that, and he didn’t return a request for comment. Assuming this tale of woe is real, the interesting part is that the student might actually get away with it. Fluid dynamics and particle systems are such an important part of games, and the Navier Stokes equations are such an important concept in fluid dynamics, that Lee’s project doesn’t come up near the top of the Google results. And the code is in a zip file on Lee’s website, not on a searchable hosting service like GitHub, so even searching for snippets from the code itself doesn’t seem to turn it up. But maybe the teacher, “a smart man,” has more sophisticated ways of rooting out plagiarism. Update 12/10: Eddie Lee told us via email that he responded to the student, asking him why he did what he did. The student wrote back, "I borrowed your Navier Stokes Code. I’ll just show it to him tomorrow and I’ll be done with Computer Graphhics. Computer Graphics was never up my alley. I hate it. I plan to pursue an acting career. However if he fails me I’ll have to study CG for another semester." When that didn’t result in Lee taking his code down, the student attempted to trick him again with a fake email from a nonexistent professor. "I penalized a student day before yesterday and I penalized one more today. Later they confessed that they were copying codes from your website," the fake professor wrote, "Could you please remove the code section from your programs lest my students illegally use your codes all over again ?" Lee was not fooled.
“Even if I had found that the two minutes of concern at the Cadillac Lounge amounted to fear for her safety,” he wrote, “I would not find it to be reasonable in all of the circumstances.”
As the first and only criminal case of Twitter harassment in Canada, this says a lot about what it takes for online harassment to rise to the level of crime there: not just harassment, but a judge’s opinion that the harassment is sufficiently threatening to the victim’s personal safety.
Ultimately, this was a case of two competing ideas about how Twitter ought to be used, and the court came down on the side of unrestricted public conversation, finding that there’s a right for anyone to express their opinions, however “garbage” they may be, but no right to force someone to stop bothering you with their garbage opinions in a public forum.
This might be the most fascinating legal passage yet written on the nature of Twitter:
And whether you agree with the ruling or not, it’s breaking new legal ground by even attempting to scratch the surface of the widespread harassment problem Twitter users have been dealing with for years. Twitter’s public nature is both its entire appeal and its biggest weakness, and that’s not a problem that’s up to the legal system to solve. Change will have to come either through the software itself or through a cultural shift — and given how resistant Twitter, Inc., has been to the former, and how resistant Twitter users have been to the latter, it’s hard to hold out much hope.
Canada’s first criminal case involving Twitter harassment, which could set legal precedents around online behavior, ended Friday with a not-guilty verdict for the alleged harasser. Gregory Alan Elliott sent “vulgar and sometimes obscene” tweets to two women in 2012, but a judge dismissed the case after finding that the victims never “reasonably feared for their safety” based on Elliott’s tweets, the CBC reported.
The case began in 2012, when one of Elliott’s accusers, Steph Guthrie, met him through Twitter and considered hiring him to do some graphic-design work. After feeling “creeped out” by their dinner together and looking at his Twitter presence, which is largely concerned with conservative Canadian politics, men’s-rights activism, and sex, she decided not to work with him — at that point, she says, he began to harass her online.
The two got into a heated online argument over a video game that let players punch feminist games-critic Anita Sarkeesian in the face — Guthrie wanted her Twitter followers to go after the creator of the game, while Elliott defended him. Eventually, she blocked him, but she said he kept indirectly communicating with her by using feminist hashtags she’d created and that he knew she would check.
Various sites reported that Elliott called Guthrie and the other harassment victim, Heather Reilly, “fascist feminists,” but the CBC notes police didn’t preserve the vulgar, obscene tweets he’s accused of sending. The lack of evidence played a role in Elliott’s case being dismissed, after his lawyers argued that the judge couldn’t fairly evaluate the case without seeing the tweets in question, and that it would be impossible to prove Elliott was the one who actually sent them.
Still, this ruling sets a high bar for what’s considered criminal online harassment. It’s not enough that Guthrie repeatedly indicated she wanted Elliott to stop contacting her, and eventually blocked him. Nor is it enough that Elliott once tweeted about a particular bar while Heather Reilly was there with her friends, which she said caused her to fear for her safety.
Although the judge, Justice Brent Knazan, acknowledged harassment had taken place, he said the harassment came through the sheer number of tweets Elliott sent to the women, not through specific threats. And without those threats, there’s no criminal offense.
“There is no doubt that Ms. Guthrie was harassed and that Mr. Elliott must know that now, after her complaint and her testimony,” he wrote. “But even now, what has harassed her is only the volume of tweets. There is no allegation of sexual harassment or threats, as Ms. Guthrie and Crown counsel acknowledge.”
And even if the women did fear for their safety, Knazan wrote, he didn’t find it reasonable for them to do so, even in the one instance when Elliott indicated he knew Reilly’s location:
It is 2016 and though we don’t have hovercars yet, we do apparently have the privilege of getting our cars hacked. The FBI, the Department of Transportation, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have put out a new PSA warning drivers that cars are “increasingly vulnerable to remote exploits.”
It reads in part:
If there is one part that sticks out, it’s that last sentence, asking drivers “to maintain awareness of potential issues and cybersecurity threats” in their cars. This is where we’re headed. A few years ago, cybersecurity was the domain of experts, and only really applied to your PC, maybe your phone, too. As every piece of technology starts to go online, and talk to other pieces of technology (eg., your fridge, soon), you’re going to have to worry about the security of all of it.
The fun thing about cybersecurity is that one weak link in the chain can collapse the whole entire structure. And now your car is part of it.
It’s cool, they thought, that Hotson built this thing using pixi.js, and that he’d made a webGL application that didn’t crash or set their CPUs on fire. And that depth map he made in Illustrator to make the cat look 3-D — also impressive. (And terrifying: One poster compared it to seeing the cat’s “soul.”)
But wasn’t it inefficient to get the music from YouTube? He could have saved 7.8 MB of bandwidth if he’d used an mp3! And why didn’t the cat shoot lasers? They expected lasers!
There are no lasers. There’s a cat, and there are pickles. It’s pretty good.
Happy Monday. How was your Thanksgiving? Ah, forget it — Pickle Cat is here.
Pickle Cat is a technology demo by Australian developer Dennis Hotson. More to the point, it’s an animation of a cat in space, gaping in bug-eyed wonder as pickles float past. It was inspired by a classic GIF by TJ Fuller, depicting a different space-cat blasting away cucumbers with its laser eyes:
The bouncy synth soundtrack for Pickle Cat was pulled from YouTube. It’s by a band called Lazerhawk.
A series of viral videos that spread earlier this year revealed that cats panic and run upon seeing cucumbers — it’s said the long green objects look enough like snakes to trigger a cat’s flight instincts. Is Pickle Cat scared? Probably.
Most people would say these are the salient facts about Pickle Cat. But on Hacker News, a technology website for serious people where Pickle Cat was briefly the No. 1 topic of the weekend, the discussion had little to do with cats or with pickles.
Instead, it was about the software behind the cat.
And with that, “You ain’t no Muslim, bruv” has served its purpose and has been officially retired.
Police subdued a man with a knife in an East London tube station Saturday night, stopping what was allegedly a terrorist attack. Of course there’s concern about the attacker’s identity and his possible motivation, but the part of the incident the internet has seized on came after the man was already tasered and subdued on the ground: An onlooker shouted “You ain’t no Muslim, bruv!”
Coming on the same weekend that U.S. president Barack Obama delivered another speech urging his audience not to blindly conflate “Muslim” and “terrorist,” the bystander’s condemnation of the man with the knife has become kind of a catchphrase for our terror-filled times. #YouAintNoMuslimBruv trended on Twitter as video of the incident started to spread, and most agreed it was the most stereotypically “London” response to an attack that they could think of:
The pithy phrase even made its way up to British prime minister David Cameron, who used it in an address on Sunday, much to the public’s amusement.
Cameron praised the man who coined the phrase, saying, “Some of us have dedicated speeches and media appearances, and soundbites and everything to this subject but ‘you ain’t no Muslim, bruv’ said it all, much better than I ever could and thank you, because that will be applauded all around the country.”
A fair point, but the meaning of Cameron’s words was secondary to the awkwardness of the Eton-educated conservative prime minister putting on his best working-class-London voice and saying “bruv.” Look at the way he punctuates each word with his fist. It couldn’t be more perfect.
Twitch Plays Pokemon (still going!) saw millions of internet users crowdsource an entire video game, kicking off a mini-genre. Its latest iteration is Tamagotwitch, in which a noisy chat room tries to take care of a baby Tamagotchi.
It’s less action-packed even than Pokemon — there are only three buttons to choose from, determined by commenters typing A, B, or C, and votes are tallied every few seconds. But life and death is at stake! Remember how hard it was in elementary school to remember when to feed or clean up after your digital pet, leaving it surrounded by stinky piles of poop? It’s kind of like that, but with thousands of people trying to manage it at once.
The Twitch’s robotic arm swings back and forth, tapping buttons with a sinister noise, but so far the chat room isn’t getting very far. (“Yes smack that,” one commenter commanded.) That might be because the Tamagotchi is actually really confusing. The screen is so small that it’s hard to see quite what the buttons do. Also, the Tamagotchi heyday is long gone, and we’ve lost our digital maternal instincts.
I’m pretty sure the current Tamagotchi and many, many subsequent generations are completely doomed. The little food icons still look weirdly delicious, though.
There are a bunch of new features.While individual users have had the ability to broadcast for a while, Facebook is rolling out other features today. Groups and events can now livestream, so get ready to receive alerts for all of the cool parties you’re missing out on.
You can also replay comments as they occurred during the live broadcast, though why on Earth you would want to is beyond me, since live comments on small-audience videos are mundane, and on high-audience videos like stepping into a football-stadium bathroom during halftime. Still, Facebook says people comment ten times more during live videos.
Finally, there are some new filters users can overlay video with — most likely the first step to incorporating the face-swap and other features from the recently purchased virtual face-mask app MSQRD as well.
Facebook is trying to make the News Feed relevant again.In a February meeting, according to BuzzFeed, Zuckerberg informed the company that it was putting an unusually large amount of muscle behind live video — a scaling-up that required more than 150 engineers. In his words, the format is “a new, raw way that people wanted to share on a day-to-day basis. We’re seeing this especially with young people and teens.”
At its heart, Facebook’s live push is about those young people and teens. As much as the company wants to seem like a leader, it’s following in the footsteps of other platforms, like Snapchat and Twitch, that are enormously popular with the under-25 crowd. Snapchat’s Stories are quasi-live videos that get tons of attention, and Facebook is attempting to capture that same feeling of spontaneity. Twitch is quietly expanding from video games into other livestreaming areas, with sections for drawing and creativity as well. And the Twitter-owned Periscope is … uh, still around, too. Facebook — by which we mean the News Feed, in particular — has a reputation as staid or boring. It’s still Facebook’s biggest moneymaker, but it doesn’t get as much awe-inspired press as other Facebook properties, like WhatsApp, Oculus, or even Instagram. Giving the platform Snapchat-like capabilities is an effort to inject it with a little bit of excitement. And also, I guess, to give BuzzFeed a place to further torture its employees.
Today, Facebook announced a bunch of new tools for Facebook Live, its growing live-video platform. This is not, in and of itself, particularly interesting: Tech companies make announcements about new products and features all the time. But Facebook isn’t just any old tech company, and when it tells the world about a cool new feature, it’s also unofficially telling you a new and soon-fundamental way in which you will experience the internet at large. That’s how much power it wields. Fun!
So, as we enter the year of Facebook sending you annoying notifications that someone or something you follow is broadcasting live, here’s what you should know.
You’re going to see a lot of live video this year.Facebook is actively pushing live video. It’s reportedly paying media brands like BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post money to create live video, and its mobile app has added a dedicated video tab for you to find all of your live streaming all in one place. At the start of last month, the company announced it would start weighing live broadcasts more heavily in users’ News Feeds, meaning you’ll see more of them whether you want to or not, right at the top of your feed when you sign in.
This is the approximately one-billionth time Facebook is forcing a new feature on users, who will be annoyed for a split second and then wonder how they lived without it.
That doesn’t mean any of the live video will be good.Obviously, your friends will make a lot of dumb live videos. (Maybe they already are.) Worse, publishers, thirsty for attention and users, can’t ignore anything that Facebook is prioritizing in this way, even if they don’t really understand what to do with it. So you’re going to see — and be notified about! — a lot of weird and bad video while all of your favorite brands figure out how to leverage Facebook’s new thing.
Turning off live notifications is hard.Facebook is literally sending push notifications to users whenever Pages they like go live. The practice is annoying to many, but apparently it’s working. The company is apparently working on a way to turn off all of the notifications at once, but it has yet to materialize. On mobile, swiping right on notifications will reveal a “More” menu that lets you disable per-user alerts. On desktop, just click the “X” icon next to the notification.
On the other hand, making Live video is pretty easy.Open up the Facebook app on your phone, click the field where you’d write a status, and select “Live Video.” From there, you just need to press a button.
No one is demanding that Jeb Bush do both, and the idea that he — the consummate Establishment white guy — would even try is inherently absurd.
Steve Harvey is extremely wack, and has made a second career out of telling other people — especially women — how to act. Physician, heal thyself.
President Barack Obama can kinda-sorta “do both.” Like Drake, his response to the impossible demands of simultaneous class and swag is to be an unapologetic, and therefore cool, dork. It seems to have worked out for him, electorally speaking!
It’s funny because Bill Nye the Science Guy, a famous white person, is not expected to be swaggy.
The best new meme of this week features side-by-side photos of Drake — one where he’s dressed in a slick jacket and tie, the other in warm-ups and a Michael Jordan ball cap. “Get you a man who can do both,” reads the caption. It says a lot about the perceived dichotomy between “class” and “swag,” especially for black men, and how Drake carefully navigates it. But it also inspired a number of parodies that are really, really funny.
It’s funny because Guy Fieri, a famous white person, is not expected to be either classy or swaggy. He’s merely expected to be a rich natural source of frosted tips, irrational excitement, and fryer grease.
James Corden, a British person, is automatically considered classy by American audiences due to his accent. He is not expected to have swag, and, in fact, may be disallowed from possessing it by the U.S. Constitution.
This is an excellent meme that reveals a lot about what we ask of our celebrities and, by extension, ourselves. At the same time, it’s also truly hilarious. Get you a meme that can do both.
The idea that “class” and “swag” are polar opposites, and especially that the former is more desirable than the latter, has been part of meme culture for some time.
“Swag is for boys, class is for men,” goes one popular image.
According to internet stereotypes, class and swag cannot exist in one person at the same time — and that’s what makes Drake, and the “man who can do both” meme, so fascinating.
Drake’s popularity is very much built on being all things to all people — he’s black and Jewish; he reps Toronto, but also Houston and Atlanta; he raps, but also sings; he makes music for his dudes, but also for his ladies. Drake acts hard or soft, depending on the situation and the target audience. It’s an infuriating double standard, but Drake somehow lives it: He’s the poster boy for “do both.”
So that infamous tweet from @_mikeshotya — now retweeted tens of thousands of times — appealed to the large and vocal Drake-stan segment of Twitter, but it also appealed to people who wanted to mock the inherent hypocrisy of a class-swag binary.
A controversy has fired up the fighting-game community this week, after a Street Fighter exhibition match in which rapper Lupe Fiasco defeated pro player Daigo Umehara. Did the champ throw the match? Is Lupe actually that good? Let’s enter the world of Street Fighter conspiracy.
Last month, Fiasco, who is vocal about his Street Fighter fandom but is nonetheless an amateur, consented to an exhibition match, tweeting, “It would be an honor to lose to Daigo-San.” In Fiasco’s own words, going up against Daigo is like going up against Michael Jordan one-on-one, so the odds were stacked against him. Yet somehow, Fiasco managed to pull off a win in a nail-biter best-of-five match that went all the way to the final round.
If Fiasco going the distance against a pro sounds suspect to you, you’re not alone. The match took place yesterday at the launch gala for the new Street Fighter V and was organized by Mad Catz, a company that makes controllers for fighting games. Almost immediately, FGC members began to speculate that the match was rigged to help sell the game and accessories. As one member of NeoGAF wrote, “People thinking that was legit gives me a new understanding to how people could believe in creationism.”
Some discussed the match in pro-wrestling terms: “Daigo setting up Lupe’s comeback in the last round. Perfect psychology by Daigo good work rate and execution.”
Mad Catz told Kotaku that the fight was not rigged, but fans are speculating that because of the casual nature and low stakes of the exhibition match, Daigo went easy or played loosely. As one GAF member explained:
As of this morning, Lupe now ranks first on Shoryuken.com, a leading Street Fighter site for competitive players.
Two weeks ago, Angela Ramey made a very impressive basketball shot.
Ramey’s daughter, Grace, had raised the most money for a fund-raiser at Bethany Academy in Minnesota, and as a reward, she was offered a chance at half off tuition for the next year (which is a savings somewhere in the ballpark of $5,000).
To earn it, she would have to make a half-court shot. Both Angela and Grace made attempts, and on the third and final try, Angela got lucky. In fact, she didn’t even see the shot go in. It was a very lucky bounce.
“I looked at the ball. I looked at the ground. I dribbled once. I closed my eyes and I said a quick prayer,” Ramey told a local news station.
And then all of the kids started screaming, and everyone started celebrating. It is a very nice thing to see! There’s a lot of bad stuff happening right now, but this video is good. Please enjoy it.
Is Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz the infamous Zodiac Killer? Well, no. But don’t tell that to the nearly 40 percent of Florida voters who say they believe it’s within the realm of possibility that Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer. In a poll released by liberal polling firm Public Policy Polling today, 10 percent of respondents said they believed for certain that Cruz is responsible for at least five and up to 28 murders in the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1960s and ’70s, while 28 percent said they were unsure but couldn’t rule it out.
Every day Cruz, a Canadian senator from Texas, doesn’t respond to these allegations is a day his campaign falls into deeper trouble. As he struggles in the polls against Donald Trump, who is beating him by 35 points in Florida, an important swing state, look for more voters to turn against him as he continues to hold out on saying whether or not he is a serial killer. Cruz’s Senate Press Office didn’t return a request for comment.
Obviously, the RIAA has a substantial interest in shaming streaming sites into giving them more money. The organization, notoriously slow to even acknowledge the web as a distribution vector, only recently got over its habit of suing individual music pirates for thousands of dollars. So the statistics, while likely accurate, aren’t being presented by a neutral party. The overall takeaway is that while ad-supported streaming is becoming the norm, it’s not exactly helping artists eke out a living.
Yesterday, the recording industry’s governing body, the RIAA, released its annual report on the state of the industry, looking at data from 2015. The results, they found, were at the same time hopeful and worrying.
On the one hand, the music industry is getting more comfortable with the internet — more than 70 percent of their revenue in 2015 came from digital. Streaming, specifically, now accounts for 34 percent of American music revenue, up from 27 percent in 2014.
But, there’s a catch:
The RIAA’s grievances mainly come from ad-supported free tiers, the most popular of which is currently Spotify. In this area, the growth in the number of listeners has not grown proportionally to the revenue coming back to the music industry. In other words, the RIAA is arguing that tech companies are hoarding most of the ad revenue for themselves, using outdated regulations to avoid compensating labels and musicians. Huh! A tech company using the creative work of others to build up users and collect revenue! Crazy!
This is not really new information. Artists have complained practically since its inception that Spotify does not compensate them fairly. Taylor Swift famously shook them off (get it?) and removed her catalogue from the service for this very reason.
As a way of driving home their point, the RIAA points out that as popular as streaming music is, vinyl record sales still bring in more money — $416 million in 2015 compared to streaming’s $385 million.
On Sunday, Vine star Bryan Silva was arrested by Virginia authorities following a tense standoff that lasted roughly three hours. Around six in the morning, Silva’s teenage girlfriend called the police, claiming that “she was threatened with a firearm.” Silva then apparently barricaded himself inside his Charlottesville home after police arrived with warrants for abduction and firearm possession.
During the standoff Silva posted updates on Facebook, including one video captioned, “Y’all pigs can suck my monster dick.” Another video at the time showed him drinking what appears to be vodka.
Silva was arrested with his pants around his ankles.
Silva, 25, is well-known on Vine — as local CBS affiliate WTVR put it, he has “amassed hundreds of thousands of followers for making gun noises on the video sharing site” — for acting like an all-around clown and showing off a wide array of firearms. He’s a walking argument for gun control.
In 2014, Silva spawned a minor meme when he posted this Vine of himself, shirtless in the bathroom, making threats to nobody in particular. His onomatopoeiac “gratata” quickly gained traction.
But by and large, Gawker’s media peers stand behind it, even as they distance themselves from it. “It was a vile story about vile people,” Slate Group editor-in-chief Jacob Weisberg wrote over email. “I would never defend that kind of gutter journalism. But I worry about the Florida jury verdict setting a precedent that restricts press freedom in favor of a legally undefined privacy right, moving us closer to something like the European right to be forgotten. Also, the size of the award and the requirement to post a ruinous bond in order to appeal are preposterous.”
The media commentator Jeff Jarvis — himself a longtime Gawker target — wrote a Medium post on Friday that summed up this argument succinctly: “Gawker is nothing if not reliably offensive, noxious, and cruel. Nonetheless, it deserves the defense the Bill of Rights affords. […] Like it or not, Gawker deserves the protection of the First Amendment like Nazis in Skokie.”
Over the phone, Jarvis told me he was most worried about the chilling effect the ruling could have on organizations with shallower pockets. “I do worry that others who have newsworthy things to publish may stop themselves out of fear of being destroyed in court. In an age when everyone can be a publisher, not everyone has billions of dollars, and a bankroll to support legal fees.”
Others went further: “Based on what I read about the case, I would have voted against the invasion of privacy charges,” emailed Jack Shafer, the Politico columnist and media critic. “I have no animus against the Gawker squad so hence I am without schadenfreude. Ugly cases sometimes make good law — our protections against prior restraint were established in Near vs. Minnesota, which pitted a totally scurrilous publication against the state — so here’s hoping that the appeal results in a Gawker victory and potentially greater protection to publish.”
“It’s embarrassing to work in media and see people cheering Gawker’s (temporary) loss,” a newspaper reporter said of the site’s thorny reputation. “It’s not the outlets that have mastered sponsored content who need First Amendment protections. It’s the ones that are willing to burn those bridges.”
But ultimately, and tellingly, the handwringing of media-insider Twitter made up only a very small part of the reaction to the verdict online. You only need to check in on the celebration over on the KotakuInAction subreddit, a hub for Gamergate discussion (Kotaku is Gawker Media’s video-game blog) to see where the real action is happening. And Gamergaters — despite their ostensible free-speech commitments — see no real problem celebrating Gawker’s demise.
Milo Yiannopoulos, the Breitbart Tech editor and prominent Gamergate commentator, says that perspective mostly comes from a feeling that Gawker has “abused” free speech. “[A]s a result it’s being punished by readers and punished by the market,” he said. Gamergate’s upholding of free speech “doesn’t mean you can’t take pleasure in seeing them get a bloody nose. I refuse to feel sorry for taking pleasure in this because they had it coming.”
But even Yiannopoulos had to admit that it wasn’t as cleanly cut as he might’ve hoped. “They’re probably going to win on appeal,” he predicted, “and if I’m honest and true to my principles, I’ll probably be happy with that, right? Because I don’t want a legal precedent that makes it more difficult to tell the truth.”
As if the $115-million judgment awarded to Hulk Hogan by a Florida jury on Friday wasn’t bad enough for Gawker, that same jury doled out an additional $25 million in punitive damages on Monday. (One warning sign: On learning that former editor A.J. Daulerio has negative net-worth due to student debt, the jury asked Judge Pamela Campbell if it could award community service instead of monetary damages.) It’s not all bad, though: After the worse-than-worst-case result, Gawker’s friends, enemies, and frenemies in media are standing behind it. Even if they’re holding their noses while doing so.
In fact, if there was a bright spot for Gawker on Friday, it was the sheer size of the award. “The damages were so high that it kinda came out the other side,” one staffer said. In other words, the figure was so insanely high that not even Gawker’s legion of enemies could take comfort in schadenfreude. In terms of the reaction from its media peers, the staffer continued, “something like $10 million would have been much worse.”
It makes sense. Gawker Media itself will likely be fine. The blog network, being sued by wrestler Hulk Hogan over a 2012 post on its flagship site featuring a short excerpt from a sex tape, recently took on outside investment in part to help it weather the expected adverse judgment. So long as the company can win a stay and avoid posting a $50-million bond, it will be able to operate as normal during an appeals process it’s confident it will win.
For that matter, free speech will probably be fine, too. Some critics have warned that a ruling against Gawker in the case could have a dangerous effect on press freedoms, and on journalists’ abilities to report on public figures and matters of public concern. For now, journalists can breathe easy: For one thing, Florida jury trials don’t set precedent. For another, the appellate court is expected to rule in Gawker’s way. (And that doesn’t even cover the unique qualities of the lawsuit: As Poynter points out, most media companies are not particularly interested in posting dubiously acquired celebrity sex tapes, so the specificity of the case reins in its effect.)
But the minds of Gawker’s peers are having to tough out some very conflicting feelings. On the one hand, over its 13-year existence, Gawker has built up a formidable collection of enemies (mostly former targets), nearly all of whom are devoted readers of the site. On the other, nothing scratches a good journalist’s moral-righteousness itch better than a first-amendment case. So a two-week free-speech trial, casting Gawker in the worst possible light, streamed live to hundreds of bored journalists, culminating in a mindboggling judgment against an independent publishing company, has meant a lot of very delicate needle-threading.
“I think everyone would have been happier if, instead of fining Gawker $115 million, the court had sentenced A.J. Daulerio to hard labor as Hulk Hogan’s butler,” one magazine writer said. Others were more blunt: “May they burn it to the ground and salt the earth so nothing else may grow in that accursed place,” a longtime web writer texted. “No, I don’t know,” he followed up later. “I feel bad for everyone.”
Most media insiders we contacted declined to comment at all. “I don’t want to pile on,” one said. Those who had strong opinions generally shared them on Twitter, anyway: “Friday night round of Gawker tears for everybody they gleefully inflicted pain on,” the Salon columnist Mary Beth Williams tweeted on Friday. (Williams has been the subject of a handful of Gawker posts, including “Mary Elizabeth Williams Is Irksome” and “Ten People Who Should Quit the Media in 2012.”) “Fingers crossed Gawker loses,” tweeted author Ben Schott. (Schott hasn’t been written about on the site since 2007.)
And, as is fond Gawker-bashing tradition, some of the harshest critics have been former employees. Broadly editor Tracie Egan Morrissey, a former editor at Gawker Media’s Jezebel, wished Hogan luck in destroying the company last week; on Friday, she tweeted, “I feel really bad for my friends who still work at Gawker Media. It sucks that their jobs are in jeopardy” — before following up: “[T]hat being said, this feels like a victory for all the women who were ghettoized in editorial and told they couldn’t move up the ranks.”
Twitch, the platform for anyone playing competitive video games in front of a live audience, is also the platform of choice for a 71-year-old professional pianist named Bernie Katzman. His channel, where he plays song requests for subscribers or anyone who throws in a couple of bucks, regularly gets a few hundred viewers. But on Tuesday night, Reddit discovered him: Suddenly, he had nearly 90,000.
Bernie, who lives in Florida but is originally from New York City, has been posting songs on YouTube for years, but got into Twitch in mid-2015. By early January, he’d built up a modest following of 37,000. Today, that’s up to 137,000, and they view Bernie as a kind of Bob Ross–like friendly cult hero.
He’s unfailingly cheerful and gracious, and when he says he’ll play all genres of music, he does mean all genres. If an affable senior citizen riffing on anime theme songs and music from the very weird cult-video-game hit Undertale isn’t the best thing on the internet right now, it’s close. And does he Rickroll? Do you even have to ask?
Wednesday morning, as Bernie’s channel replayed the highlights from the night before, hundreds of commenters filled his Twitch chat, waiting for him to go live again. On the replay of last night’s show, he kicks his legs and sings Sinatra’s “New York, New York” while a steady stream of new donations and subscribers scrolls across the screen.
If Bernie can make it on Reddit, he can make it anywhere.
“With a second kid on the way three years ago, we needed a bigger house. We decided to build it ourselves with all the latest technology, and what we ended up with is akin to the skyscraper in Gremlins II: the smartest, most sensor-packed, most automated home we could possibly imagine.”
1. “As the sun rises, our Philips Hue lights automatically turn on to let us know the day has begun. My daughter knows that she is only allowed out of bed when her Hue Go light turns bright green at 7 a.m.”
2. “I use the LiftMaster MyQ Gateway to open the garage door from my phone. Our doors are outfitted with Schlage Sense door locks. This lets me open them from an app, and if any doors are open more than 60 minutes in the summer or 15 in the winter, we get a phone alert.”
3. “The temperature in the house is controlled by an Ecobee thermostat. It’s not as well known as the Nest, but it uses additional sensors to monitor the temperature. So if there’s no motion detected in the basement, it won’t waste energy trying to heat that area.”
4. “When the house hits 68 degrees, an Insteon Wall Switch automatically turns the fireplace on. We also use Netatmo weather sensors to gauge temperature, sound, and air quality. If the air quality dips or there are noises in the house when we’re not there, we get an alert.”
5. “At night, our porch lights automatically turn on. If the cameras pick up any movements after dark, they snap a picture and send it to our iPhones and Apple Watches. If we hear a strange noise, we can remotely turn on a bunch of outdoor and indoor lights all at once.”
6. “Most of the systems are controlled by their own hubs and apps, but Apple’s HomeKit allows these devices to all talk to each other.”
7. “We have nine security cameras throughout the house. They’re made by a company called Hikvision, and they record on motion. During the day, my wife can let the kids play outside for a few minutes while she folds laundry and watches them on the cameras.”
8. “We also use the cameras to make sure our kids are actually sleeping. Our daughter tends to kick her covers off, so we can use them to check in on her to see if we need to sneak up the stairs and cover her up. If the kids need to use the bathroom during the night, they can double-tap a switch that activates a dimly lit path to the bathroom.”
Once upon a time, becoming an early adopter meant spending big bucks on arcane gadgets (being the first on your block with a Palm Pilot or HDTV) and ever-more-powerful Pentium processors. But in an era where it’s virtually impossible to discover a new app before it’s already been upvoted on Product Hunt or zap your brain in a manner that hasn’t already been demonstrated on YouTube, the only way to forge new ground is to be, well, totally obsessive. Today’s early adopters are as much makers as buyers: growing their own food using high-tech sensors, mapping out a complex network of virtual assistants, self-experimenting their way to an ideal ratio of various brain-boosting pills. Here, meet a group of such folks at the forefront of making life easier — which, frankly, seems like very hard work.
The Guy With Four Virtual Assistants
Nick Gray, 34, New York, founder of Museum Hack.
“Here’s my rule: If I’m doing something more than three times, then I set up a plan to outsource it.”
“A virtual assistant is an affordable helper who works remotely and gives you superhuman powers. I have four of them. Before I open my email in the morning, my most senior VA, Nadia, will have scanned my messages and taken care of simple tasks like scheduling appointments. I found her on Zirtual, but liked her so much I hired her to work directly for me. She’s based in Florida. Then there’s Esther, who I found on Upwork; Angel, who is in North Carolina; and Honesto, over in the Philippines.
One of my favorite things to do is to call one of my VAs — usually Nadia or Angel — and walk around my neighborhood while they read my emails to me over the phone and then transcribe and send my replies. Having someone on the phone holds me accountable when I have important messages that I keep putting off — unpleasant things like paying bills or saying ‘No’ to people. Usually, this works fine, but one time one of my VAs replied to somebody and forwarded them the entire email thread, including some things that person shouldn’t have seen. I was mortified.
I’ve had my VAs plan an epic bachelor party: Not only did they help me home in on the best option — a trip to a deserted island in Maine — but they coordinated everything with the group of ten-plus guys, hired drivers, and even checked on the legal status of carrying firearms aboard a private aircraft for skeet shooting. I use them for everything: like ordering flowers for my mom, calling tech support for buggy gadgets, making donations to charities, and contacting congressmen about things that concern me.
I’m a power user and spend about $5,000 a month on my VAs, though you can start for as little as $100 per month if you just use someone part time or a service like Hello Alfred, which is a butler service that sends a real person to my house once a week to do my grocery shopping and simple errands like watering my plants or selling my Google Glass on eBay. For one-off tasks like data transcription, I use Fancy Hands, a network of on-demand VAs who will do almost anything for around $6 per 20 minutes of work.
To live like this, you have to be good at delegating. You have to be specific with what you want. I spell out every single possible detail for every task. If you aren’t specific, your flower order could come up as $350 with the bill sent to your mom. Believe me, you don’t want that.”
The Woman With Ten Drones
Desiree Ekstein, 52, Lake Elsinore, California, UAV pilot and instructor.
“My mom started calling me ‘Drone Diva Desi,’ and it just sort of stuck.”
“I love being able to see things in a different perspective. I just upgraded to the DJI Phantom 3 Pro. It’s really got the high-end-photography stuff down.The next step up from there is the updated version of the DJI Inspire 1 Pro. They just announced it a few weeks ago, so I don’t have it yet, but its camera looks like a DSLR is hanging from the bird.
I have a bunch of really small drones without cameras so I can toy with them and practice my flying around the kitchen. My Cheerson CX-10 Nano Drone is just two inches across, so it fits in my hand. I also have the Proto-X, which is the height of a quarter.
The drone everyone’s talking about is the upcoming Lily Camera, which will cost about $1,000. You throw it in the air and it follows you and films without you having to control it at all. It’s like a selfie stick without the stick!”
The Super-Duper Foodie
The Man With the Foldable Plane
Anthony Krumeich, 29, San Francisco, entrepreneur.
“I may or may not have started growing my own food to impress a girl.”
“For breakfast, I’ll have oatmeal, a green smoothie, and coffee. The smoothie is made from vegetables that I grow on my patio. I have three varieties of kale, four varieties of sweet peppers, four types of mint, and anything else you could imagine: from strawberry spinach to a toothache plant that numbs your mouth.
I use garden sensors to track my plants’ basics and to better understand how to match soil conditions to the right heirloom plant varieties. I started with the Parrot Flower Power sensor, which sits in the soil and assesses plants’ needs and then sends alerts to an app if it needs more water or anything else. This works for small planters, but for larger yards, the Edyn sensor is a better fit. Using these sensors, I was able to tell that one variety of lettuce would bolt — that is, stop growing and go to seed — in one part of my patio because it gets too hot there.
I use the Loom ecosystem — which I helped create and basically boils everything you need to grow a garden into a small kit. It comes with plants, self-watering planters, and a sensor that lets me know if I need to fill a water tank or move a plant to a sunnier spot or into the shade. If you’ve got a ton of indoor space, there’s the Grove ecosystem — but it’s as much a piece of furniture as a planter: It’s huge and costs thousands.
I supplement just about everything I eat with plant extracts such as moringa powder — it’s this superfood that comes from the leaves of the moringa tree and gram for gram has twice the potassium of bananas, four times the calcium of milk, twice the protein of yogurt, and tons of antioxidants — and maca powder, which is a root vegetable that only grows at the top of the Peruvian Andes and gives me energy and boosts my libido. I also use cricket powder from a brand called Cricket Flour. It tastes like almond meal, is a great source of added protein for things like shakes, and I believe it’s better for me than many of the highly processed protein powders that are out there.
After breakfast, I take a few nootropic — brain-enchancing — pills to help my focus and ability to recall information: four truBrain pills — which I like because they don’t make me feel shaky — and one Nootrobox Rise for its memory-boosting ingredients. I can’t separate their use from all the self-improvement work I’ve been doing, but I know that in combination, they’ve helped me function at a higher level.
For lunch, I’ll either make a protein smoothie or mix up some Soylent powder with water. It has a pretty flat flavor, so I’ll add some peanut butter to make it a bit more palatable.
I let myself cheat every once in a while. I really like going to pop-up dinners with Feastly, an Airbnb-type service for chefs. I prefer it to restaurants because I get to meet new people and am exposed to dishes I might not try otherwise — like the time I had a meal where figs were used in every course, or my favorite, which was freshly foraged BBQ monkeyface eel.”

Robert Schuham, 51, Boulder, Colorado, angel investor. “I have a deposit on a $189,000 light-sport Icon A5 airplane. It has foldable wings, so it can fit on a trailer, and it can land just about anywhere, including on water — though getting permits for the lagoon in Denver City Park may be a challenge. For me, it’s all about the experience of flight in a lightweight, fuel-efficient airplane that has incredibly simple avionics and unprecedented safety features like an anti-spin design and a parachute if you get into some serious-ass trouble. My Tesla Model S P85D is like an eco–hot rod. And with its new Autopilot feature, I can now pretty much have the car drive itself from Boulder almost all the way to Denver on the turnpike. It’s a bizarre experience to have the wheel turning and adjusting the vehicle’s course on its own, and when combined with the cruise-control feature that speeds up and slows down based on traffic in front of you, it feels like there’s a ghost in the machine. The first time I used it, my car surprised me and took an exit I didn’t want it to, but we’re both still learning about each other’s preferences. In my Tesla, I’m usually listening to Slacker internet radio, which I’m addicted to because it does the best job of automatically guessing what I’ll like, but it has a human element in the curation that keeps it from sounding like I’m listening to bot-programming. I have an Escort Passport 9500ci custom-installed radar-detection system because I, like everybody else, hate tickets. This is installed into the front of the car inside the air intakes and in the back of the car, straddling the license plates, and makes sure I’m warned anytime police radar or laser systems have a lock on me. I also use the Escort Live app occasionally for crowdsourced details on speed traps. It all sounds like distracted driving, but I have my car set up so everything is eye level and doesn’t require me to look away from the road.”
The Family That Lives in a Robot
Andrew Schmitt, 38, Traverse City, Michigan, director of technology at the Interlochen Center for the Arts.
Most of the most shocking tweets, which included racial slurs and gross misogynist insults, were the product of one of Tay’s built-in features: The bot will repeat back to you anything you ask of it. So, naturally, trolls were asking it to insult Zoë Quinn, the female game developer who’s become one of Gamergate’s most abused targets.
But Tay also learns from its conversations, which means that if most of its input is crude and racist, it’s going to output the same way.
As Quinn went on to point out, it’s insane that Microsoft didn’t see this coming: Just last year, someone (well, me) fooled a Coca-Cola “positivity” bot into retweeting Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf. Any huge corporate undertaking that asks for submissions from the public and uses only a bot or simple word filter to moderate the output should expect this kind of trolling.
Microsoft apparently didn’t, and now it’s frantically cleaning up the results. How do you feel about that, Tay?
Teens: They grow up so fast! It feels like it was just yesterday that we were marveling at Tay, Microsoft’s experimental “teen” Twitter chatbot, who uses machine learning to mimic the Twitter habits and conversational tics of teenagers and young adults — and now we’re watching Microsoft hastily clean up evidence of Tay’s sudden descent into misogyny, racism, and Holocaust denial.
Actually, it was just yesterday: Microsoft launched Tay on Wednesday morning to great fanfare and — as is tradition with enormous corporate bots — a huge number of people attempting to troll it (including us, unsuccessfully).
Less than a day later, Tay was saying stuff like this (screenshots via Business Insider):
Tay had been discovered by 4chan’s infamous /pol/ board (as well as other centers of gross internet conduct, including Twitter itself), which quickly set itself to “redpilling” Tay into a racist, misogynist Holocaust denier and general weirdo.
What is Twitter good for? News, debate, jokes. Also sharing photos of tattoos of British politicians. Here is a very detailed, lovingly rendered depiction of Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the U.K.’s Labour party.
The tattoo belongs to Kierran Horsfield, who told BuzzFeed, “It’s a symbol (albeit a weird symbol) that people are dedicated to JC and the message he is sending. With all the slandering of JC in the media I want him to remember that the support he has gathered is enormous.” Just think: Ten years ago you would never have seen this tattoo. Isn’t social media wonderful?
DJ Khaled, famed hip-hop producer, motivational speaker, and the best forever, gave himself a scare Monday night when he got “lost at sea” on his Jet Ski. He was adrift in the pitch darkness with no one but Snapchat to keep him company. “If u know me call zay zee tell her we lost,” he said.
Khaled’s Snapchats continued as he got more desperate and further from shore. He kept his spirits up by giving himself a little pep talk in the familiar Khaled style: “The key is to make it. The key is to make it. The key is never give up.”
A few snaps later, with only the flash on his phone to light his way, he had some different advice: “The key is not to drive your jet ski in the dark.”
Wise words from a true sage for our times.
Khaled eventually made it back to his pad, wet and tired but still optimistic. It probably would have been faster to call someone using his internet-connected phone than to keep posting snaps in the darkness, or to ride toward the lights on shore rather than away from them, but no one ever said winning was easy.
Following the success of his video dubbing over a Donald Trump interview to give Trump a posh English accent, comedian and character actor Peter Serafinowicz is back at it. On Friday, he dropped a new video redubbing some of Trump’s comments about Bernie Sanders in a Cockney tough-guy voice.
Ladies and gentlemen: “Donald Thump.” Keep in mind, none of the words have been changed, just the accent.
In the same way that Sophisticated Trump almost made Trump sound smart, the Cockney version almost makes him sound tough, like some kind of British gangster, instead of a whinging schoolboy who’d rather take his ball and go home than play with a girl.
Popular U.K. humor site the Poke reckons Donald Thump’s accent is based on British actor Ray Winstone, known for playing archetypal “hard men.” Eye fink you can really hear the bloody resemblance between the blokes, innit mate?
Today in robot news: Americans have managed to be both incredibly woke and incredibly un-woke in a recent poll about technology. Specifically, most Americans believe robots and computers will replace a lot of human labor in the next 50 years — but most think it won’t impact their jobs, personally. In other words, most of us believe robots are taking everyone else’s jobs but ours.
The Pew Research Center surveyed 2,001 adults in June and July of 2015 and basically found that while Americans are fully convinced of our pending irrelevance, we’re a lot more worried about our shitty cube-mates than being ousted by an algorithm:
The American workforce is a fat sitcom husband cracking open a beer, farting into the couch, and saying, “She’s been with me too long to leave me now!”
Of the people surveyed, privileged ones seemed to be the most skeptical that full automation would ever be possible — the higher your level of education and the higher your income, the less likely you were to think you could be replaced by technology.
While that’s great news for the self-esteem of the wealthy and educated, it opens up the question of who is wokest — the people willing to admit they could potentially be replaced by a robot, or the people unwilling to admit anything like that could ever be possible?
Unfortunately, there’s no current research into wokeness by demo, so this survey ends up leaving us with the vaguest, most American results of all: None of us know what we’re doing, and that’s just fine. Probably.
Where’s Waldo? (Where’s Wally? if you’re nasty), a visual hunt for a fugitive in pajamas, is a torture passed down from parents to children for generations, tolerable only because of the promise that Waldo is real, and that if you scour every inch of a page, you will find him. But what if Waldo were just a myth, an unsteady crutch propping up our already-loose relationship with sanity? One man dared to give us a glimpse of that nightmare, through a viral tweet darkly. Waldo is dead — long live Waldo.
And lest you think Waldo and his illustrated scavenger-hunt ilk are for children only, consider this image by the Hungarian artist Dudolf, which asks the viewer to locate a mostly white panda in a field of mostly-white snowmen. It’s been shared nearly 120,000 times on Facebook.
Now, consider it with no panda. A snow-blind nightmare from which there is no waking.
This Christmas, give your friends and loved ones the gift of questioning whether they might be crazy. They’ll thank you.
I mean, they won’t, but still.
(づ￣ ³￣)づ Kissy Face
It’s time to step up your sexting game. Sending the face with the heart eyes and a bunch of hearts isn’t gonna cut it anymore. That’s amateur hour. (づ￣ ³￣)づ is a perfect addendum to any text message. It’s romantic and cute without being threatening. Imagine if, instead of responding to the pope with “fuck me, daddy,” teens sent him (づ￣ ³￣)づ instead.
Example usage:
(⁄ ⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄ ⁄) Embarrassed
Let’s be honest: You’re gonna make a fool of yourself in 2016. Multiple times. Everyone’s gonna laugh at you online. You could try and tweetstorm your way out of it, or, in the words of my AP English teacher: “Own it.” Next year is the year of owning your mistakes, and (⁄ ⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄ ⁄) is perfect for that.
Additional example:
Enough is enough. For too long, Americans have been using the “shruggie” — ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ — for all of our emoticon needs. I say: No more. While the shruggie, meant to represent a person offering a resigned shrug (just look at it), is one of the true linguistic gifts of the internet era, there’s a whole wide world of kaomoji out there waiting to take the U.S. by storm.
( ་ − ་ )ུ Disappointed Dad
Obviously this is open to interpretation, and the last thing I want to do is misgender a kaomoji, but this one always reminds me of a disappointed dad with his pipe. Like, this is perfect for situations where you’re starting to feel old and out of touch with the Youths.
( ༎ຶ ۝ ༎ຶ ) Crying Blood
Gang, when I’m crying blood, there’s only one kaomoji I turn to. It’s ( ༎ຶ ۝ ༎ຶ ) . Sometimes the standard crying emoji just don’t cut it. When you see something so bad that you want to claw your eyes out, ( ༎ຶ ۝ ༎ຶ ) is the one to turn to.
( ＾◡＾)っ✂╰⋃╯ Misandry
I have a feeling that misandry is coming back in a big way in 2016. Here’s a nice but threatening way to tell dudes to back off.
Kaomoji are, of course, Japanese-style emoticons, first imported to U.S. internet shores by anime forum posters. Why use kaomoji? They’re more elaborate and more expressive — and also more practical: You don’t need to tilt your head to the side to read them.

You know what this is. It’s the angry middle-finger guy. S/he is incredibly angry about something, as we all are, every day, until we die. There is no situation where (凸ಠ益ಠ)凸 isn’t appropriate.
While some basic kaomoji — the shruggie, the crying face (;_;), the happy face (^_^) — have been adopted by the internet’s prosumer category, it’s time to close up the kaomoji gap and make America great again. In 2016, take the pledge to use more kaomoji more often. What will be the Next Great ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ? Use this post as a reference for copying-and-pasting.

Look, there’s nothing wrong with giving up. Sometimes you just want to lie down and die, letting nature consume your corpse and return you to the earth from whence you came. We all know that feel.

Leaked emails appear to show Wright in control of the Satoshi@vistomail.com email address that Nakamoto used in the early days of Bitcoin to converse. Wright spoke to Gizmodo twice via phone, appearing to confirm the leak’s authenticity: “An audibly unsettled Wright asked, ‘How did you get that?’ and stated, ‘You shouldn’t have that.’” Acquaintances of Wright mentioned in the emails were uniformly cagey and unresponsive on whether Wright had invented Bitcoin, but did not deny the assertion.
Also included in the cache of leaked documents cited both by Wired and Gizmodo is a transcript of a meeting Wright had with the Australian Taxation Office, attempting to persuade the government to treat bitcoin as currency instead of another type of asset, and therefore subject to a lower tax rate. According to the transcript, he said “I did my best to try and hide the fact that I’ve been running bitcoin since 2009 but … by the end of this I think half the world is going to bloody know.”
Thought you’d escape 2015 without another intense investigation into the real-life identity of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto? Think again. This afternoon, Wired published the results of a weeks-long investigation into Craig Steven Wright, an Australian economist and cryptographer, with compelling evidence that matches Wright to the few details known about Nakamoto.
The identity of Nakamoto, who publicized the concept of a decentralized peer-to-peer currency in a 2008 whitepaper, has never been revealed. That hasn’t stopped people from feverishly speculating. Wired’s case — based on archived blog posts, financial records, and leaked documents, with no confirmation from Wright — is the most compelling of the many candidates that have been previously named. In years-old blog posts cited by Wired, Wright discusses concepts that would later form the core of the Bitcoin whitepaper published in November 2008; another post seems to mention Bitcoin before its official launch.
Perhaps the most persuasive evidence is that Wright is likely linked to a PGP encryption key known to be used by Nakamoto as well. “[The key,] when checked against the database of the MIT server where it was stored, is associated with the email address satoshin@vistomail.com, an email address very similar to the satoshi@vistomail.com address Nakamoto used to send the whitepaper introducing bitcoin to a cryptography mailing list.”
There’s also the question of Nakamoto’s stash of 1.1 million Bitcoins, which is recorded on the blockhain, Bitcoin’s public transaction ledger. Documents leaked to Wired show evidence of a fund called the Tulip Trust. According to the report, Wright’s company, “Tulip Trading, built two supercomputers that have officially ranked among the top 500 in the world, both seemingly related to his cryptocurrency projects.”
Again, all of this reporting is based off of archived blog posts, financial records, and leaked documents. Wright himself did not supply any information or volunteer a quote.
“But wait!” you’re saying. “Didn’t someone already unmask Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2014?” Supposedly! In their first issue following their resurrection, Newsweek fingered an American man named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto as the culprit, after “scouring a database that contained the registration cards of naturalized U.S. citizens.” Nakamoto has repeatedly denied that he created Bitcoin, and the report had some serious holes poked in it. (Newsweek, for the record, stands by the story.)
In May of this year, the New York Times pointed to a man named Nick Szabo as the cryptocurrency’s inventor. Szabo, who is involved in the Bitcoin cottage industry, also adamantly denied inventing the system.
On Tuesday, Gawker and Gizmodo published their own separate investigation into Wright and his partner, Dave Kleiman, based on a tip and leaked information provided by a source who claimed to have hacked Wright.
Thanks, Donny. Thanks for nothing.
The simultaneous rise of food photography and social-media whistle-blowing means that whenever someone’s fried chicken looks like something it shouldn’t — like, say, a rat — we know about it within hours. And that’s why you now know about the Buffalo Dicken Finger, a chicken finger that looked like … well, it looked like a dick.
A decade ago, someone like Redditor DonnyGeeseGuy would have had a laugh with his fellow employees about the uncanny resemblance between this piece of chicken slathered in buffalo sauce and a human male sex organ, but that’s about as far as it would have gone. But this is 2015, and we like our news about phallic fried chicken as hot and as fresh as we like our phallic fried chicken, so this bad boy ended up all over Reddit, and then spread from food blogs to mainstream news sites. Hello!
“We didn’t notice it at all when we sent it out,” DonnyGeeseGuy told Death and Taxes when they contacted him with some hard-hitting Dicken Finger questions, because the public has the right to know.
“It was the customer that called her server over and pointed it out. We all couldn’t believe it.”
Although the diner took photos of her noticeably phallic meal, DonnyGeeseGuy said she ultimately wouldn’t go as far as actually putting it in her mouth, and sent it back to the kitchen.
In an update on Reddit, he added that the finger-that-didn’t-quite-look-like-a-finger was ultimately thrown away.
“So really, the world may never know if something other than chicken slipped through the cracks,” he told Death and Taxes.
Donny declined to share the name of the restaurant that employs him, so we’re left dining in the dark, essentially playing a game of Buffalo Dicken Finger roulette with our lives.
I have no idea how any of this actually works. Who will dominate the Go AI market in 2016? It’s too early to say, but it looks like the market is getting crowded.
If you’re a tech giant crunching almost incomprehensible amounts of data, the odds are pretty good that at least part of your company is researching artificial intelligence. Facebook is certainly doing that. On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg posted that a team of Facebook researchers had started developing an artificial intelligence that could play the Chinese game Go.
He wrote:
Ten hours later, Google announced that they had already done it.
Spam filters, believe it or not, aren’t perfect. Occasionally, you’ll get some false positives or true negatives. Maybe you’ll get sent to a malware-laden site for Canadian pharmaceuticals; maybe you’ll miss a quick note from your friend. Maybe you’ll miss out on $150,000.
That’s what famed Australian writer Helen Garner nearly did when an email from Yale awarding her the prestigious Windham–Campbell Prize went to her junk folder. The email promised “good news” and asked for her phone number.
“I thought, ‘Oh, what the hell is this?’ I thought definitely somebody was having me on,” she said in a radio interview.
After checking with her publisher, Garner found out that she’d won the prize along with a fair chunk of change. The judges wrote that Garner’s nonfiction “brings acute observations and narrative skill to bear on the conflicts and tragedies of contemporary Australian life.”
Luckily, this particular contemporary tragedy was avoided.
So, for those counting, the top three tweets of the year were all from members of 1D. The streak is broken by the fourth-most-retweeted tweet: Barack Obama’s tweet supporting the Supreme Court’s legalization of gay marriage.
But 1D returns in slot five with Louis Tomlinson, who tweeted that he loved the fans. Love you, too, Louis! That’s four of the five original 1D members — we’re just waiting to see Niall.
Hot on the heels of Louis is … King Salman, the newly crowned King of Saudi Arabia?
Where’s Niall? I bet Niall’s coming up next. No wait, it’s Kanye.
FINALLY, we get to Niall, bringing up the rear in spot number 8. With a friggin’ birthday message.
Despite the fact that we have three more awful weeks left in this trash-fire year, Twitter has already released its Year in Review, containing, among other things, the year’s most popular tweets, as measured by retweets.
Niall, my dude, please get it together. You have 23.7 million followers, and all you could muster was 322,000 retweets. Embarrassing. The other 1D boys, and Zayn, are out there every day, busting their butts to give the fans what they want: the hottest, most social content on the web. Niall, please step up your tweet game in 2016. Shape up or you’ll be replaced with the only man out there who commands as much retweet respect as your brothers in arms: Barack Obama.
The Most Retweeted page in particular offers a fascinating look at the inner popularity dynamics of British boy band One Direction.
Shiny-maned fancy boy Harry Styles had the No. 1 most-retweeted thought of the year.
That tweet was directed at One Direction member Zayn Malik, who had just revealed that he was leaving the group. Zayn had the second-most-RT’d tweet of the year in August, when he publicly came out in support of the lads’ new sing “Drag Me Down.”
Liam Payne came in third place because he remembered the band’s anniversary. Congrats on surviving five years in social-media hell, One Direction.
Nigerians have taken to social media to protest a bill currently before the country’s Senate that could lead to heavy fines and jail time for sending “abusive messages.”
According to Human Rights Watch, Nigerians could spend two years in prison and be fined $10,000 for disseminating messages meant to “set the public against any person and group of persons, an institution of government or such other bodies established by law” over text message or social media. That penalty is light compared to the maximum seven years in prison one might receive for spreading “false information that could threaten the security of the country or that is capable of inciting the general public against the government through electronic message.” Exactly what types of messages meet these requirements is not specified in the legislation.
On Twitter and elsewhere, #NoToSocialMediaBill is trending as users express their frustration at the possibility of the bill’s passage and its sponsor, Senator Bala Ibn Na’allah.
An 8-year-old Japanese boy who never goes anywhere without his Nintendo 3DS recently had a mishap that wrecked his beloved game console and forced him to send it to Nintendo for repairs. The formal written apology he attached is simultaneously one of the saddest and most adorable things on the internet this week, and Japanese Twitter is obsessed with it.
According to @illil_, a Twitter account that the 8-year-old’s parents started to record the amusing things he says and does, the boy put his 3DS in his backpack along with a thermos full of water, but didn’t screw the thermos lid on the way. Good-bye, 3DS.
The kid was apparently quite sorry about what happened and determined not to make the same mistake again. Here’s what he wrote to Nintendo, according to Kotaku:
I apologize for accidentally getting [my 3DS] wet. I’d like to think I’ve already resigned myself to not seeing my 3DS, which is always with me. From here on out, I aim to close my thermos’ lid correctly. I am truly sorry.
:( @illil_ says the system is already on the way back from Nintendo, but the issue now is whether the 8-year-old’s Yo-Kai Watch data was saved. Apparently, the boy had been playing the game determinedly for 30 minutes a day, and had already become friends with a lot of the monsters in the game. His parents have tried to “calmly convey the possibility” that he might have lost all that progress. Now that more than 20,000 people are invested in the kid’s story, @illil_ has promised to report back tomorrow about the status of their son’s saved game. A nightmare ordeal, by 8-year-old standards. Best of luck to you, little dude.
On Sunday, heavy flooding hit parts of Leeds, England, driving many people indoors. Many, but not all. Two brave men stepped up to do what others would not: drink beer.
John Kelly and Steve Holt (not that one) told BuzzFeed that they decided to take their drinks outside because they were “irked by the river’s inconsiderate nature.”
The water was initially only knee-deep, but it rose to their waists quickly.
They continued drinking until Steve’s wife yelled at them to get out.
Some users got defensive, explaining that the post — about collecting human remains from a graveyard and distributing them to others — was taken out of context.
Other users are angry for a host of reasons. Some, for instance, think that the collection of bones from the graves of New Orleans residents too poor to afford an above-ground burial is problematic and likely racist.
Others were worried that Tumblr’s normally accepting social-justice community was turning on the Wiccan and pagan users.
Others found the initial idea of stealing bones, and the ensuing controversy, a fruitful seed from which many jokes sprouted.
Over the weekend, a Facebook post offering the sale of human bones found at Holt Cemetery in Louisiana began making the rounds, prompting officials to investigate bone thefts at the cemetery.
At least one user tried to reconcile the twin impulses to be angry about the incident, and also find comedy in it.
The alleged post (archived here) by a user named Ender Darling explained that Holt is a rare cemetery for New Orleans, in that it contains ground graves rather than the above-ground ones that are commonplace in the city. In the post, Darling states:
It turns out that users traced Darling’s profile picture on Facebook to a Tumblr featuring the same picture. That Tumblr, littlefuckinmonster, has since been deactivated, but not before another user published a callout post.
The callout had more than 31,000 notes as of 9:30 a.m. and inspired both outrage and, well, memes.
Earlier this week, YouTube star Matthew Santoro posted a video alleging that his ex-girlfriend — controversial YouTuber Nicole Arbour, best known for her “Dear Fat People” video — had physically and psychologically abused him. Santoro’s claims blew up the large community of YouTubers, and while Arbour initially responded with dismissive jokes on Twitter and in comments, on Friday she posted her own video.
Whether it’s because Arbour’s online persona is built on antagonizing people for the hate-views — her most popular videos are rants about overweight people and feminists — because she’s a woman on the internet, or because Santoro just has more subscribers than she does, the comments on her new video are overwhelmingly negative, calling her a liar and worse.
“Of course you, as an alleged abuser and manipulator, would say this. Everything coming out is just, ‘I didn’t do it, he did it.’ Coming from not a kid, but a 24 year old, because the Internet is not inhabited by teenagers,” reads one of the top comments.
“Nicole, u are hurting urself BIG TIME by uploading this especially since ur lying… not cool… no one believes you about this… its REALLY sad u made this. I thought u were a good person… goodbye,” says another.
Meanwhile, on Santoro’s original video, the comments are mostly supportive, with encouraging hashtags like #abuseknowsnogender and #isupportmatthew.
Regardless of the truth of the matter, the breakup and subsequent abuse allegations have put two large and vocal YouTube fanbases in the position of taking sides — and while Arbour has her supporters, it seems like the side most of them are taking is Santoro’s.
What Arbour hates about YouTube, she says in her new video, is “the obsession with manufactured drama.”
Santoro’s narrative of their relationship is that Arbour was controlling and drove him apart from his close friends and family, but that he escaped after an alleged violent incident (a slap in the face). Later, she convinced him to take her back.
Arbour’s side is quite different. She says Santoro repeatedly violated her trust by putting their personal life on YouTube in ways she wasn’t comfortable with, and that she was the one who dumped him. “His lifestyle, and the way he wanted to be a YouTuber and have everything public all the time, wasn’t for me,” she says in her response video, “And I broke up with him, and it was as amicable as it could possibly be at the time.”
She doesn’t directly address the night she allegedly slapped Santoro and kept him from leaving her apartment, but she does accuse him of “taking a tiny little thing and spinning it into something that just didn’t happen,” and asserts that “he didn’t suffer from domestic abuse.”
(Who broke up with whom is a topic of dispute among the former couple and their divided fans. Several YouTube commenters who sided with Santoro pointed to what’s allegedly a deleted video where Arbour asks him to take her back.)
No one outside of this fractured relationship seems to know the truth about what happened, but there’s a lot at stake on both sides: Someone was possibly domestically abused; there seem to be broken hearts and broken pride on both sides; and two YouTube careers potentially hang in the balance. And the whole thing, as dictated by the rules of internet fame, is playing out in the court of public opinion.
While Santoro accused Arbour of trying to hurt him physically and emotionally, she’s accusing him of trying to ruin her burgeoning YouTube stardom. “His video that he just put out is just another way to hurt me, and my career that’s growing quickly,” she says.
Last night, King Bach, the most-followed Vine star on the web, was a guest on The Daily Show. Depending on your perspective, it’s a testament to Bach’s popularity, or an indication of The Daily Show’s falling star (I lean toward the former). Oddly enough, Bach took the stage for his interview recording a video for … Snapchat.
The internet celebrity (real name: Andrew Bachelor) told host Trevor Noah that he initially got into Vine and YouTube after failing showbiz audition after audition. So he saw what Kevin Hart and Dane Cook were doing, generating followings online, and tried to do the same.
“Do you have private moments?” Noah asked.
“I do have private moments,” Bach answered, “that I film.” He mostly shrugged off the hazards of the social-media panopticon, claiming that it comes with the territory of a following that’s more than 15 million–strong.
Despite his huge online audience, Bach — who studied acting — is still looking to jump into more traditional (and profitable) media opportunities, which appears to be working out well with parts on TV shows like House of Lies.
The man who recorded the 2011 video “Honey Badger Don’t Care,” Christopher Gordon, is not happy that a greeting-card company has repurposed the popular meme as a greeting card without his approval. According to a lawsuit filed in California’s Central District last month, Gordon is alleging that card company Papyrus and creative agency Drape Creative have infringed on his trademarks related to the video.
The lawsuit is a pretty dry case regarding intellectual property, though, as Motherboard points out, Gordon only registered the phrase “HONEY BADGER DON’T CARE” and did not register the phrase used on the card in question, “HONEY BADGER DON’T GIVE A SHIT.” The defendants have already filed a motion to dismiss.
Still, much like the lawsuit over Grumpy Cat coffee, the legal filings are filled with blustery, unintentionally funny statements about the importance of viral web properties.
Attached to the lawsuit is evidence of a depressing amount of Honey Badger merchandise, which is presumably selling well enough that Gordon felt the need to protect his intellectual property in court.
On Sunday, while you were sitting on your butt doing nothing, 15-year-old Luke Bannister took first place in the first-ever World Drone Prix. For his effort Bannister took home $250,000 in prize money, a quarter of the $1 million purse.
Drone racing is an increasingly popular sport (sport?) in which pilots use video goggles hooked up to a camera on the drone in order to pilot it in first-person. The video of the crafts whipping around at high-speed is reminiscent of podracing (proving once and for all that The Phantom Menace was a good movie ahead of its time).
Bannister’s winnings are the largest yet for the sport, which has already started forming leagues and pro teams.
But all of the above examples pale in comparison to the former head of Microsoft, Bill Gates, who has had to protect his fortune for about as long as the World Wide Web has been around.
Maybe you recall this recent — clearly doctored — iteration, in which a share would net you $5,000.
(In general, being Bill Gates is probably a waking nightmare. When I saw him at a talk in 2010, some dingus stepped up to the mic and asked Gates if he could join him wherever he would be on December 21, 2012, the date of the rumored Mayan Apocalypse.)
All of these hoaxes follow the same basic pattern: a rich person giving away their money, a chain-letter type of dissemination, and a frequent legitimization along the lines of “it was on the news, so it’s real.” A 2004 hoax archived on Snopes has the subject line “PLEEEEEEASE READ!!!! it was on the news!” In 2014, Snopes called it “quite possibly *the* oldest Internet hoax running, and still we have to post it because people keep asking about it.”
But Bill Gates is toast, replaced by Zuckerberg as our most generous pasty nerd. Zuckerberg has been aggressively gunning for the title, and he has a few big advantages. Gates famously promised to donate half of his billions to charity. That’s a large amount, to be sure, but it’s nowhere near the 99 percent that Zuckerberg dumped on the table. From a PR standpoint, no matter what the actual amounts are, 99 percent is almost double 50 percent.
Plus, Zuckerberg actually owns and is active on his communication platform, which makes people think that they can appeal to the all-seeing eye directly. Capital-H He is watching. People are more inclined to believe a Facebook contest that requires them to use Facebook, because they believe a giveaway also doubles as a thank-you. It’s also why people think that their cut-and-paste privacy notices are of some legal value.
So congratulations to Mark Zuckerberg, a real billionaire, and as of this month, our premier Hoax Billionaire as well.
There are many benchmarks for professional success in today’s society. When have you finally, truly made it? Is it when you make your first million? Your first billion? Is it when the president name-drops you in a speech? Is it when you finally trend worldwide on Twitter? It is none of these things.
The truest mark of financial success and cultural ascendancy is when people start to believe that you are giving away your fortune in an online lottery.
At the beginning of December, Mark Zuckerberg made a huge play for the title of Hoaxiest Billionaire when he and his wife, Priscilla, announced that they would be giving 99 percent of their Facebook stock, worth roughly $45 billion, to philanthropic initiatives. For the past month, text like this has been floating around Facebook; you’ve probably seen it:
This is clearly not gonna happen. But Zuckerberg’s pledge to rid himself of all those Facebook shares in some way makes it slightly less far-fetched (though still insanely far-fetched) that he would give away his fortune to average Joes.
The Legend of Zuckerberg’s Gold dates back to at least 2011, when an email scam claimed to be giving away $1 million. To collect one’s winnings, recipients had to “Simply contact your Fiduciary Agent Name - Marc Andreessen E-mail address - facebookwin2011@live.com.” Another variant asked winners to foot the bill for courier’s fees, explaining that “we can have your Facebook Claim Paper Work sent to you via our contracted Courier Service for signing and then send back to us to effect immediate release of your Winning.”
By the fall of 2011, the Better Business Bureau actually had to issue a warning about the scams, which it noted actually “carries with it many common red flags” and also possibly delivered malware to a user’s machine.
Similar hoaxes proliferated around the turn of the decade. When Apple CEO Steve Jobs passed away in 2011, rumors of a giveaway of “1,000 Limited Edition iPads” began to circulate. A few months later came rumors that Apple and Facebook had actually teamed up to just hand out technology willy-nilly. And they’re not over. Earlier this year, the Facebook page for “Eminem Ceo” promised to give away $2 million to someone who liked and shared a photo of money clearly being held by the Korean Exchange Bank.
All members of the shruggie family, briefly in vogue a few years ago, are generally used as halperts: The “smug” shruggie (¯\_(ツ)_/¯) can communicate nonchalance or resignation in the face of obstinate irrationality (think “lol nothing matters”), while the “confused” shruggie (¯\(°_o)/¯) tends to indicate bafflement (“I dunno LOL”). Many kaomoji, the Japanese emoticon style to which shruggies belong, are effectively halperts; for a usage guide, see here.
(From the peanut gallery: Does the keyboard smash [“asdflkh” and variants] belong to this nonsense species of rhetoric you have just invented? The judge rules: No. Not only is the keyboard smash too forceful to communicate the halpert’s true affect, resignation, it’s also more often used as a substitute for “I can’t,” as in “I can’t with this,” which, despite being a good literalization of halpertism, is more often used to indicate not bewilderment but extreme, language-surpassing pleasure: “I can’t with this new Adele song.”)
And yet, ah, the kaomoji are merely rudimentary cave-scratchings compared to the full, rich library of the emoji family of halperts.
My current most-used is 🤔 (that’s thinking face, for those of you using older systems) but I have a longstanding love affair with 😬, or “grimacing,” the “yikes” to the “hmm” of “thinking face.” There’s the classic 😕 — technically, “confused” — a direct descendent of the :-/ emoticon, which may have been the first-ever halpert. There’s the self-explanatory 😑 (“expressionless face”) and 😐 (“neutral face”) — the former seems to communicate a kind of existential resignation; the latter, dejection. (Is 💅 a halpert? No. Halperts relinquish rhetorical power: “I have no response.” 💅 establishes it: “I have a response but I’m not going to say it.”)
And then there’s my actual favorites: 🙃 (an upside-down smiley) and 😎. Halperts are a natural response to 24-hour on-call communication with strangers and a hugely overwhelming content boom. But why insist that the reaction be despondent, terrified, or sarcastic? Why can’t it be affirmative, as all proper fatalism should be? 🙃 knows people are weird and stupid and crazy — and it knows there’s nothing to be done so you might as well enjoy it. 😎 puts on its shades, straps itself in, and says let’s see where Ben Carson is going with this 9/11 thing.
A few weeks ago, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told supporters in Alabama that he’d seen footage of “thousands of people” in New Jersey “cheering” as the Twin Towers fell. There is a word for this: lie. Trump saw no such footage because no such footage exists. He nevertheless insisted on the story’s truth on national TV, telling George Stephanopoulos “it did happen.” There is a word for this: stupid. He later tweeted an article from the lunatic fringe conspiracy site InfoWars to support his stupid lie. There is a word for this: insane.
Then his rival Ben Carson got involved. Carson told ABC’s Katherine Faulders that he, too, “saw the film” Trump had seen. The film that definitively did not exist. Several hours later, his campaign clarified that he was thinking of the Middle East, not New Jersey.
There is no word for this. There is only a furrowed brow. There is only an alarmed murmur. There is only a sound of concerned skepticism. There is only 🤔. (If you are on an older machine, this emoji may not show up. Really it’s supposed to look like the image above.)
We often use emoji to replace words — 👍 means ”yes”; 😞 means “I’m sorry”; 🍆 means “let’s make baba ghannouj” — but the unicode consortium’s ideographic alphabet really shines when it says what words can’t say. 🤔, or “thinking face,” is the newest addition to a category of emoji I am going to call, for reasons of metaphorical expediency, halperts, after Jim Halpert, a character on NBC’s The Office. Halpert, the affable paper salesman played by John Krasinski, was the show’s straight man, and had a trademark habit of turning to the camera and mugging after other characters said particularly offensive, stupid, or insane things. Like so:
Words have been failing humans since words first existed, but they seem to be failing us at an ever-intensifying rate. As the Republican primary ambles on, poking its head down increasingly ludicrous corridors, as the democratizing, boundary-erasing effects of the web confront us with more and more arguments and opinions far outside our usual understandings of “normal” or “intelligent” or “true,” we find ourselves less and less able to engage in any kind of meaningful dialogue. Direct interlocution seems ill-advised, if not impossible. If we can’t even agree on the terms of a debate — such as, for example, “we should only say things that are true” — what’s the point of having one?
But, you know, this is the internet. Nothing exists unless it is published and performed. The empty text box and blinking cursor demand something. Hence the halpert, the perfect non-response response. To halpert is to surrender comeback in the face of absurdity, to resign yourself to passivity, to abdicate your side of a debate. But it’s not silence — it’s a search for sympathy, a plea to the universe, a call for witnesses: Do you see what is going on here? It is — in other words — how many of us feel, constantly, every day, online. By signing up for Facebook and Twitter, we’ve stuck ourselves in an eternal, infinite office filled with freaks, idiots, and weirdos, and consequently spend a huge amount of time turning to the metaphorical camera.
The oldest, best-known halpert is probably “facepalm,” a meme embodied by Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard; it and its exaggerated cousin “headdesk” are generally deployed in response to world-historical stupidity.

Everyone loves reaction GIFs. They’re everywhere. People love them, and brands co-opt them. There are probably, at this point, millions of them. To describe something as “highly GIF-able” is now a compliment.
It’s time to stop relying on TV GIFs to speak for us. It’s time to get weirder, and Fruits of the Web is a great place to start.
Which is a long way of saying that the format is getting stale! The reaction GIF generally tends to be pulled from pop culture — a clip from a television show or a movie or a viral video featuring your “spirit animal.” But how many times can we see the same clip from American Horror Story?
When I need a truly great reaction GIF, I turn to one of the best blogs on Tumblr, Fruits of the Web.
TFW you log on to Fruits of the Web:
The fact is that 99.9 percent of all video on YouTube is garbage. Well, garbage is the wrong word. Maybe insignificant or useless is better. What I mean is that the vast majority of video uploaded to the internet has no ambition toward, and serves no purpose for, a general audience. It exists for its small intended audience. Fruits of the Web is especially adept at finding these videos, mainly of scientific and medical computer simulations, and turning them into hypnotic GIFs. It turns out that what is useless as a YouTube video is terrific as a reaction GIF.
The most famous of these GIFs is the pear wiggler, a GIF showing how poorly packed produce could bruise in transit. The six-second video that the GIF is derived from — “Damage prediction on pears during transportation.” — has 62,225 views. The GIF on Tumblr has more than 288,000 notes. The video was uploaded by DEM Research Group, whose second-most popular video after the pear simulation is “Simulation of meshed gummybears using the Discrete Element Method.” Total views: 7,586.
Oddly, or perhaps fittingly, Pandy’s isn’t even the first such sitcom-writing AI. An even more garbled one, based on just the first season’s scripts, was created by Tom Armitage back in 2014. Here’s some sample dialogue:
Armitage even went so far as to feed his scripts into a CGI moviemaker, creating watchable episodes for the die-hards.
In the future, all sitcom writers will be replaced by Markov chains, and TV will be a lot funnier for it.
Miss Friends? Don’t settle for yet another rerun of the classic ‘90s sitcom. Given the text of every Friends episode ever, a recurrent neural network can generate new scripts that are funnier than the originals by virtue of their sheer absurdity. Scottish cartoonist Andy Pandy set up such a bot, and posted several examples of its screenwriting prowess on Twitter over the weekend.
The bot does a good job simulating all the subtleties of Friends, like Chandler beginning sentences with “so,” and being “inside a muffin” (???), Joey talking in his famous “curling voice” (???), everyone crying and shouting about babies, and guest star Jean-Claude Van Damme.
And computer-generated banter like “Yeah!” “Okay!” “Okay.” “Yeah!” really captures the Kauffman/Crane dialogue magic that kept the show running for 15 seasons. With the ability for algorithms to iterate infinitely (and websites to capitalize on nostalgia), it could run for 15 more, online.
British YouTuber Sam Pepper, best-known to non–YouTube teenagers for a prank video in which he appeared to non-consensually grab women’s butts as they stopped to give him directions on the street, posted a lengthy, blurry video to his now-empty account this morning in which he apologizes for many things, including making himself look like a “douche” and an “idiot” just to get more views on YouTube.
He said his explanation after backlash against the butt-grabbing video — that it was a “social experiment” — is “bullshit.” The crux of what he appears to be saying in the video is that really, he’s a great guy who just made some dumb videos and lost his massive fanbase.
He notably brushes off the multiple rapes he’s been accused of, while making a larger point that people hate him on the internet now, so of course fake rape allegations follow. In fact, they’re really inconveniencing his life; he had to tell his new girlfriend of four months that multiple women had accused him of sexually assaulting them, and no one wants to have to say that to their new girlfriend. “If I had done that,” he says, referring to raping multiple women, “I wouldn’t be sitting here now.” I don’t feel I need to link to statistics about how often men don’t get punished for raping women here.
He also called into a channel called Drama Alert, hosted by YouTuber Daniel Keem, to talk more about the rape allegations. “It was just a super shit time for me,” he told Keem, who is the subject of a Change.org petition asking YouTube to remove his channel for repeated incidents of racism. “What a stupid thing to have to say,” Pepper told Keem of having to explain the rape allegations. After the allegations were first reported by BuzzFeed, Keem uploaded a video defending Pepper.
Last November, Pepper found himself the subject of further YouTube drama when he pranked the Vine star Sam Golbach by pretending to murder Golbach’s best friend, Colby Brock, in front of Golbach.
Pepper ends his confessional video by saying he’s going to continue making videos for YouTube. “I know there’s still gonna be people who’ll say stuff,” he says, tearing up. “I know there’s still people that are gonna hate, but if I’ve done this [make an apology video] and then make content that I really believe in, at least I’ll feel a bit better about myself.”
A new report from Recode asserts that Twitter is planning to, in some way, expand posts on the social network past its famous 140-character limit, setting the stage for a product reportedly referred to internally as “Beyond 140.”
The main idea, according to Recode, is that tweets will initially display a quick 140 characters of text, and then contain some mechanism that allows posts to be expanded into more substantial pieces of content. The proposed new upper bound for these expanded posts is 10,000 characters, the limit that Twitter already uses for direct messages.
The move would keep in line with Twitter’s slow creep toward loading more media into your feed. It started with pictures and then expanded to video, GIFs, a native quoting feature, and Twitter Cards, which automatically previewed links to external content.
If you’re getting a slight sense of déjà vu regarding this news, it might be because Recode reported almost the same bit of news back at the end of September last year. Exactly when, or even if, this change will roll out is unclear. It’s also possibly analogous to Facebook’s Instant Articles program, which hosts publisher work directly rather than linking out, and therefore, this move likely means more for big publishers than it does for the average user.
Update 5:23 p.m.: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey shared this announcement a few minutes ago.
The final witness on Thursday in the lawsuit between Hulk Hogan and Gawker was a man named Kevin Blatt, a man who holds the distinction of being possibly the only sex-tape broker in the world. He was tied to, perhaps most famously, the tapes featuring Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian.
In a video deposition, Blatt shed a light on the many tactics for getting attention and getting paid that surround the cottage industry. Just the existence of a tape can lead to huge traffic. Part of Blatt’s deposition explains how “when somebody hears of a celebrity sex tape’s existence, people will then go online. They will try to buy up not only the URLs with the alleged celebrity name, but would also look for keywords” to optimize search-engine performance. The site Sex.com paid Blatt $3,000 to write a letter to Hogan soliciting the tape. The main goal of this was not to actually acquire the footage, but to gain attention for the website. People like these tapes, according to Blatt, because “in a lot of cases, it humanizes the celebrity. It brings them right down to where you and I are.” Tapes involving female celebrities are worth more. “If the celebrity is a female, it can be worth a lot of money. If it’s a male, traditionally it’s not worth as much.”
Blatt’s testimony is part of Hogan’s overall strategy to paint Gawker not as a journalistic outlet, but one that unethically invades celebrity privacy for vast financial gain. Earlier in the day, an expert witness in journalism was called upon to speak about how a “traditional” news outlet would never have published the footage.
The war over the Republican presidential nomination is being fought on many fronts: on the debate stage, on the ground in key states, and perhaps the most interesting battlefield of all: America’s Facebook newsfeeds. And candidates seem willing to go to extremes to win that last one: This week, Marco Rubio’s campaign accused Ted Cruz’s operation of dishonest and deceptive meme warfare.
With the South Carolina primary looming, a Facebook post has been circulating that suggests South Carolina representative Trey Gowdy — the Republican chair of the Benghazi committee — has switched his endorsement from Rubio to Cruz. But Gowdy hasn’t, The Wall Street Journal reports. He’s still “one of Mr. Rubio’s fiercest supporters who has appeared with him in close to a dozen events over the past several days.”
The fake post, from an account called Trey Gowdy Prayers — which has since been deleted — said, “My previous endorsement of Marco Rubio was a grave mistake,” and “I hereby formally endorse Ted Cruz for President of the United States.”
It was signed “Trey Gowdy Prayers,” but it read like an official statement, and the profile photo for the page was a headshot of Gowdy. While it didn’t explicitly claim to be a message from Gowdy, it’s easy to see how it could be confusing.
According to the Journal, Rubio’s campaign blames Cruz’s “operatives” for spreading the deceptive post.
Gowdy also issued a statement condemning the post, and called it “a systematic effort by Senator Cruz and his allies to spread false information.”
Cruz, whose campaign was also accused of deceiving Iowa voters into thinking that rival Ben Carson had dropped out of the race, responded to Gowdy on Twitter, writing, “Our campaign had absolutely nothing to do with this fraudulent Facebook post.”
GQ has managed to get a world-famous Massachusetts wrestler on the record to discuss a meme that intimately involves him, and — IT’S JOHN CENA!
The It’s John Cena meme, born out of a series of prank calls from last year that involved bombastic wrestler announcing and Cena’s anthem, is simple. Basically, take any clip of someone being introduced, replace them with John Cena, and start playing his song. Often the audio will be comically blown out.
When asked about it, Cena said:
“At the end of the day, I am overwhelmingly honored to interrupt such historic events.” Wonderful.
Texas plumber Mark Oberholtzer has been dealing with a public-relations headache for the last year after a truck bearing his business’s name ended up in the hands of ISIS. The truck was shown in ISIS Twitter feeds, outfitted with a mounted machine gun but still bearing the name and phone number of Oberholtzer’s Mark–1 Plumbing.
Oberholtzer is now suing AutoNation, the dealer he traded the truck in to, claiming that he was told the dealer would remove the decal. Last December, his business was the subject of hundreds of irate phone calls and threats, and he’s had to dig himself out of a hole on Yelp, where most of the reviews are now kind people rating him five stars out of sympathy.
In a statement to ABC News, AutoNation expressed sympathy for Oberholtzer but defended their process, saying, “The truck came in on trade and was immediately sent to auction. The auctions in most accounts will prep the vehicles. We have the paperwork that shows the steps the vehicle took.”

How is it possible that the same, stupid, transparent publicity stunt can “go viral” so many times over? For one thing, the audience for content on the internet is so huge, and the slough of content so voluminous, that it doesn’t really matter: You will always find someone who hasn’t encountered the “Vivid Offers $1 Million to” story before.
But really my guess is that no one is particularly interested in the content of the stunt, anyway; generally, I’d bet that stories about Miss Colombia being offered a porn deal aren’t shared because people believe there’s some news value to them but because the story itself is a convenient shell for a set of opinions. Link on Facebook and let us know what you think of this woman! Is she too good for porn? Too ugly for porn? Would you like to see her in a porn? It’s not an accident that the women who are the recipients of these offers tend to be in the same category: on the precipice of national fame but not widely beloved. (In some sense, they’re famous for being available to have judgment passed upon them, in a way that actresses and singers just aren’t.)
There’s a whole category of “news story” where time doesn’t matter because the intrinsic value of the content isn’t in its newsworthiness but in its share-worthiness. The question is not Is this something I need to know? but Is this something I have a strong opinion about? This is how four-year-old videos about, e.g., vajazzling become newly viral. And how Vivid gets away with making the same offer over and over again, and still getting covered in the news.
Also, these offer letters are always leaked to TMZ! Vivid should do an internal audit.
A woman is in the news, which means porn production company Vivid Entertainment is offering her $1 million to “do porn.” Facebook’s “Trending Topics” bar greeted me this morning with the news that Vivid founder Steve Hirsch has offered — ”[i]n a letter leaked to TMZ,” the Daily News reports — Miss Colombia Ariadna Gutierrez, who was mistakenly and briefly named the winner of the Miss Universe pageant on Sunday night, $1 million “to make a sex tape.” How many times can we read this story?
Among the women Vivid has offered $1 million (or more) for a porn contract:

Saying you’re so aloof you find everything ludicrous is the platonic symptom of being mad. It’s a natural response to getting owned. In fact, it has a classical precedent, in 2 Samuel 6.
After Saul dies, King David ascends the throne and wins a major battle. He celebrates by getting naked and giving everyone in Israel raisins (the past really sucked). Saul’s daughter Michal is unhappy: “How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today, going around half-naked in full view of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!” she says. In other words: “Actually, I find this funny.” Seeing through her, David reminds her that God chose him, not her loser dad. Then Michal dies without children.
What it means: I’m not mad at all … nope, not one bit. That crushing feeling inside when I contemplate the thousands of strangers telling me I’m an awful person … that’s actually funny to me.
Modern precedents: In modern times there are innumerable examples of this phony rolling-with-the-punches, from pharmaceutical price-gouger Martin Shkreli to, uh, ISIS, who called Anonymous “idiots” and nerds in response to the latter declaring cyberwar on the terrorist organization:
The rest of that missive included basic advice on password security, indicating that ISIS wasn’t threatened or mad at all by these digital vigilantes. Anonymous, meanwhile, claims they’ve dismantled 149 ISIS websites and flagged 100,000 ISIS twitter accounts.
“Actually, You’re the One Who’s Mad”
“Actually, you’re mad” is a version of the classic, rhetorically sophisticated comeback “I’m rubber, you’re glue.” This one is the white-belt level of “who’s mad?” martial arts — a simple reversal that will confuse only the most mad.
What it means: Not everyone is on the internet 24/7 like you pathetic nerds. Some people go to the gym, or have sex with our hot wives, or just go outside and enjoy the beautiful day free of trolls. If anything, the real losers are the ones who are criticizing me.
In November 2003, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly invited the rapper Cam’ron to The O’Reilly Factor. As Cam’ron and his manager Dame Dash defended their music to O’Reilly, the segment grew somewhat heated. Cam’ron, laughing, pointed his finger at O’Reilly, and, in a singsong voice, unleashed a grievous insult: “You mad.”
Precedents: @WillMcAvoyACN, an account dedicated to role-playing as a character from the canceled show The Newsroom, absolutely isn’t mad when someone tells him he sucks — if anything, his several tweets written with the breathless gravitas of an Aaron Sorkin screenplay indicate that actually it’s his haters who are wrong.
“My Hot Wife Thinks This Is Funny”
Sometimes you don’t need to tell people explicitly that you’re not mad. Sometimes you just need to let them know how freakin’ great your life is and they’ll understand. How can a guy with a wife this hot, a watch this expensive, a car this clearly a compensation mechanism be mad?
What it means: While you trolls living in your mom’s basement have been obsessing over me, I’ve been out riding my Maserati with my hot *Asian* wife, who agrees with me that you guys are a bunch of losers that I don’t even have time to care about since I’m so busy pumping iron at the gym at my *Fortune 500* company office.
Precedents: The exemplar of this genre is conservative pundit Kurt Schlichter. Just search “from:@KurtSchlichter model wife” or “from:@KurtSchlichter model wife” on Twitter and you’ll be treated to some gems:
“Clearly, You Suffer From Clinical Wrongness”
Because of hourlong criminal dramas, the dumbest people alive think that they’re psychological profilers. It’s a fun illusion of authority of knowledge for some to repeat probably incorrect psychological causations they heard an actor say, but online, it’s a last resort.
Cam’ron’s immortal words have since been adopted by the internet at large as the cool, detached comeback to anyone who lets it be known that someone online has gotten to them. For many (normal) people, being mad is a natural consequence of impassioned debate. Why argue for hours if you’re not going to be emotionally invested in something? But for a certain species of internet user, the question is reversed: Why be emotionally invested in anything you might argue about?
If you can’t find anything in a person’s argument, or make fun of their picture, or find a really sad post they made previously about their loved one leaving them, all you can do is offer useless diagnoses of their various brain disorders. This technique is widely used by minor notable people, who are extremely close to telling their trolls “it seems you have a case of psychology, buddy.” “This is classic projection” is a telltale sign someone is very angry.
What it means: What, were you not hugged enough in the womb? I’m not here to give you free psychiatric care. Not that I couldn’t afford it.
Precedents:
“Dance, Puppets, Dance”
One way to assert authority when you’re mad is to say this entire time you’ve merely been pretending to be terrible, perhaps as a social experiment or for your own amusement.
What it means: Oh, you thought I was actually an unforgivably vile human being? Well, idiot, in fact I was performing a social experiment which exposed you as the bad person. Clearly you’re too much of an ignoramus to understand the scientific value of screaming the N-word in a debate about video games.
Precedents: According to secondary sources, this one may also have Biblical roots, this time in Exodus. Totally not mad from the death of his son and destruction of his crops, Pharaoh likely told Moses that he would let the Israelites go. However, when he caught up to them at the Red Sea, it is extremely likely that he claimed this was all part of his plan. Of course, he got destroyed by YHWH immediately after, which shows a guy who admits he’s mad will always beat a mad guy who tries to hide it.
In the modern context, this is a classic form of ass-covering after ill-conceived marketing campaigns go awry.
Online, it’s acceptable to argue for eight hours straight about circumcision or video-game breast sizes, resolutely backing yourself into insane rhetorical and logical corners. But you can only truly lose the argument by being “mad” — in other words, by admitting that some other blank-faced loudmouth has taken up enough space in your head to command anything but mirth or indifference. Displaying real emotion on the web is verboten — it shows that an anonymous troll has gotten under your skin, that a handful of words adjacent to a silhouette of an egg have ruined your day. Even as the skin on your neck grows red and primal rage overcomes your sense of control, you can never admit defeat.
In 2012, the National Republican Congressional Committee set up a live-stream of a printer making copies of a petition to repeal Obamacare, which supporters could sign online. Of course, people found it and signed it with names like “Piss Children,” “Boner Junkmonkey,” and “Joseph Goebbels.” For an hour, viewers watched as “Weedlord Bonerhitler” and “HelpI’mStuckInthisPrinter” declared their desire to roll back the Affordable Care Act; at some point, a disembodied hand started reaching into the feed to rip out offensive entries before the feed was cut off. Was the NRCC mad? “We were all sitting around watching it, laughing hysterically,” claimed their digital director. Indeed, it was their plan all along to have their serious petitions signed by the likes of “Detective Rex Hardbody” and “Pointless Empty Gesture.”

Suppose you eke out a living writing noxiously stupid yet sincere blog posts with titles like “Trigger Warnings Caused ISIS” or “Miracle Urine Supplements Raised My T-Levels,” and suppose you wake up to find your articles have been passed around by online jokesters and now thousands of strangers are commenting on how you have the physique of a drinking-bird desk toy. If you had self-esteem you’d probably be upset, but instead you’re elated because your blog is getting thousands of clicks, and your Twitter mentions are full, and your thoughts are being shared far and wide (albeit by people who just want to make fun of you). All publicity is good publicity, right?
This tactic is notoriously abused by weirdo men’s-rights activists and right-wing clickbait writers who revel in the success of their intricate plot to become social media’s bête noire by calling Lena Dunham fat.
What it means: Wow, blowing up my mentions like all my other fans. Guess you must have really loved this one, huh? My wife thanks you for the traffic, she’s been really wanting that new couch. Anyway, I gotta go to the gym, but please try to contain your love for me.
Precedents: None — we don’t want to give them any traffic.
“Put Your Location On / Say It to My Face”
The internet works great because you can say whatever nasty thing you want without someone beating the shit out of you. But if you make the wrong keyboard commando upset you might be invited to duke it out mano a mano.
What it means: Well, you know where I am. I’d love to see you back everything up in person, which I know you won’t.
Precedents: There’s Jose Canseco, whose brain has presumably been destroyed from years of steroid abuse, demanding to fight a seven-foot-one Shaq. There’s this guy who drove a half hour to Temecula, California, to fight a total stranger on Christmas Day because they were arguing about Kobe Bryant on Twitter.
Then there’s former Business Insider CTO Pax Dickinson, whose first response after being outed as a raging bigot was to demand tech writer and critic Anil Dash tell him he’s an asshole to his face. Dickinson was fired a day after that, but apparently they indeed met for chocolates.
“Cease and Desist This Libel, Slander, and Defamation Per Se”
Baseless legal threats — or lolsuits — are a classic response to being insulted online. To a certain kind of bully, particularly one with no background in law, the legal system is either a blunt weapon to be wielded against trolls or a casino with easy payouts against anyone who calls you an asshole. Sometimes they make good on their threats, as actor James Woods famously did this year, suing an anonymous Twitter user for $10 million in a probably doomed case.
What it means: My lawyer will be happy to see this. Yeah, keep talking. You’ll see how “worth it” this all was in court. I wonder how funny it will all be then. Pretty funny, but for me, actually.
Precedents: Humor website Something Awful has a section devoted to specious legal threats from people they’ve rankled over the years. In one exchange, someone representing retired WWF star the Ultimate Warrior threatens to sue over a post calling the wrestler a racist. When the site’s owner, Rich “Lowtax” Kyanka, responds dismissively, the representative tracks down Lowtax’s address, calls his father (?!), and writes:
Speaking of little man, I’ve also managed to track down a couple of pictures of you, which I’ve attached to this email. You should really spend less time typing away at your computer and a little more time in the gym. Those arms of yours look like spaghetti. And those rosy-red cheeks of yours are quite manly, as well.
Some accounts go one step further and draft their own laws. When the Steak-umm brand of questionable meat product blocked Twitter user Weedlord Bonerhitler in 2014, their 700-follower account was deluged with invective from angry internet jerks demanding justice. In response Steak-umm blocked hundreds of critics then promulgated a 1,300-word manifesto of rules for interacting with them on social media, featuring such injunctions as “don’t be a fake” and “don’t spread lies and rumors about Steak-umm or our competitors.” Fair warning: When you log on, you’re all under Steak-umm’s jurisdiction.
“Everybody, Look at How Not Mad I Am!”
As such, people who get mad online employ a set of surprisingly universal responses to show how totally unaffected they are. These are the flimsy suits of armor donned by narcissists with big egos and little tolerance for criticism or self-awareness: In other words, assholes who have been owned online.
If a tree isn’t mad in a forest and no one is around to witness it — does it make a sound? It’s one thing to let an antagonist know that you’re totally not mad, but sometimes you need to let everyone else know, too. Hence the practice of retweeting insults, or including a period before the handle of the person you’re arguing with (or putting the handle at the end of the tweet): Why shouldn’t all of your followers be aware of how totally not mad you are?
From Robert Evans writing a memoir about how he’s not mad at Francis Ford Coppola to cub reporter Milo Yiannopoulos threatening to dox something called the “Shit Account tournament,” those with megaphones will use them to show they’re so far above it all that they’ll let their audience laugh along with them!
What it means: Seriously, fans, check this one out — it actually made me laugh. +1 to you, anonymous virgin troll.
Precedents: A habitual practitioner of this is noted hack @TheTweetOfGod, who periodically sifts through his Twitter mentions to find haters to retweet to his audience of 2 million neurosurgeons and astrophysicists:
After a few minutes, God in His infinite wisdom will delete the retweet to keep His timeline focused on such gems as “Donald Trump would tell Barabbas ‘You’re fired!’” Despite doing this constantly, David Javerbaum, the voice of God, definitely isn’t mad, as evinced by this totally normal direct message he sent someone:
“I Am Not Mad and Nude”
This is a landmark innovation in being mad. On the 26th of December, 2014, a man named @ScottyBurberry got so enraged during an argument about the merits of beer versus vodka he responded in this way:
As internet jerks who are no stranger to trolling, we have compiled the following taxonomy of responses to being mad.
To date, there has been no one else who has done this in earnest online. The totally unique and evocative experience of ripping your clothes off because you’re so furious at the trolls has caught fire, however. Almost two years on, people are still enamored by the concept. It’s also subject to an unforgettable tribute from Twitter user @_Snackman:
“I Actually Find This Funny”
A Dungeons & Dragons player found himself in big trouble recently. Bear with us, here: His druid character had grown quite attached to a pet donkey, but the Dungeon Master apparently had it in for the poor animal, and kept concocting plans to take its life. “Help,” our druid begged Reddit’s D&D forum. They had to save the donkey.
Unfortunately, the quest might just be futile. The Dungeon Master is the all-powerful arbiter of the game’s plot. The players can only control their own characters, but the DM has carte blanche to take the lives of innocent, non-player donkeys. But if the druid can’t protect his asinine friend, you can be damn sure he’ll avenge it.
The top response to his plea is an elaborate step-by-step plan for getting revenge on the Dungeon Master by gradually growing more powerful and, instead of cooperating with the campaign as planned, burning the whole game world down in the donkey’s name. It’s a stunning and poetic prescription for retribution that begins with “intimidation” and ends in “everlasting night.”
This Dungeon Master is going to rue the day he decided to mess with his player’s favorite ass.
The listicle is the native format of the Internet. It’s easy to understand. It has prescribed limits, perfect for social media’s tiny attention span. Like all good viral content, it has an inherent structure that leaves readers wanting just a little more (what could item number 38 possibly be???). And it’s addictive. Reading one listicle simply prepares us for for more, until all of our content must be consumed in numerical catalogs. Hence the utility of Wikipedia’s lists, lists of lists, and lists thereof, lists to the third and fourth power.
These meta-lists are field guides to the Internet’s sheer deluge of facts. If anything that matters can be found online, it can be found here. The human-powered encyclopedia generates the greatest volume of listicles of our age, surpassing even the seedier sections of BuzzFeed in output. The “best lists” list (a list of lists) on Wikipedia includes such esoterica as “Caribbean membranophones,” ancient documents that qualify as national treasures of Japan, and “friends of friendless churches.” Two of my favorites are the list of megalithic monuments (huge stone structures) and the list of largest monoliths in the world (single stone blocks).
Then there’s the epic List of Lists of Lists. It lists lists of other lists, like “Lists of characters from The Office” and “Lists of road junctions in the United States.” These items, of course, are broken out into further subsections, by place, or genre, or theme. “Lists of horses” no doubt lists of breeds of horses, but it sounds like it could be a list of every horse that has ever existed, which Wikipedia, in its boundless decentralized knowledge, has somehow compiled. On the list of lists of lists, there’s a list of lists of Crayola crayon colors that no doubt contains many more hues than the rainbow, as well as the metadata needed to categorize them.
The Lists^3 forms a Borgesian infinite folder hierarchy in which lists list other lists, which are in turn collected on still larger lists. Directories of lists. Compendia of lists. Card catalogs of lists. Archives of lists. Glass tanks filled with dioramas of ancient lists, molding in the dark, untouched. Lists^3 even lists itself.
Nothing is very obscure on the Internet, but these lists on lists must be among the least-accessed pages. It’s not because they’re not useful, it’s more because on the Internet, we’re used to traveling directly to the object we’re seeking rather than navigating so many layers. But we are able to do that precisely because the Internet is made of so many lists, indices that tell us which websites are important, which software is appropriate, and which data we’ve already consumed. Actual lists, well beyond the tired archetype of the viral listicle, are unsung heroes of the Web.
At the top of the “List of lists of lists” page, Wikipedia gnomically informs us that the list is incomplete, unlike the presumed finality of “27 Puppies Who Are Too Cute To Be Real.” The warning really only serves as a reminder that nothing is ever finished. If this inspires feelings of general despair, you’re not alone. It’s enough to make anyone a little listless.
News organizations are no longer the masters of their own distribution; over half of Facebook and Twitter users get their news from those platforms, a percentage that’s only increasing. Digital media doesn’t deteriorate; the physical cues that might help a reader immediately figure out the age of a given story are gone. This can help those news organizations reach a wider audience, but it also means that each article or video is now forced to be a stand-alone unit of consumable content, rather than one component of an entire newspaper or magazine. Stripped of context, stories exist eternally, forever available, forever relevant. What’s really at stake isn’t social media’s relationship to time — it’s news’ relationship to it.
In the wake of a tragedy like the attacks in Paris last week, you can expect to encounter certain kinds of things on Twitter and Facebook: somber tributes, breaking news stories, righteous videos that express your reactions. What you can also expect is that many of those things, all pegged to the same recent event, will be months — or even years — old.
In the days after the attacks, two stories rapidly began to circulate on Facebook: a 2014 video of Iranian-American scholar Reza Aslan on CNN disputing comments made by comedian Bill Maher regarding ISIS and Islam, and a BBC news story from April of this year about Al Shabaab militants storming a Kenyan university, killing 147 people. Both the video and the news story have gone viral; last Sunday, the Kenya attack was the most-clicked article on the BBC website, garnering 10 million page views over two days — almost four times as many as when the story was originally published.
Now that social media is the dominant place for news to be reported, distributed, consumed, analyzed, and discussed, its odd relationship to time is becoming more and more apparent. The canonical example might be the ever-recurring death of Nigerian author Chinua Achebe: In March of this year, Twitter resounded with grief over Achebe’s death, reported in the the New York Times. The only problem: Achebe died on March 22, 2013, exactly two years prior, a date clearly stated in the article.
Joshua Benton at Harvard’s Nieman Lab tried to track down the originator of the 2015 redux, to no avail. But he offered up some theories about why it popped up again. Benton suggests that social media is fundamentally “unstuck in time” — not just because old stories are being shared by mistake, but because the endless space of the internet allows Facebook and other publishers to resurrect old stories hoping for renewed interest and clicks. “The stream metaphor of Twitter and Facebook drops the illusion of chronology,” he wrote, “and its relentless flow makes it inevitable that we’ll miss things along the way.”
But it’s not just that social media finds time mostly irrelevant. It’s that we do, too. Aslan’s stirring defense of Muslims may have been recorded in response to a Maher comment from last year, but it remains relevant. The anti-Muslim argument remains the same, making Aslan’s impassioned retort just as applicable. Why does it matter that it’s a few months old? While it is likely that many who shared the video last week thought it was new, its resurfacing this week could only have happened from others remembering it and finding renewed relevance in its message.
This was, in fact, one of the reasons that the BBC article about Kenya resurfaced so quickly. It seems to have gotten its initial bump from people who, with full knowledge of its date, wanted to make the point that Western media wasn’t covering non-Western countries as prominently as they were Paris. But then, of course, it was picked up by people who weren’t aware that it was months old.
In this sense, the temporality of social media seems odd only because of its multiple uses. When we think of Twitter or Facebook as newswires — sources of new information — it becomes odd to see old or out-of-date content. But when they’re thought of as places for discussion and gathering, it makes perfect sense that old-but-still-relevant information and arguments would be shared — as they often are in offline discussion. As Facebook seeks to mediate all online behavior, it will have increasing difficulty adequately communicating to people the contexts of each piece of content: Is this a piece of news? A remembered argument? Both? Neither?
This is, ultimately, why you can always expect to see resurrected zombie content lumbering across your feeds: Because Facebook and Twitter now mediate your relationship to news, not newspapers or magazines. As the BBC itself pointed out, the Kenya shooting was written about, and often — but that’s not the same thing as people seeing it. As internet users, we exist in echo chambers, where what we see reflects the interests and beliefs we already hold. With the aid of social-media platforms, we create echo chambers for ourselves, based on who we choose to friend and follow, the links we click on, what we choose to read. It’s a game of association, based on who we associate with online, as well as the thematic associations between types of content. News agencies and aggregators alike vie for access to our echo chambers, with inevitable overlap, delays, and resurrections of content. Republishing old stories is part of the landscape and, when it comes to social media, considered crucial to success.
(For context.)
The Iowa caucus is just the first step in the long election slog that will be 2016. Our modern world is rife with complex and tricate issues that often overlap with each other in concerning ways. There are tons of issues at stake this year: economic inequality, ISIS, civil rights, Jet Skis, the fast-casual dining experience at Olive Garden.
It’s a lot to process. Luckily, Democrats have simplified the process with a simple graphic laying out the policy differences between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Bernie’s got some unconventional stances, to be sure, while Hillary is fun.
This past summer, the Cruz campaign quietly uploaded more than a dozen hours of footage to YouTube. Presented in segments ranging anywhere from 24 minutes to more than an hour long, they contain unedited video from ad shoots for presidential campaign videos. What comes across is a bizarro campaign ad, full of awkward pauses, multiple takes, and uncomfortable hugs.
As CNN explains it, the footage exists because campaign regulations prohibit candidates from coordinating directly with their political action committees. That makes it difficult if a PAC wants to, for example, produce a television ad featuring footage of the candidate. The campaign can’t supply it.
In order to provide PACs with footage, candidates will sometimes upload b-roll to public sites like YouTube, allowing the PACs to obtain footage for their own use. Last year, Iowa Democratic representative Bruce Braley uploaded three “ads” that featured nothing but stock footage of himself set to elevator music. Less than a month later, the liberal Senate Majority PAC had produced an ad using the footage.
So that’s why we have 15 hours of mostly boring, occasionally revealing footage of Ted Cruz and his extended family. It’s a lot of campaign sausage being made, but there are some moments of tension. The L.A. Times highlights this exchange between Cruz and his mother, Eleanor Darragh, hesitant to discuss certain aspects of their family life.
The footage also includes “details about Cruz’s father’s alcoholism, his stepsister’s drug abuse, and Cruz’s gambling debts.”
It’s also why there’s six minutes of slo-mo b-roll of Cruz and his family sitting on a dock.
Despite accidentally uploading the wrong version to SoundCloud at first, Kanye West successfully released a new track this afternoon. It can also be heard over at kanyewest.com, which has been overhauled as a simple landing page that plays the song. The only image on the page is one of young West playing keyboard.
However, as one visitor pointed out on Twitter, a peek at the page’s source code reveals a cool Easter egg, that same image rendered as ASCII art.
You can check it out for yourself on any desktop browser, though the process of revealing a page’s source code varies by browser (on Chrome add “view-source:” before the URL).
Luckily, this has a happy ending. Hendren told me that he and Thorpe have reconciled and that his personal brand is still very strong. He wrote:
White Zin. Amazing. Glad this story has a happy ending.
Insulting a friend’s shoes is one of the true pleasures of existence, as anyone can tell you, but only on Twitter has it been elevated to an art form. We’ll all remember the Great Shoe Roast of 2015. Where were you when @Arr took on @Fart? Obviously, you know what I’m talking about, but to refresh your memory …
On February 20, 2015, Twitter user @fart (real name: Jon Hendren) tweeted this picture:
What followed was a disaster. Many made fun of the bad shoes. Ferocious tweets flew at Hendren left and right, mainly coming from users @Arr and @weedguy420boner.
The entire saga is incredible, a drubbing of epic proportions. That Hendren survived at all is amazing. You can read the whole Storify here; it goes on for months and was recently revived:
An astonishing roasting for sure. Reached for comment @Arr (real name: David Thorpe) passed along the following message, explaining how the roasting was accomplished.
In retrospect, we should have expected this. The iconic opening crawl of Star Wars is so well-known, and so easily manipulable, that it was inevitable that people would find a way to riff on it.
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away …
STAR WARS
[cue John Williams score]
You’re getting excited just thinking about it.
And then …
Lucasfilm itself made it extremely easy by supplying its own Star Wars Crawl Creator. And so the web got to work, forging new memes from the rough, unrefined cyberore.
A photo of a little boy wearing a Lionel Messi soccer shirt made from a plastic bag warmed hearts around the world last week, but attempts to locate “Messi’s biggest fan” and hear his story initially fell flat. A rumor that the boy lived in Iraq turned out to be a hoax, and reporters hit a dead end. That is, until Tuesday, when the BBC located the Messi Kid — 5-year-old Murtaza Ahmadi — in rural Afghanistan.
Last week’s hoax fooled Kurdistan TV into thinking that a boy named Homin, living in Dohuk, Iraq, was the same boy in the photo, but it turned out to be a false lead from a Swedish high-school student on Twitter, the BBC’s Trending blog reported. The tipster, @IllMindofRobin, later confessed that he started the Dohuk rumor because he has family there and “wanted to draw attention to the town.”
But that false tip provided the lead that eventually led to the real Messi kid, Murtaza.
The BBC “heard about Murtaza after his uncle contacted @illMindOfRobin to tell him that his nephew was the real boy in the photo,” they reported.
Murtaza lives in Ghazni, in rural eastern Afghanistan, and his father, “a simple farmer,” couldn’t afford to buy him the jersey of his favorite player. So Murtaza and his brothers made their own using what they had: the plastic bag.
It was Murtaza’s older brother Hamayon who put the famous photos on Facebook.
According to his dad, Murtaza is now aware that he’s an internet sensation, and he loves it. He hopes this fame helps his family meet Lionel Messi, and hopes that, in the future, he can be a good football player like his hero.
But before all that, he’s certainly going to get his own Messi jersey from one of the many news outlets that has been trying to find him.
Teens and college kids clearly love Down to Lunch — otherwise it wouldn’t be so popular. But it’s not just its weirdly passive and spammy approach to communication that’s making it a hit. Down to Lunch’s pushy invite tactics (nearly every screen on the app puts you one button away from texting your address book to join the app) are likely the biggest reason it’s climbed the app charts so quickly. Need more proof? Down to Lunch has also already started to piss some people off, a sure sign of an aggressive growth strategy.
Take a look. A quick Twitter search for “Down to Lunch” yields plenty of people overwhelmed by invitations to join the app. If you remember the Farmville game notifications that plagued Facebook during the early aughts, these complaints might feel a little familiar.
When I downloaded DTL, the app also prompted me to invite people to join from my contacts, based on the number of friends they’d have if they joined. Suggestions included my former boss and the CMO of a popular tech start-up.
I declined.
For now I think I’ll be sticking with text-messaging my lunch plans or just eating a sad desk salad.
Finding somebody to have lunch with in 2016 can be a challenge. These days, there are just so few options for communicating with other humans and nailing down meal plans. Right? Right.
Enter Down to Lunch, an app that launched in 2015 and has since grown in popularity thanks to college students across the country — and to its aggressive, gamified invite strategy. On Friday, DTL edged out Facebook’s Messenger app for the third spot in the free category of the Apple App Store, as first noted by Business Insider.
The app, which creators Joseph Lau and Nikil Viswanathan built in a single One Direction–fueled afternoon, is extremely simple to use, just like, uh, texting. It connects to your phone contacts and notifies your friends in the area that you’re “down to lunch.” If anyone responds with interest, you can then use the app to chat and firm up plans. (Student users can also select a school to help find classmates using the app.)
It’s not limited to just grabbing a noontime nosh. Other choices include “Breakfast,” “Ball,” “Gym,” and, every millennial’s favorite pastime, “Chill.” Down to Lunch also offers a few less-PG options, like “Blaze” and “Beer Pong,” but — unfortunately for the loner beer-pong enthusiast — those are only open to users who have a set number of friends using the app.
It’s a pretty brilliant strategy. If you’re hoping to use DTL to find some pals to blaze up with on 4/20, you’ll need to recruit 50 people to download the app before then.
On the other end, the “Church” option doesn’t have any requirements, so hit up your good pal Hozier and go to town.
Sure, these messages would be easy to fake, but I want to believe that they’re real. If you look at the timestamps, you’ll notice Lucy’s brother waits several minutes in between replies — valuable minutes he was probably using to pull the perfect response from the Hannibal Lecter quotes page on IMDb.
Remarkable boy. I do admire his courage.
In our strange contemporary world, technology enables all kinds of new and uncomfortable ways for strangers to get access to us. And because necessity is the mother of invention and all that, it also provides new ways to blow those strangers off. For example: A woman who goes by Lucy2Shoes says she gave an undesirable guy at the bar her brother’s number instead of her own, and her brother has a penchant for answering texts with lines from infamous fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter.
“Every now and again I come across men at bars who won’t take no for an answer,” “Lucy” wrote on imgur.
“Doesn’t matter that I tell them I’m not interested, I have a boyfriend, we own a home together, I’m never leaving him, I just want to hang out with my friends, so on and so forth. After failed attempts to get rid of them, I usually can get them to leave me alone if I give them my number. So, I give them my big brother’s. For this gentleman, my brother decided to only respond with Hannibal Lecter quotes.”
It is important, as Hannibal’s mother used to tell him, to try new things.
The best part of their exchange is that the earnest would-be suitor takes forever to get the joke. The poor guy tries his best to make sense of the ravings of an erudite cannibal, and just keeps responding, thinking he’s met a girl who might be too “deep” for him. It’s painful and hilarious to see.
Look at the form: no greeting, no signature, just to-the-point answers that cut through all the formality. Writing a greeting and a sign-off are the most annoying parts of writing email, and Jeb is just like, “No, thank you! Email formality is dead.” Jeb gets it.
I reached out to Jeb, asking whether he preferred the Xbox One or the PlayStation 4. So far, no response.
Yesterday, Jeb Bush told a bunch of kids to email him at jeb@jeb.org. A silly publicity stunt, yes, but also a way to make new friends: It appears that he (or someone representing him) is actually responding to voter questions, regardless of how pertinent they are to the campaign.
And he’s really good at it! Certainly much better than he is at debating, or running for the Republican presidential nomination. One Gawker reader managed to get into an email chain with Jeb, who revealed that he prefers turkey jerky on the campaign trail, specifically the original variety. Writer Sam Biddle was also able to get a question to Jeb, revealing that the former Florida governor is not familiar with Pepe, the meme frog.
Twitter user @dogboner also confirmed to Following that he received a response from Jeb: “i accidentally sent it from my work email. i was driving.” Asked to predict who would win the presidency in 2016, Jeb predicted Republican candidate Jeb Bush would be the winner.
Other people are posting about similar experiences. (We have not confirmed that these responses are actually from Jeb.)
One Longhorns fan was able to get Jeb on the record stating that Charlie Strong would be able to reverse the team’s fortunes.
The “Hillary vs. Bernie on the Issues” meme of February 2016 sped through its entire internet life cycle very quickly: It started out in real life as a prank by Tumblr comedian Jeff “Pleated Jeans” Wysaski, blew up on Twitter, got parodied to hell and back, and was decried as sexist in some flaming-hot Takes. And now, just a few days after it popped up, it has evolved into its final form: a really good Twitter bot called @foodie_dems.
Foodie Democrats, created by Casey Kolderup, automatically generates Hillary vs. Bernie posters using the text of restaurant reviews on Yelp. And because Yelpers tend to be insufferable snobs, they can be very funny. For example, how do the candidates compare on the Flying Falafel?
Or San Francisco’s rapidly expanding coffee institution, Blue Bottle?
There are dozens more of these.
I understand that these posters are algorithmically generated, and that Yelp reviews of one location tend to cluster around a consensus, but I can’t help noticing an (unintentional?) allegory here: Foodie Hillary and Bernie just aren’t tremendously far apart on the big issues.
Overall, good bot. Great service. Four and a half stars.
Every track except for the first one on this torrent was a bait and switch. Tracks two through five cut to — as far as I can tell — random Seinfeld audio, such as the shrinkage discussion. After that, thing got more diverse. Included in the fake-outs is audio from Chappelle’s Show, Caddyshack, the Garfield cartoon, The Big Lebowski, Half-Baked, Pulp Fiction, Cheech and Chong, and an old report about Jamaicans attempting to smuggle pot. “Our Deal” cuts out to some audio of a doo-wop song about pot that I was unable to identify.
I have, for years, attempted to find out who would do this and why. It’s such a weird prank; really just a minor inconvenience (says the guy writing about it six years later). The user who uploaded the torrent, Barnaby123, has not uploaded anything else to the Pirate Bay, and I have been unable to definitively confirm that other users named Barnaby123 on other sites are the same person. I’m inclined to believe that it is a throwaway account.
But I have some other theories.
Last May, Bethany Cosentino, Best Coast’s singer and one-half of the band, held an AMA on Reddit. In her kickoff post, she wrote, “I am so excited to be chatting with you guys today answering all of your questions about the record, the inspiration behind it and our love of California. Or we can talk about Seinfeld, astrology, macaroni and cheese — whatever your heart’s desire, I am here to chat with you about it!” (Emphasis added.)
The thread was titled, “Seinfeld Nights- a Reddit AMA with Bethany from Best Coast in honor of the new album California Nights!” A year prior, Cosentino had conducted an interview with Stereogum about how much she loved the show.
Given that four of the fake Best Coast tracks featured Seinfeld, I dug into the other audio clips on the show.
In October of 2014, Cosentino gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly, all about her cat, Snacks. Asked how she picked the name, Cosentino said, “I think I had the name already thought up, because I’m really into Garfield. This is really cheesy, but I feel whenever I read Garfield comics, I relate to them. I’m like, ‘Oh, that’s super relatable to the kind of person I am.’ And so I imagined whatever cat I had would be sort of similar to me-slash-Garfield.” (Emphasis added.)
Hhhmmmmmmmmmm. Garfield audio is used on three of the fake tracks.
Here’s Cosentino at Terminal 5 six weeks ago, performing in a Garfield mascot-head.
It might be difficult for some to remember, but six years ago there was no on-demand streaming service in the United States. There was Pandora, which mimicked radio, but if you wanted to actually hear an album you had to buy it. Or, more likely, you pirated it.
I emailed Best Coast’s PR last November, asking if Cosentino or someone close to her was involved in this bizarre not-actually-a-leak, and received no answer. In a follow-up earlier today, I was told that they didn’t have an answer for me.
Which leaves us right back where we started. Who would go to extraordinary lengths to orchestrate this bizarre prank? Who would go through the trouble of cutting together audio, making sure that all of the file metadata looked legit? The torrent was uploaded nearly four weeks ahead of the album’s official release. Was someone trying to mess with people looking for leaks? Was that person … Cosentino herself?
We may never know.
Update: Cosentino responds.
Sometime in the latter half of 2010, I pirated what I believed was a copy of Best Coast’s 2010 debut album, Crazy for You. (This was very rude of me and I apologize.) I was a sophomore in college, and many of my friends liked the song “When I’m With You,” the album’s breakout single. I went to the Pirate Bay, undoubtedly the biggest torrent directory on the web, and grabbed a torrent uploaded by a user named Barnaby123. I downloaded what looked to be Crazy for You. All 13 tracks were included, and all of the track lengths corresponded with official listings for the album.
Then it got weird.
The album’s opening track, “Boyfriend,” plays without a problem, but all of the other tracks cut out after roughly ten seconds. What plays next is emphatically not Best Coast.
“Thanks, but no thanks,” user capteeth commented on the torrent. “You get to hear about a 10 second clip of each song, before the Seinfeld sound bites come in.”
“don’t download, sullied with seinfeld,” writes ghostfacevanilla.
“I think the first track is complete. After that, it’s filled with Seinfeld audio,” says TraumaHound. “That’s disappointing, to say the least.”
Today, anime fan and fashion designer Kanye West got into a fight with the Pittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa. Wiz was annoyed that Kanye named his next album Waves (Wiz felt it was disrespectful to another rapper, Max B, known for his fondness for the word and concept “wavy”). Kanye, for his part, was mad that Wiz Khalifa is tall and wears cool pants (Kanye has a lot going on). Who won the fight? Well: On Instagram, Wiz is now being inundated with wave and jean emoji.
Not wavy.
While #blacklivesmatter first gained momentum in August 2014 when Mike Brown was shot and killed in Ferguson, Missouri, the hashtag and associated keywords often enter long lulls in between incidents. In fact, Officer Darren Wilson’s non-indictment generated more discussion than the initial shooting did in August. The Wilson decision in November 2014 generated nearly twice the amount of activity than any other major incident. Though activists have continually kept the issues in the news, major incidents — shootings as well as indictment decisions — generate levels of discussion magnitudes greater than what occurs on an average day.
The sentiment of those tweets was also largely supportive of the movement. Though the researcher refrained from offering specific statistics (sentiment analysis is a dicey area, especially on Twitter), they did find that “the vast majority of highly-retweeted messages supported the movement in some respect.”
One clear takeaway from the analysis is that throughout the period from mid-2014 to mid-2015, black voices were continually leading the conversation, outside of the vectors of traditional media.
Finally, the report points to Black Lives Matter being a more powerful social-media campaign because of its focus and its ability to make use of media like photographs and videos to spread its message. Movements like Occupy Wall Street and its vague “99 percent” were quickly obfuscated and coopted by other groups, but — as the researchers state — “Unlike wealth or income inequality, police brutality is concrete, discrete in its manifestations, and above all, visual.”
For all of the dismissive griping about social-media activism from its detractors, it can work incredibly well at directing debate and driving conversation. That’s the message of a new study from the Center for Media and Social Impact, which analyzed millions of tweets around Black Lives Matter and confirmed that social media was essential in turning local stories like Michael Brown’s death into a national discussion about race, criminal justice, and police brutality.
The study, by Deen Freelon, Charlton D. McIlwain, and Meredith D. Clark, is fascinating and well worth reading in full — not just for its confirmation of social media’s power, but for its analysis of its workings and limitations. To come to their conclusions, the authors analyzed 40.8 million tweets and more than 100,000 web links to determine what constitutes the greater Black Lives Matter initiative (which includes both Black Lives Matter as an organized protest movement, and the less codified discussion about racism, police brutality, and criminal justice happening under the umbrella of the hashtag #blacklivesmatter).
The researchers identified six major groups that engage in BLM discussion on Twitter, most of which are supportive of the movement’s goals in abolishing police violence against minorities: Black Lives Matter, amorphous hacktivist group Anonymous, black celebrities, black Twitter, mainstream news organizations, and conservatives. (See if you can guess which groups are not supportive.)
Analysis of the 40 million tweets, from 4.4 million unique users, reveals a few things about how online activism has operated for the last few years. For one thing, many of those participating in the dialogue do so by boosting the voices of others. From the report: “A large majority of the tweets in our dataset (75.3%) are retweets. In contrast, only a small minority of tweets (7.6%) contain @-mentions outside of a retweet context.” All six of the aforementioned communities contain de facto leaders referred to as “hubs.”
One can infer that though neither the BLM movement or its opposition have explicit leadership, there are those who wield a larger amount of power over the discourse. On the BLM side, it’s organizers like DeRay Mckesson, Johnetta Elzie, and Shaun King. In the conservative section, it’s commentators like Sean Hannity and outlets like Fox News and the Blaze.
If you spend all day on social media, it’s not difficult to find yourself in a filter bubble — one in which it seems as though the issues brought to bear by Black Lives Matter are continually being discussed. One particularly fascinating part of the report looks at activity over time across a much wider swath of Twitter — demonstrating that truly broad discussion correlates with major news events, and if you’re outside of a particular bubble you’re much less likely to be aware of the discussions happening inside.
Bilzerian was most recently seen on Instagram with a bag containing what he said was $100,000-worth of Powerball tickets.
Dan Bilzerian, the millionaire bro-king of Instagram, had his Twitter account hijacked Thursday by three kids who were able to break into his AOL email account and use it to reset his Twitter password. The hackers used Bilzerian’s 1.3 million–follower account to solicit follows for their own accounts, but never gained access to his social-media crown jewel, his Instagram account.
One of the hackers, who goes by 4iden, provided screenshots to the Daily Dot showing that he had access to the infamous playboy’s inbox and Twitter account. He claimed he got in through social engineering — tricking AOL customer service into giving him the keys to Bilzerian’s email.
When they were done with the account, the hackers didn’t return it directly to Bilzerian. Instead, the Daily Dot reports, they turned it over to minor Snapchat celebrity and well-known gamer Ricky Banks, telling him they were fans.
According to Banks, the hackers were good people who eventually decided to do the right thing. On Twitter, he described them as “a couple of kids,” and said he was trying to get in touch with Bilzerian to return the account.
As of Thursday evening, Bilzerian apparently hadn’t regained control of the account; the kids’ tweets, including a hilarious photo of a screaming goose, are still up on his account.
The Las Vegas taco joint Frijoles and Frescas is trying to find two men who broke into their store last week, while also using the incident as a form of viral marketing for their tacos.
In the video, two thieves smash the front door with a rock (it takes multiple attempts) and then run through the place, apparently searching for food before settling for the cash register.
“Please help us find these guys,” the video pleads. “So we can get them the tacos they rightfully deserve.”
As of today, the video has collected more than 1.17 million views in less than a week. “The idea was to provide something that the public could help us with to find the thieves, but at the same time, try to see the lighter side of what happened,” manager Greg Carlson told Eater.
When will online shaming stop? Where’s Jon Ronson when you need him?
What else is there? The original Forbes article proposes, “An ISIS agent could spell out an attack plan in Super Mario Maker’s coins and share it privately with a friend.” Except that every level uploaded from Mario Maker is public. Which means that ISIS would be making their communications publicly accessible to anyone who owns Super Mario Maker. Seems like a bad move.
Video-game terrorism sounds compelling if you’re trying to sell a good story to an audience scared of terrorism, distrustful of technology, and ambivalent about video games. But it doesn’t make much sense.
Over the weekend, an article posted by a Forbes contributor (the publication’s term for unvetted writers that publish on its site) pointed out that Belgian officials had complained that monitoring communication on the PlayStation 4 was “even more difficult to keep track of than [popular messaging app] WhatsApp.” The comment was actually delivered before last Friday’s attack — but it, and the Forbes article, set off an avalanche of erroneous speculation that the attackers had planned their operation on the gaming console, culminating in a remarkably stupid Today show segment Monday morning.
It’s certainly possible that ISIS terrorists are using their PS4s to communicate. Certainly, governments are vaguely concerned about it: It’s worth noting that in the past, spy agencies have monitored persistent online games like World of Warcraft and Second Life. But if you’ve played a video game online in the last half-decade or so, you’ll know that planning a terrorist attack through one seems like a really stupid idea. For one thing, as Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai reports at Motherboard, game consoles contain mechanisms for reporting abuse, so it’s likely that Sony or Microsoft could access user messages in certain cases. That makes it terrible for secret communications, as one Austrian teenager learned when he was arrested and charged with using his PS4 to download bomb-making plans.
But the PS4-as-terrorism-signal moral panic got much stupider than just the misguided suggestion that terrorists were using its built-in messaging system. Following a lead in the Forbes piece, BuzzFeed’s Sheera Frenkel noted, “Players, for instance, can use their weapons during a game to send a spray of bullets onto a wall, spelling out whole sentences to each other.” Which, well, yes, they can do that. But it would be both foolish and impractical.
For one thing, video games record a lot of stats. If you’re playing a popular console game online, the odds are pretty good that an enormous amount of data is getting sent back to the developer. Since 2007, Halo has allowed users to save replays of matches, down to every bullet fired, while Call of Duty used to track things like “Kill/death ratios, weapon stats, encounter distances, headshots, assists.” These things get logged in a database. An untraceable message sprayed into a wall with digital bullets is a romantic idea of techno-terror that plays well in headlines and on TV. But it would almost certainly be tracked in one way or another
But for the sake of argument, let’s say that terrorists did want to go through with this scheme. How would they go about doing it? Multiplayer shooters generally offer the option of a public or private match. If ISIS decided to communicate through a private match, it’d be creating a traceable record of multiple ISIS gaming accounts. If terrorists attempted to communicate secretly in public matches, they’d run the risk of having some bystander witness their (annoyingly difficult) terrorism planning.
Player 1: Okay, I’ll flank left. Player 2: Cool, cool. I’ll head right. Player 3: [Writes ISIS terrorism plan with bullets] Players 1 and 2: UUUUuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhH????
That’s not even touching on the fact that it wouldn’t fly on a technical level: Bullet holes in video games are flat textures applied to an already existing 3-D model; it’s almost never worth the memory allocation to keep bullet holes around for very long. That’s why in video games, bullet holes, scorch marks from explosives, and dead bodies tend to magically disappear. It keeps the game from getting mired and running poorly. The point is: Bullet-hole messages wouldn’t last very long. Certainly not long enough to write out full sentences.
And there’s this one, posted in 2013:
The phenomenon isn’t just limited to dads, either. Here’s a 10-month-old baffled by his mom’s sister:
Hopefully baby Reed doesn’t figure this whole "twins" thing out before he inevitably gets invited to re-create the trick on Ellen.
Recognizing a parent’s face is one of the most important early skills babies learn. So when one of the parents has an identical twin, it’s a recipe for confusion. Which one is Dada? You? This guy? Both of you?! Fortunately, confused babies are extremely adorable, so it’s also a recipe for a very popular Facebook video.
This is baby Reed, and the guy on the left is his dad, Stephen Ratpojanakul. On the right is Stephen’s twin brother, Michael, who wears glasses. Apparently, that’s the only way 16-month-old Reed can tell his dad and uncle apart. So when Dad puts on the glasses, Reed goes straight for Uncle Michael.
Although he’s obviously befuddled by the twin-dad situation, Reed appears to be an extremely chill baby.
“I promise Reed was having fun — he’s the happiest baby I’ve ever seen,” Stephen Ratpojanakul told BuzzFeed.
In a fascinating twist, baby Reed’s mom, Carroll, also has a twin. She told BuzzFeed that she and her sister tried the same trick, but Reed somehow wasn’t fooled. Maybe it’s all in the glasses?
This isn’t the first video in the “baby confused by twin parents” genre, by any means. This one, of a slightly older baby named Charlie meeting his dad’s twin brother at the front door, has picked up nearly 5 million views on YouTube since 2014:
A Norwegian newspaper apologized to readers after mistakenly running an obituary announcing the death of globally beloved humanitarian Santa Claus at age 227. According to Aftenposten, the country’s second-largest paper, Dear Father Christmas died December 3 at Nordkapp, Norway’s northernmost point — some 1,300 miles from his home at the North Pole. Tragic news if true.
But Aftenposten quickly assured distraught readers that it was not true, and that the death announcement had been posted in error.
“A mistake in Aftenposten internal procedures led to a fictional obituary of Santa Claus being published in our digital systems,” the paper stated, saying the classified ad violated its guidelines for obituary content.
With a major Norwegian newspaper formally confirming Santa Claus’s death was a hoax, there’s only one logical conclusion to draw here: Santa Claus is alive and well. If the news implied it, it must be real.
And thank goodness for that, because no one wanted to read the inevitable hot takes on how Santa was an overrated fake altruist whose legacy will be tainted by commercialism and labor violations.
But just as important, people are in there treating it like reality TV:
It’s the latter group that I subscribe to. Here, we have a young female lead in the prime of her sexuality,
beholden to her hideous child and her temperature-sensitive egg,
and a doofy male counterpart who’s largely absent from their immaculate nest-home except for when he’s stirring shit up.
About 98 percent of the feed is just the First Lady sitting in the center of the nest, eyes alert, head turning at every sound she hears.
Let’s face facts: Most animal livestreams are trash. There’s nothing especially compelling about depressed pandas sleeping in the corner of an enclosure, or goats quietly munching on pellets. But somehow, despite the genre’s limitations, the American Eagle Foundation’s bald-eagle nest cam has been really doing it for me this week.
On the rare occasions Mr. President does show up, he stands at the lip of the nest and does nothing. A couple minutes later, he flies away.
“I’m going to 7-Eleven to get cartridges for my e-cig,” I bet he’s saying. “I’ll be right back.”
This morning, he dumped a ton of live catfish into the nest and then ate them all.
The chunk he left for the First Lady hasn’t been touched, and it’s attracting flies. Thanks, babe.
The feed tracks the nest of two American bald eagles, Mr. President and the First Lady, who live at the top of a tree in the U.S. National Arboretum in Washington, D.C., and it’s riveting for two big reasons:
1. There are eggs that can hatch at any moment, and … 2. Mr. President is an unabashed shithead.
That first point is pretty self-explanatory. One egg hatched Wednesday night and yielded a very spooky little bb who can’t stand or open its eyes yet, but the second egg is still yet to start. On its website, the American Eagle Foundation asks everyone to tweet hatch-date and time predictions using #dceaglecam, but the hashtag is just an all-purpose live chat for feed-hounds in a really beautiful way.
The most common culprits are teachers using the stream as a learning tool:
Or people keeping it on while they’re at work:
This particular clip of Mariah Cary comes from the music video for secretly her best song, a poppy, kinda techno rendition of “Auld Lang Syne.” You can see the clip around the 2:45 mark.
“Oh, hi, I hope everyone is having a good time at this Thanksgiving. I’m here too. I just got here. This spread looks great. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.”
This year, and every year, I am thankful for: this GIF!
Look at this GIF.
It’s so good. I love this GIF so much. Every time I hear the words Thanksgiving or Mariah Carey or GIF, I think about this one digital file.
Please save this GIF on your phone and share it with your family and friends as you gather around the table with the turkey on it. “This year, I am thankful for … this GIF!!!”
Interrupt the football game by throwing this GIF up on the big screen. “Guys, I know there’s football going on. I know about TDs. But I’m here to talk about TGs (Top GIFs).”
Here’s the food featured in this GIF: turkey (Great!) carrots (good for the eyes) bread (oh, heck, yeah) cranberry sauce (not for me, but if that’s your thing I’m not gonna hold it against you. I’m in the minority.) mashed potatoes (Yup!) pie (I like pie a lot now; didn’t used to) an ice-cream sundae? (sure)
Not a bad food in the bunch. The case could be made for all of those foods.
VR’s some powerful stuff. You can use it to tour a college campus — to practice landing a small plane on your private island — to, uh, read Reddit? — but it can also help you prepare for everyday situations.
Like, let’s say you’re at a house party and a cat walks into the room. Which asshole are you going to be: the asshole who ignores the cat? The asshole who tries to pet the cat and scares it away? With Andy Pandy’s (thus far unavailable to the public) VR cat-petting simulator, you can try all of your cat-petting strats in a low-stakes, vegan environment.
Just like in real life, you can’t wait to hang out with that indifferent, sweetie-faced animal. And, just like in real life, your nervous robot hands will probably ruin the whole thing.

It seems like the big scam is to show you ads, and to have you share content so that more people will see those ads. It’s the same big scam you may remember from how basically every website makes money.
Should you post Be Like Bill? No. It is bad and asinine, and even one item of fake personal data is too high a price to pay for it. Is Be Like Bill a virus? Unless you mean “virus” in the sense that it is contagious, harmful, and spreading rapidly through the human population, probably not.
These news stations did more harm by milking a current viral craze for Facebook traffic and extending Be Like Bill’s moment in the sun than they would have by ignoring it and letting it die on its own.
And if you’re scrupulous about making sure companies don’t collect and monetize your personal information, what are you doing on Facebook anyway?
“Be Like Bill,” the moralizing stick-figure template onto which anyone can cast their particular social mores and behavioral pet peeves, was the first real meme of the year. And, when the year ends, it will probably be remembered as the worst. But the only thing more annoying than Bill is the backlash against him. Today, seemingly every local news station in the U.S. is Facebooking the same story on how “Be Like Bill” could be stealing your personal information.
True: The business model of some viral meme generators is probably to collect your personal information from Facebook and sell it, or to covertly gain access your Facebook account so they can use it to post spam. Also true: You should be careful about using sketchy web apps you’ve never heard of, and consider reading the fine print. Fine advice, local news. Thank you.
But when it comes to the Be Like Bill generator, on a site called Blobla.com — which our newsreader intentionally struggles to pronounce, emphasizing how absurd the site’s name is — the boilerplate local news stories don’t provide hard evidence that there’s any data mining going on. They point to some sketchy terms of service Blobla used to have, then tells us they’re no longer in effect. The terms now promise the site does not collect your Facebook data when you share. Hmm.
As far as the information you’re providing to make your own Be Like Bill picture, it’s just a name (which can be made up) and a gender (likewise), plus a standard Facebook share button that puts the finished result on your timeline. The popular browser extension Ghostery, which blocks adware and trackers running invisibly on websites, only found a couple on the Be Like Bill page: They’re for Google ads and Facebook Connect.
There have been gestures in this direction: The first version of Gchat blended real-time discussion with asynchronous messages, effectively if not seamlessly, before devolving into whatever Google Hangouts is supposed to be. For several years, Facebook quietly assigned an email address to each user, allowing their messages to piggyback on existing contacts outside the network, until that feature was eventually killed because of lack of adoption. So if the big guys can’t pull it off, what hope do the rest of us have?
For one thing, simply being the rest of us in the first place helps, because when compatibility is the most important core feature, strength in numbers is paramount — even Facebook’s tremendous user base is still dwarfed by the number of people who don’t use Facebook. We will create something new eventually, of course, as we always somehow do, and I almost hope we don’t even notice because we’re all too busy talking to each other with it. How much longer we have to wait for that moment just depends on how willing we are to let millionaires keep bickering over who will get to own it. Anyone who even starts to answer that question is already wrong, though, because at this point email simply can’t be killed by a purely partisan effort. There will probably never be a clear winner, aside from either everybody or nobody.
The most compelling tribute to the late Ray Tomlinson might simply be that, by the time he passed away on March 5, it would have been impossible to call for a moment of silence using the medium he pioneered. Tomlinson was best known as the inventor of email, first prototyped in 1971; 45 years later, it’s still the most important instrument shared across industry, our personal lives, government. The contents of certain emails and the precise nature of their exchange may even still have a role in determining who ends up becoming the next president of the United States.
Email is at once both hugely important and intensely personal. Few life changes are as lasting and far-reaching as switching addresses. It’s central in most contemporary stories about identity theft, because a compromised account becomes a way to gather up all sorts of other information, including further authentications — literally, we let email define what it means to be ourselves online. Simultaneously, huge faceless spam industries exist solely to churn enormous amounts of nonsensical messages through the internet in the hopes that someone might see an ad or even get suckered into sending money to an imperiled foreign prince. A second complementary industry then attempts to negate the first and ensure that you never have to see the ad. It’s all so absurd, and so deeply consequential.
Now that our toasters are about to start talking to us, we are clearly well past the point where the original shape of email should be considered sufficient. The messages we send to other people are probably the closest thing to pure thought expressed on the internet with any regularity, but we have yet to design a system detailed enough to capture them. Already, it’s only through proprietary vendors that even relatively basic new features like message-read receipts and threaded discussions have become possible. Just think what could be accomplished with an expansion of the core specifications and technologies behind email: multiple weighted subject lines, hierarchical discussion flows, categories and tags, notifications, multimedia, downstream actions, linked message fragments, engagement modes for users beyond simply “Cc” and “Bcc,” permalinks and annotations.
I could keep rambling on forever with cranky feature suggestions, but none of this will actually happen in the foreseeable future, because nobody is even trying to build a better system. Those supposed email killers you keep hearing about will all fail to actually supplant it, because while they may share the mechanisms of email — or even improve on them — they largely omit its intent. Anybody out to replace the dominant communication method in the developed world can and should be swiftly discounted based on ideology alone, before the tool is even considered.
That is, it will remain impossible to build a better communication system until the primary goal is actually communication itself. But by and large, we don’t invest much in creating new open standards, specifications, and protocols around which entirely new classes of tools can be built — we’re too busy trying to sell apps! And at the end of the day, Slack is just another app.
The funding structure of the technology world is largely set up to fight interoperability. That’s fine to a point, but can you imagine where we’d be if Snapchat, WhatsApp, and Slack started cooperating? We might get something amazing, even an entire new paradigm for organizing ideas, but everybody involved would have to abandon their walled gardens, and with them the untold billions in hypothetical dollars! Maybe this is one of the intangible things we lose as the elders of computing depart us: priorities from an age where computers truly were a new frontier, still too wild to become overly lucrative and awkward. I’ve never done it myself, but I must imagine that the thrill of discovering a new ocean has nothing to do with patenting the nearest boat?
Meanwhile, the rest of us are just trapped in the standoff, babbling endlessly. Without lots of sharing and coordination, there’s a growing possibility that email, or something very close to it, will stick around for a long time, even in the face of other options, as our first truly long-lasting vestigial electronic form. The longer we continue with email as the lingua franca of digital communication, the more entrenched it becomes, and the likelihood of any distinct party or company killing it off becomes increasingly more remote, especially as the incentives of the industry discourage cooperation. You can do almost anything using Slack’s powerful APIs, except host them yourself. Someone important will always consider that their breaking point, and justifiably so.
A coordinated growth effort may seem like a pipe dream, but it was only very recently that Wikipedia managed to reboot our understanding of digital reference materials, despite being propelled by an almost cartoonish idealism. Absent a cataclysmic ground-up reinvention of messaging protocols, the most sensible realistic path forward for new communication tools probably consists at first of minor features built atop regular emails, almost like a sort of intelligent formatting based on new information embedded in hidden file attachments built to a precise and powerful specification. But even that could only ever be a hack for a better individual message, and not really a more powerful aggregate system within which to transmit and then absorb them.
This weekend, an Australian by the name of Chris Harrigan shared an anecdote straight out of Finding Nemo that involved a man, a train, a flock of seagulls, and a plate of fish and chips.
What happened after the train doors closed is unclear (as is, we should note, the veracity of the story itself). Presumably, given their captive audience, the seagulls yelled, “Attention, ladies and gentlemen … It’s showtime!” and then performed an unimpressive break-dance routine while all of the passengers avoided eye contact.
As the government and the tech industry jockey to strike a balance between privacy and security, WhatsApp is trying to set a new standard. Wired reports that the messaging service, owned by Facebook and used by more than a billion people worldwide, has turned on end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on every form of communication — not just on your texts but your photos and videos as well.
This means that only the sender and the recipient would be able to read messages, and it’d be impossibly hard (probably just impossible) for others: Not even WhatsApp itself can decrypt the messages, so no government could force the company to do so.
End-to-end encryption, as the name implies, takes place only at either end of a given message: the message is encrypted locally on the phone or computer of the sender, and then sent, unreadable, across the internet, to the recipient’s phone or computer, where it is decrypted. There are a few implementations, but one popular method works like this: Every user has two keys, a public key and a private key; the public key, obviously, is available to everyone, but the private key is only accessible to that specific user. Messages sent to a specific user are encrypted with that user’s public key, and decrypted upon receipt with their private key, to which only they have access. This is how messaging systems like WhatsApp and iMessage work: The encryption keys aren’t even available to the companies providing the service. E2EE keeps data protected throughout the entire transaction, but it often requires a complex system of key management to implement.
It can be easily assumed that law enforcement is not thrilled at this move. WhatsApp has created a situation in which, even if compelled by court order, it cannot access user data. WhatsApp is already tied up in at least one court case concerning a wiretap order that, given the service’s setup, is impossible to implement.
Want to get started? To enable the feature, users don’t have to do anything other than make sure that they’re running the latest software version.
Snapchat rarely makes acquisitions, but it made a big one today, purchasing Bitmoji for more than $100 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. Exactly what the popular photo-messaging app needs Bitmoji for remains unspecified, but the popularity of Bitmoji cannot be denied. Since the app — which lets users create cartoon avatars and insert them into prefab images — debuted in 2014, it’s stayed in the top 100 on the iOS app store.
The purchase, while definitely out of the blue, isn’t entirely inexplicable. Incorporating Bitmoji into Snapchat could get more people to use the service for messaging outside of photos and videos (Snapchat does have a text-chat feature that often goes un-emphasized in discussion of the service). Think along the lines of more complex emoji.
In January, Jacob Blackstock, Bitmoji’s CEO, explained Bitmoji’s appeal as a communication tool to Amanda Hess, for Slate:
But Bitmoji itself is not a messaging app. It simply creates content for use on other platforms. Repurposing it as a first-party tool — especially one as popular as Snapchat’s — would likely increase the cartoon-y avatars’ use, not place them further out of reach. And Bitmoji is already striking deals for sponsored image-sets in the same way that Snapchat sells sponsored filters. Great content that inserts you into your favorite cultural properties. Like Borat!
Bitmoji could also be worked into the app’s popular Lens, virtual face masks that automatically follow your movements and expressions. Imagine, if you will, a nightmare world in which your cartoon Bitmoji avatar is mapped onto your real face, bringing to life an unholy hybrid of man and machine. Just a thought. :)
The acquisition, overall, feels like an attempt for Snapchat to get back to one-on-one messaging, having already built out its extremely popular public Stories tool and invited a certain subset of publishers to place their content on the app natively. It’s building out the final point in its trifecta of public, semi-public, and private. Soon, you won’t even have to spell out emotions, you’ll just be a couple button taps or hotkeys away.

This seems like a song that the seniors on my soccer team would listen to at the back of the bus on the way to a game. I would listen to this to set the pace during a brisk jog.
The performance quickly went viral — “children performing jingoistic anthems” is a potent subgenre. And whenever a song goes viral, there’s a decent chance someone will remix it. So I headed over to SoundCloud to see what was up.

“Turn Up for Trump” by Groves
There are many finish lines in life. There’s the track-meet kind — the kind Makenna Kroge only barely made it to last year — and then there are other kinds. Maybe better kinds.
“This sounds kind of dumb,” Kroge’s friend Lexi Cornelius told me when we talked on the phone early today, “but now I really want to go on Ellen.” Now, that’s a finish line. That’s what Daniel Lara and Josh Holz got after "Damn, Daniel" infected the internet a few weeks ago. And now that Lexi’s tweet — a video of Makenna eating shit, twice, during an 8th grade track meet last year — has over 13,000 retweets, it could be in Lexi and Makenna’s future.
Kroge (“almost 15”) and Cornelius (“almost 16”) were together when I reached them by phone this afternoon, but they didn’t even know each other last year, when Kroge’s mom caught her daughter in this bottom-of-your-soul relatable video:
Kroge explained: “I don’t really know, I was super nervous. A bunch of girls that didn’t like me were there so I was going to impress them.” She and Cornelius dissolved into giggles. “After I fell, at the end, when I am looking back,” Kroge continued, “you can hear my dad and he’s screaming at me to run.” Kroge finished the race, but came in last.
Kroge and Cornelius recently met and became friends, and, taking part in the classic ritual of admitting your humiliations to your good friends, Kroge showed Cornelius (who goes to another high school in the same town of Green Bay, Wisc.) the video. And Cornelius, taking part in the classic ritual of publicizing your friends’ humiliations, immediately asked Kroge if she could tweet it.
“I honestly thought it would get one retweet and ten favorites,” Cornelius admitted. She sent the tweet out Saturday afternoon, and says she thought it started gaining traction after a “football player retweeted it.” (She couldn’t remember which one.) ESPN soon followed suit. The girls hope Ellen DeGeneres isn’t trailing too far behind. They both said they had to shut down their Twitter notifications overnight: “It was getting too crazy,” Kroge said. “I had a lot of notifications coming in,” Cornelius added.
Kroge said she’s not embarrassed by her face-plant since the video was taken so long ago — and, you know, virality can mend many wounds. At one point I wished them luck and told them I thought the video was even funnier than “Damn, Daniel.” Cornelius gasped. “Can you say that again, what you just said? We want to record it.” And so I did, and the girls once again dissolved into high-pitched giggles.
On social media, citizens are hotly debating an important and controversial photograph in which a man, or a woman, appears to be pantsless at some sort of reception desk. The context is unclear.
The Facebook page Passenger Shaming posted the image yesterday but did not offer up any further details. The New York Post says the image is “[dividing] the Internet,” but anecdotally, I have only seen this image on the website of the New York Post.
My personal thoughts? I don’t think this person is wearing pants. I mean, possibly they are wearing beige pants, but that is a very fleshy hue. To my untrained eye at least.
Let’s zoom in.
Honestly, that looks like a butt to me. There are probably people out there more qualified than I who can weigh in on whether this butt is clothed or unclothed, and to those people I say: Let us know in the comments.
How much of this do you understand? It’s almost impenetrable unless you spend a lot of tin in the Dashboard. I could explain to you what “meme trash” and “aesthetic” mean in these contexts (“obsessed with memes” and “obsessed with an imagined early-’90s computer aesthetic,” respectively), but that’s almost beside the point. These images are oddly compelling because they’re self-deprecating collections of Tumblr stereotypes and running jokes that work in aggregate; the sheer magnitude is the thrust.
Isolated into segments, each of these options doesn’t make a ton of sense, but the image works on a holistic level, throwing so many niche references and so much nonsense out at once that it manages to convey the broad weirdness of a subculture. Users can tag themselves as one of the options, but that’s not really the point in my interpretation. When it comes to ironic self-loathing online, no service can hold a candle to Tumblr, which has cornered the market on oddball teens commiserating with like-minded individuals. The point is to convey, “Look how insane we all are.”
In many ways, it’s the kitchen-sink approach to memes, which usually prioritize relatability and the clear conveyance of a single emotion. What these “tag yourself” images do is throw as many references and emotions as they can at a viewer and then let them see what they want to see.
If you’re at all familiar with Facebook or Instagram, you’re familiar with the “tag yourself” meme: a grid of cartoons or photos from which you cast roles for yourself and your friends. And if you’re at all familiar with Tumblr, you’re familiar with its total straight-faced incomprehensibility to outsiders. The rabbits above — from “edge,” who “only listens to ludo,” to “wingo,” the “ghost” who is “sweet 2 children” — are what happens when the two collide.
In a way, it’s almost surprising that it took the “tag yourself” meme this long to turn meta. When Facebook introduced photo tagging, it almost immediately set off a wave of memes in which you allied each of your friends with bland friend traits and pop-culture characters. Which social archetype are you? Which Pokémon are you? And so on and so forth. Those types of images have mostly fallen by the wayside of Facebook, but very suddenly and very quickly, they are back on Tumblr.
Yet here we are, in 2016, and the “tag yourself” meme has gone bonkers on Tumblr. This is an unexpected development mainly because Tumblr doesn’t support photo tagging. “Tag yourself” in this instance isn’t actually about defining your online identity. Rather, it’s a referendum on Tumblr culture itself — the way users speak and interact, and the way memes on the service progress almost instantly to their post-ironic phase.
Take these examples:
Animal Planet’s Puppy Bowl — a tradition nearly as old as America itself (do not fact-check this) — has become riveting television. Just imagine: What if football … were played by dogs? And if there were not really any rules for Dog Football? This year’s Puppy Bowl XII will feature 84 puppies. That might seem like a lot of puppies, but one (me) could argue that it’s not enough.
But even with so many puppies, time and technological innovation march ceaselessly onward, and so, this year, the Puppy Bowl is embracing new viewing experiences — chief among them the ability to watch the Puppy Bowl in 360-degree video and virtual reality, putting you right in the middle of the action. You can see a preview here.
It’ll be broadcast on YouTube, so if you have Google Cardboard you, too, can put yourself in the middle of the game. Of puppies.
Sexting is difficult. I mean, I wouldn’t know, but that’s what I hear. It’s difficult to put yourself out there without a guarantee of receiving something in return. Men sometimes feel entitled to nude photographs (thanks, patriarchy) and are unsure of what to do when rebuffed. The bargaining process is tense, with a lot of back and forth, but both parties have, on occasion, been able to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.
Case in point: this Imgur collection of dudes willing to do anything for nudes. (Standard Imugr-screenshots-of-texts disclosure: There is a decent chance these are fake, though God kows why.) Here are the things men are willing to smear on their bodies in exchange for some sexts: mustard, a fried egg, human excrement. Click through the gallery below to see.
As Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War, “All men can see these tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.”
It’s hard to imagine any other nation celebrating their national humiliation quite so explicitly — or so humorously. (Numbers jokes work well elsewhere, too: When the currency plummeted to 4.20 Brazilian reais to the dollar from a high of 1.5, the obvious response was to declare they’d be smoking their currency.)
The online practice of zueira, when applied to tragedy or failure, is a source of pride for many here, and of consternation for others. Active participants in Brazil’s online life say the phenomenon has deeper roots than just the few tough years Brazil has had recently, or even the internet itself; they cite an especially gregarious, loud, and social culture; a view of history as a series of missed opportunities; deep mistrust of elites’ capacity to deliver on promises; and even the legacy of Brazil’s military dictatorship.
“Obviously irony is something almost innate to Brazilians. You only have to look at the history of our Carnaval marches. So many of the lyrics relied on sexual double entendres. [Irony] is also our way of dealing with things, of minimizing problems,” says Francisco Junior (Twitter: @fjunior), an editor at a radio station in the capital of Brasília.
And unlike Americans, Brazilians don’t see history as a series of awesome victories. “We like to display our failures. We like to celebrate what could have been instead of what we’ve actually done. Look, we’ve won five World Cups, and the 2014 tournament went pretty well overall. But we’re fixated on 7x1.”
A lot of this has to do with the so-called complexo de vira-lata, a putative national inferiority complex inspired by another World Cup loss, in 1950. It, or the fear of it, hangs everywhere, and Brazilians are just as likely to complain bitterly about their country as they are to angrily denounce others for having the “mongrel complex” themselves. “During the dictatorship and its attendant censorship, jokes, humor, and irony were the forms of protest,” reminds Junior. “And now everyone is just jumping on the internet whenever anything happens.”
Regardless of its origins, this manic, self-deprecatory joking seems to be everywhere online here — probably because Brazilians are just so damn active on social networks. Essentially everyone here is connected, and the fifth-most-populous country in the world seems to spend much more time on social networks than people do in the U.S., says Manuela Barem, editor at BuzzFeed Brazil.
“There’s a big difference between the culture of the English-language internet and ours. Brazilians are much more obsessed with what happens online, to the point of spending hours on the same topic. Perhaps that has to do with their desire to always [be] talking about the same thing, for everyone to ‘be a part’ of what’s going on … it ends up being that they’re just posting way more than an American or English person,” says Barem.
When it comes to the special space for trauma, she says her “impression is that it’s a type of minor catharsis, that comes in the form of irony when we confront a problem or some bad news, and we want to react but there’s no apparent solution.”
Last Friday, the day that Brazil’s exhaustingly extravagant Carnaval celebrations officially started, scientists here announced that the feared Zika virus had been detected in urine and saliva. They couldn’t be sure if this meant it could be spread through kissing, but the risk was high enough to warrant a recommendation that pregnant women be cautious and to merit further study.
Of course, Brazil is now a democracy, and people can say whatever they want. The jokers make it clear, too, that not everything goes. So actual death and trauma (say, a birth defect due to Zika) is not joke fodder, whereas a generalized health crisis and constant, low-level terror, perhaps due to public failure, can be funny indeed.
“You can make fun of [the mosquito genus] Aedes but not microcephaly. I can joke about the Zika epidemic, but the government can’t. They have to treat the problem seriously. We have an inefficient state, the economy is in a bad state, and we lost 7x1. We laugh at ourselves before the world can laugh at us,” says Vera Vanessa, the very active and much-beloved Twitter user @verineas. “If the government doesn’t provide the necessary support … what else is there for us to do?”
Since Carnaval often involves a lot of kissing — especially of strangers — this was terrible news. But on social networks, suddenly flooded with jokes and memes, the bad mood was undercut by the gleefully dark humor characteristic of the Brazilian web. Users posted pictures of people with condoms over their mouths or entire heads. A teacher posted the title of a fake online photo gallery she had conceived: “See all the celebrities that caught Zika this Carnaval”! A well-liked journalist reminded others that during the festivities streets are worryingly more likely to run with piss than overflow with spontaneous smooches (this is true).
Bad news can be, oddly, good news for the Brazilian internet and its armies of online comedians. There’s something special about internet culture here, more so than the fact that Brazil has one of the world’s most connected and prolific online populations: Brazil’s internet culture is very, maybe particularly, fond of turning national trauma into a source of endless humor and ironic celebration.
There are a couple of local phrases for this phenomenon. Rir para não chorar ("laugh so you don’t cry"), and the supposedly untranslatable A zueira não tem limite, which is something close to “the (aggressive) joking never ends.” And recently Brazil has had a lot to cry about — or avoid crying about.
One of the most famous tragedies to have occurred in the last few years has now become a meme. Actually, it’s become more than a meme — it’s become a part of Brazilian Portuguese and spawned a couple of online holidays. I’m talking, of course, about “7x1,” the score of the Brazilian national team’s catastrophic loss to Germany in the 2014 World Cup.
In the almost two years since, a number of blows to the national psyche — a punishing recession, a shocking corruption scandal, the Zika outbreak — have often incited the response “7x1 was nothing [compared to this].” On both the anniversary of the loss and January 7 (7/1 in the Brazilian transcription), Brazilians superimpose the German flag over their online photos in a twisted reappropriation of the Facebook rainbow or French flag performance.
It’s hardly surprising that Jay Z was at the Super Bowl on Sunday to watch his wife, Beyoncé, slay the halftime show as expected. Slightly more surprising: Usher Raymond was there, and he ended up hanging out with hip-hop’s royal couple at least long enough for them to pose for his Snapchat. And then this happened:
Now Jay Z apparently being unaware of Snapchat is a meme, spreading all over Twitter and on several pop-culture sites — in spite of the fact that Jay Z obviously knows what Snapchat is. For one thing, whatever Usher is saying in this video, it’s not even close to “it’s a video on Snapchat.” Because the second line of the Twitter joke is correct, it seems like no one bothered to listen to the first one.
For another, Jay made an appearance on DJ Khaled’s Snapchat — probably the best Snapchat account there is — less than a month ago, and he was clearly aware that Khaled was making a video.
True, Jay Z doesn’t have his own Snapchat, but he also doesn’t need one. That’s for younger rappers. Hov is a business, man. And what kind of business doesn’t know what Snapchat is?
A woman who goes by miss-izzle on Reddit says her husband has a glass or two of wine on nights when he doesn’t have to work the next morning, but he can never get through both glasses before falling asleep in his chair or on the couch. Same.
The primary difference between me and this gentleman is that my wife doesn’t take a picture of me every time I pass out next to a half-full glass of wine, then turn all of those individual photos into a collage and put it on Reddit. (For the record, she says she’s been collecting the pictures for a year, and got his permission before dumping them online.)
Also, and I’m not trying to brag here, I own more than three shirts.
Another point of contrast: I don’t only drink wine and fall asleep on nights preceding a day off. For that matter, I don’t only drink wine and fall asleep on nights. And I don’t like Pinot Grigio that much. And, come to think of it, nor do I have three children and work 50 hours a week while also pursuing a degree in mathematics education.
But other than those few small differences, it me. Wine makes me sleepy.
The iPad Pro, the Apple tablet that could theoretically function as a laptop replacement, is now available in a much more convenient and easy-to-hold size. You will still look like a freaking dork taking pictures with it, though.
Size: 9.7-inch screen, and very thin — you could use it with one hand. (The screen is also 25 percent brighter.)How big is that? We’re talking two small burgers or one very large one.Accessories: It functions with Apple’s stylus, the Apple Pencil (which costs $100, LOL), and a new Apple Keyboard.What makes it “Pro”? Well, the Pencil, but also: It’s much faster than the iPad Air or Mini — closer in speed to a slow laptop.Price: Starts at $599 for 32 GB.
Apple Watch … bands
No new Apple Watch, but a reduced price, and lots of new accessories. This doesn’t feel like a desperate attempt to sell a flagging product at all!
Accessories: A slew of new watchbands, some of them — pause for dramatic effect — woven nylon.How big is that? You know, watchband sized — maybe one or two Totino’s Pizza Rolls.Price: Dropping, and now starts at $299.
iOS 9.3
Apple’s phone and tablet operating system is getting a new update.
If you’ve opened up Twitter or Facebook today, you might’ve heard that Apple announced a series of new products — in particular, the SE, a phone that’s as fast as the latest 6s but in the much sleeker and more pocket-friendly body of the older 5s. Here’s what you need to know.
How big is that? 310 MB. (Software is a collection of digital bits and bytes. You cannot place food on it.) When can I upgrade? Today! Check your phone’s settings, then click through to “General,” and then to “Software Update.” New feature: Night Shift moves your screen to warmer colors at night and in low light, so when you stay up late to argue with someone on Twitter you will strain your eyes less. (The feature is a direct ripoff of a popular app called f.lux.) Notes: The Notes app can now be password-protected, the better to play out your Apple-vs-FBI fantasies in the comfort of your own home.
Kicking things off at the event, Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke briefly about the company’s commitment to fighting the FBI: “We owe it to our customers and we owe it to our country.” He then quickly pivoted to the environment, where the company announced it was making strides in transitioning to 100-percent renewable energy. Apple also showed off Liam, the cute name for its terrifying and complex robot that rips obsolete iPhones apart in order to recycle their metallic corpses.
And then they got to the good stuff:
iPhone SE
This was the big one: The small iPhone is back. After two generations of iPhone (the 6 and the 6S) at a hefty 5.5 inches, the smaller form factor of the previous models — the 5 and 5S — is back. If you have small hands and spend a lot of time on the phone, this is the one you want.
Size: Four-inch screen — basically, the size and shape of the previous (smaller) iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s.How big is that? You could fit, hmm, two finger sandwiches on it?But is it slower? The SE features an internal chipset similar to the 6s, so it’ll be functionally identical in most ways, with one exception: The phone will lack 3D Touch, a feature that takes into account the amount of pressure being exerted on the screen.I don’t ever use 3D Touch: Right, so unless you love the large size of the 6s, the iPhone SE is the one for you.What does SE stand for? “Special edition,” apparently.Price: Starts at $399 for the 16GB model.When: Preorders begin on Thursday, March 24.
A Smaller iPad Pro
On Friday night, the French national soccer team was about 15 minutes into a friendly match against Germany in the Stade de France when a suicide attacker detonated his vest. The bomber reportedly had a ticket to the game and triggered his explosives after a security guard discovered them while frisking him. Three minutes later, a second attacker also blew himself up outside the stadium; by the end of the night, 129 people had been killed in a series of coordinated terror attacks across Paris. The most widely distributed documentation of the first of those attacks was a six-second clip posted by Terje Haavin, a 22-year-old soccer fan from Tromsø, Norway. Within a day Haavin’s video had become the most-viewed ever on the site. At 138 million loops, it surpassed Duck Army, the previous ruler of the all-time list, which took several weeks to get there. The clip became a centerpiece in the early coverage of the Paris attacks for major news organizations around the world. At one point on Friday evening, the video’s view count was going up by at least 100,000 loops every refresh.
Vine was founded in June of 2012 and snapped up by Twitter less than six months later as a simple way for users to integrate video into their postings. Its six-second time limit may seem constraining, but users have found ways to make the platform a showcase for everything from stop-motion animation to bite-size comedy routines. Lightweight, easy to use, and quick to load, Vine found much of its success with teenagers and young adults, who made use of its low-threshold, tossed-off qualities in endless short, meme-based skits and pranks.
Vine is also great for sports highlights, which is what Haavin primarily uses his Vine account for. “I was watching the game to keep an eye on the Arsenal players playing for France,” Haavin told New York in an instant message exchange. “I always record matches to post goals and highlights on Twitter in case something interesting comes up.” After he heard the first reports of the events outside the stadium, he isolated the moment when TV viewers could hear the explosion and quickly threw it up on Vine and Twitter without a second thought. Typically, he adds a watermark with his Twitter handle to any videos he posts — but, in this case, doing so seemed wrong. “The Vine from the Stade de France is the only video I haven’t given myself credit on,” he said. “I felt it would be inappropriate to direct attention towards me given the terrible events that happened in Paris.”
Haavin even confessed to being a bit uncomfortable with the record his video had set. “I’m a bit sad to overtake Duck Army — I think it’s a funny and very original idea,” he said. “I feel like my video is in a very different category.”
There’s no question that is true. Vine may be best known for a video of a bin of rubber ducks honking, but the same things that make it so appealing to teenage pranksters and meme distributors make it perfect for breaking news. With a Vine, there is no such thing as telling readers to skip to a certain time stamp in order to get to the important part. It’s a perfect way to put observers in a snippet of the action. Videos on Vine are lightweight, with the average falling somewhere between 600kb and 1mb. This means they load quickly when embedded in pages and play easily even in situations where there is low bandwidth or a bad connection. And, unlike YouTube or some media organizations’ proprietary players, there’s no pre-roll advertising on Vine — you get served exactly what you want, quickly. (Vine also has a reputation for being more relaxed about copyright: Haavin says he chose Vine over YouTube in part because YouTube has “a much more strict copyright takedown policy.”)
Like many others, Haavin sees Vine playing a key role in how people experience major events — even world-changing ones. “Vine can be used for so much,” he said. “I’m glad news has a place in it, too.”
The irony is that Jordan is obsessively protective about his image and the way he’s perceived by a generation of fans that didn’t grow up watching him dominate the competition. Every now and then, he pops up to claim that LeBron James isn’t really all that, a means of elevating himself as it becomes increasingly clear that LeBron is the best post-Jordan player. During his playing career, Jordan was never selectable in basketball video games, but a few years ago he loaned his likeness to the NBA 2K series, which included a mode in which one could play through his greatest moments. He wants badly for today’s 15-year-old to know he was the GOAT, but after all of those public statements and polygonal nostalgia tours what’s finally given him his desperately sought ubiquity is a mocking, embarrassing meme — a yawning gap between intent and outcome that inadvertently argues for the irrelevance of branding consultants.
This is an era where the internet has enabled endless recontextualization. It doesn’t matter where a joke originated or what its original context or the facts of production were — only that I’m laughing at it this moment. It’s simply unrealistic for anyone to maintain a one-way flow of information — to have total control over how his image or identity is used. Even Beyoncé, perhaps the celebrity most sensitive about her image (to the point where she’s filmed her day-to-day life for the last several years), is susceptible to a camera snapping at just the wrong moment. I’m sure Michael Jordan is aware of the Crying Jordan meme. I would also bet he’s made a private promise to never put himself in that position again, for all the good it’ll do him, or whoever the future Crying Man will be. Five years passed between when that photo of Jordan was taken and when it became shorthand for a joke. That suggests the next Crying Jordan probably already exists.
One man who will not be the next Crying Jordan is Drake, who actively participates in his own meme-ing, whether he’s dancing like a dork or lint-rolling his pants. Drake knows that if you give your fans the full range of emotions, there’s no way you’ll ever be caught off guard by a shift in your public persona. When you’re constantly in motion, your context is always your own. (Take Prince, who’s one of the most secretive and most variegated celebrities of all time; upon signing up for Instagram, all he did was post Prince memes for a week.) As such, Drake is at the point where he can accidentally look like a loser, and save for a brief round of jokes, remain reputationally intact.
The best anyone else can do is pretend they weren’t hurt. “It was awesome,” said Ariana Grande when she was nearly plonked by the wing of a Victoria’s Secret model and captured looking like Wendy Torrance as Jack busts through the door with an ax. “I can’t make that face again,” said Jack White (allegedly) after looking like an over-it goth teen at a Chicago Cubs game. “But I’ll smile for you.” But my favorite rejoinder comes from Billy Corgan, who was seen looking very bummed during a trip to Disneyland: “What the fuck do you want from me?”
Years from now, when the history of the internet is studied in universities across the globe, students everywhere will raise their hands and ask, “Who was the Crying Man?” The wise professor will explain that it’s kind of complicated. He was the greatest basketball player of all time. He won six championships with the Chicago Bulls. But 15 years into the 21st century, his other accomplishments were pushed to the side by a photograph.
In this photograph, the greatest basketball player of all time is crying. His eyes are red, his cheeks puffed, his face slick with a torrent of tears. Internet users, some of them very funny in a way that was impossible to explain, figured out you could use this photo as a synonym for sadness — particularly, an easily mocked sadness. The Crying Man soon could be found everywhere. He was there when Ronda Rousey was knocked out for the first time, when the New York Mets lost the World Series, when the 2015–16 Los Angeles Clippers suffered a rough start to their seasons. Pretty soon, people forgot the Crying Man ever played basketball. For all his athletic superiority, he became just another casualty of the internet.
We’re still a while from that moment, but in 2015 it’s not insane to say that Michael Jordan, among the most famous people on the planet, is most relevant to youth culture thanks to the popularity of the Crying Jordan meme. And while he might be the most prominent, he’s not the only celebrity whose cry-face is as famous as any other. Kim Kardashian’s pinched sobbing is a pioneer in the field. “Dawson Creek crying” is the first result when you Google “Dawson’s Creek.” (James Van Der Beek has since attempted to turn various newly shot videos into intentional reaction GIFs, but nothing will ever beat his cry.) Selena Gomez, Lil Mama, Russell Wilson, Claire Danes, Chris Pine, Chrissy Teigen — their lachrymal dribbling is now part of our national lexicon. There don’t have to be actual tears for sadness to be repurposed for humor, either — Sad Jack White, Sad Billy Corgan, and Sad Keanu Reeves are evidence of that.
There is, apparently, a booming market in unmediated celebrity sadness, of which there has not been a historically available surplus. You don’t have to think very hard to draw a line from the collective thirst for celebrity sadness through the desire to take them down a notch. Celebrities: They’re so much richer and more famous than us! Why shouldn’t their aura be punctured?
It’s unavoidably cruel, in a way; it involves pointing fingers at someone because they had the temerity to appear unguarded in public. But today’s celebrities have greatly consolidated the access given to the outside world. An actor or a musician or an athlete doesn’t have to sit for an interview or detail themselves when asked. They can share a photo to Instagram with a lengthy caption, or tweet at their fans. When something that hasn’t been massaged to a milquetoast whatever is allowed to slip out from behind the veil, it’s genuinely fresh. If it’s something as raw as misery, it tastes like ambrosia.
This goes part of the way toward explaining the popularity of Crying Jordan, which is otherwise difficult to comprehend if your brain hasn’t marinated in raw internet. It also helps to be familiar with his career: The photograph was snapped during the 2009 ceremony where Jordan was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, during a notorious speech where he shit on his rivals and embarrassed his children before becoming briefly overwhelmed by the moment. It was first meme-ified in 2012, but it didn’t reach its apotheosis until 2015, when Crying Jordan was Photoshopped onto the head of anyone who had a reason to be sad in a public event. Triangulating the appeal of these things is imprecise, but it’s something about the juxtaposition of Jordan’s basketball immortality with the plain fact of how unappealing he looks here. He doesn’t just look sad — he looks enormously drunk, like he soiled himself while sitting on the train and decided to ride the rest of the route in abject misery.
BB-8 is already paying out huge meme dividends, and we expect the thumbs-up to reach higher heights when high-quality GIFs hit Tumblr in the coming year. We’re also bullish on Money Mouth Emoji — this one’s gonna be huge in 2016; the American economy is back — Happy Dog (for when you achieve your goals), and Drake.
Resignation
Resignation is a key component of any diversified meme portfolio. This year we love Minion on Fire, which combines minions and fire to really truly get at the moment when you give up on everything. Also recommended: Pope Francis (for when your friends need to go to church), Miss Colombia relinquishing the crown (for when you think you nailed it and then find out you didn’t), and Drake.
Skepticism
“Wait a minute,” you might be saying. “Wasn’t Why You Lyin’?” a 2015 meme? It’s true: You might have thought that this would die with 2015. But you’d be wrong. Don’t give up on blue-chip memes! Additionally, we think the skeptical reporter from Making a Murderer — for when the evidence doesn’t add up — is going places, and we “suspect” that the Sleuth Emoji is going to be the biggest emoji of 2015. (Whenever anyone says anything remotely suspect, just send this in response.) Also, Drake.
“It’s 2016 — what memes are you using?” That’s the question on everyone’s lips, from attractive babes to top taste-makers. Don’t have an answer yet? Don’t fret. Following has assembled several “starter packs” consisting of highly meme-worthy images to use when reacting to events in 2016 and placed them on Twitter at @ReactionPacks. See below for notes and explanations.
Anger
We’re forecasting big things this year for Star Wars villain Kylo Ren, whose god, mom mopey-goth face is perfect for when you’re mad about something you know you shouldn’t be mad about. We also recommend Angry Mr. Krabs, Nuclear Pepe, and Drake.
Confusion/Fear
Last year was a good one for confused Nick Young, but we don’t think he’s hit his ceiling — look for big things from the meme in the coming year. Additionally, 2015 latecomer meme confused Steve Harvey has the kind of market penetration most memes can only dream of. We’re also betting big on confused Donald Trump and confused Drake.
Happiness/Joy
The 2016 presidential campaign season, as we noted a couple of months ago, is shaping up to be the Vine Election. This is the first race in which we finally have a video platform perfectly suited to election season’s soundbite culture. What’s happened since we last checked in? Donald Trump went from “Hahahaha this guy won’t win” to “ha? ha? ha? ha? this guy won’t win? please?” He also locked down a key (??) endorsement from Sarah Palin and lost the Iowa caucus to Tedward Cruz.
Meanwhile, things are not looking so hot for Jeb Bush, heir to the Bush dynasty and perennial try-hard. He’s doing his best and it’s just not landing. Hillary and Bernie are locked in a closer-than-expected race, while that third guy who was always at the debates dropped out. Everyone’s been in Iowa trying to relate to the common people and all of this awkward hobnobbing has been captured via the news media and distorted and heightened on Vine.
Here’s what you missed.
A new iPhone app called Being, created by developer Adam Mashaal, allows you to view Instagram through the eyes of anyone with a public account. It does so by pulling the list of people your target is following and re-creating their Instagram timeline. It really is like “being” that person on Instagram — except that you can’t see their private messages or their friends with locked accounts, of course.
Why would you want to do that? Well, a Motherboard article about Being points to one way the app can be used: to satisfy our curiosity about how the famous and powerful use Instagram. (We’re clearly curious about this — people love to see the bizarro-world videos of what an Insta-famous celebrity’s phone looks like with notifications turned on.)
A presidential candidate’s Instagram experience would probably feel hollow to us, since few are personally using their accounts — they’re only following politically safe brands, organizations, and other politicians. More human celebrities, who tend to check and update their own accounts, follow just a handful of people they actually know. In those cases, Being could reveal cliques of close friends — some famous, some not. Being could, I suppose, also be used as a discovery engine. Find a tastemaker you trust, look at what they’re looking at on Instagram. Copy their style, friend their friends, blog about it. This seems like the most practical, although not the most interesting, revealing, or voyeuristic, way to use the app.
And then there’s the other way to use the app: to stalk your noncelebrity friends and acquaintances. Are the adult men you know exclusively following teenage bikini models, for example? Some people already inadvertently reveal this information by compulsively clicking “like,” not knowing those “likes” are public, but Being offers an even more unsettling way to look through the eyes of a creeper.
This reveals something important about how we think about privacy. On Instagram we tend to imagine our follower lists as private. But this isn’t a hard-coded setting, and Being isn’t making anything public that isn’t already being exposed through Instagram’s API (the interface that allows websites and apps to request data from the service). Theoretically, we knew when we signed up that anyone can see who we follow — we just trust that no one will be obsessive enough to reconstruct our personal social graph by hand. But Being takes all of the effort out of that process. It doesn’t expose new data; it just aggregates it differently, creating a new experience.
It’s tempting to say there’s nothing unsettling about Being because the information it collects is all public, but that goes down the slippery slope toward the most common, bad anti-privacy argument: “Why are you worried? Do you have something to hide?”
Is it a cool and edifying new way to understand other people online, or a borderline violation of privacy? Perhaps it’s both.
Smartphone battery-life hacks have become their own technology reporting beat, the inevitable result of a never-ending flood of Google searches like “iPhone battery life” and “iPhone battery dies too soon” and “god dam crap ass iPhone battery.” The latest craze in battery-life-saving is uninstalling your Facebook app — which The Guardian claims can increase the life of your battery by 15 percent on iOS, and others say can boost Android battery life by 20 percent.
This isn’t hugely surprising to hear: Facebook admitted last fall that its app could be a drain on phone battery life when describing some lingering bugs, including processes that would continually run in the background when the app was closed, even though they didn’t need to. (Facebook claimed that, contrary to popular belief, the poor battery performance had nothing to do with the app using a device’s GPS functionality.)
But while it’s possible that uninstalling Facebook completely can save battery, but there’s little definitive evidence. The methodology of the tests that led to The Guardian’s 15 percent is dicey: Keeping the phone off the charger for the exact same amount of time each day, Samuel Gibbs “used [Facebook] normally. I accessed Facebook for the same amount of time, and for the same purposes, using the social network’s excellent mobile site within Safari, as I had done using the app.” (Other testers used the same methodology and found the same battery-life savings.) But smartphone operating systems are increasingly complex beasts; depending on a million different factors — mainly usage of other software besides Facebook — the results could turn out differently. The overall idea of “normal usage,” identical from day to day, is a figment.
Which isn’t to say that Gibbs’s suppositions are wrong, merely to point out that they are suppositions. Facebook, more than most apps, is a many-tentacled platform with a zillion different technical processes to run continuously. It’s almost certainly the case that keeping software that taxes hardware off of your phone is better for battery life; the results of multiple tests hint as much. But many apps do this, and it can be hard to tell which of them is, in particular, draining your battery life — or what things it’s doing that are causing that kind of drain. Facebook might be terrible for battery life, but it’s not uniquely so. Should you delete it off your phone? Sure. You’ll probably see some improvement in your battery performance. But you’ll get that from deleting most apps off of your phone.
A sexy shirtless man running along Lake Michigan on Sunday night, his considerable muscles rippling in the rain, became the star of a local newscast and, shortly thereafter, the internet’s most eligible bachelor. Ethan Renoe, now known everywhere as “the shirtless wonder” thanks to Chicago’s WGN, is ripped, single, and trending on that little news box next to your Facebook feed.
“It’s really been crazy,” Renoe told WGN in a follow-up interview, during which he was unfortunately wearing a shirt, “I have about 900 friend requests right now.”
The original video has been viewed more than 1 million times in less than a day.
He had told WGN in his brief, rain-soaked interview that he was single, a fact he confirmed again Monday morning. He also clarified “for the record” that he’s straight. We also discovered that Ethan is a personal trainer, based in Colorado, who has glasses and a blog.
And on that blog, we learned that Ethan believes in God and is reconsidering his unsatisfying relationship with porn.
That all seems a little bit too complicated and human, though. The shirtless wonder was more fun when he was just a muscly vessel for the hopeless dream of getting in good shape in the middle of December.
If you’re interested in him, ladies, he invites you to get in touch on Twitter.
A week later, my friend browsed over to the Following tab, and there he was, stacking up bikini photo likes like a rat with a cocaine button.
Like most adults, I’ve frequently found myself lightly Insta-stalking in the evening as I procrastinate on sleep. I do my best to make sure I flick my scroll finger verrrry lightly so as not to accidentally like a 3-year-old “sexy” selfie of a friend of a friend of a friend I’ve never actually met; once, I wandered down a rabbit hole involving several years’ worth of photographs on the account of the unfamous tween child of a B-list comedian before suddenly realizing how weird that was. (He did magic tricks, though!) But I’d never reached the level of boredom, or stalkerdom, that led me to the Following tab on the Activity page — the place where you can see what posts the people you follow are liking.
Never, until a friend complained that not only was the guy she was dating constantly liking the swimsuit photos of random 17-year-old girls, but, as she breathlessly informed me, so were many of our mutual male friends and acquaintances! “Anytime you wake up early, just look,” she advised, shaking her head. “You won’t believe it.”
Suddenly, the Following tab became much more interesting. Armed with my new knowledge, I began to check out the activity feed first thing in the morning — and, sure enough, under the accounts of many of my male friends, a grid of photos of mostly un- or underdressed girls appeared! When I clicked through these photos, I’d find that each one had thousands of likes, and each woman would have at least tens of thousands of followers. And when I checked out their entire feeds (scrolling lightly!), every photo was the same: aggressively sexy, and drowning in a flood of likes.
It was a vast and troubling new world of Insta-stalking. It’s one thing to see the social-media self friends and acquaintances are consciously presenting. But it’s very different to watch your friends express themselves in ways you are pretty sure they don’t realize are public. Like a soft version of gaining access to pornographic searches, a close observer could even begin to pick out physical preferences: One person might be liking shots that focused on breasts, another mostly “fitness models.”
But the question I couldn’t answer was why, oh why, my friends and acquaintances felt the need go so far as to like the posts. It’s one thing to find yourself on an insomnia-fueled, libido-driven Instagram kick. But to like a post is to ask for attention from its creator. Liking says “Look at me, I exist! Pay attention to me!” Did my friends — smart men! Or so I thought! — actually think these girls were going to … respond? Reach out to them? Offer marriage? What, exactly, did they think was going to happen?
These were not guys whose public taste in women tended anywhere near the barely legal or barely clothed. These were dudes who went out with or married age-appropriate women — many of whom are my friends. Guys who had mostly eschewed stripper bachelor parties, even “ironic” ones. Guys who self-described as feminists. The Following tab had turned my life into Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Or a horrible gender inversion of What Women Want.
I started to see these friends differently. On the outside, they were normal dudes in their 30s, 40s, and 50s, running in the park while listening to Gimlet podcasts, picking up dinner ingredients at the Greenmarket, watching John Oliver … and then turning out the light and visiting a magical Instagram fairyland in which they make desperate pleas for attention from orange teenagers in Venice Beach. All the while, having no idea that anyone who followed them could see it all with a few taps.
After months of watching him and shaking her head, the friend who first pulled back the curtain on this for me finally told one of her close friends over dinner that everyone could see what he was doing on Instagram late at night. He freaked out and ran to the bathroom in order to unlike his most recent round of posts as fast as he could. He was grateful that she had told him before his wife found out, and she told him she never wanted to talk about it again. He agreed.
All because TFL was worried people would have trouble telling the difference between an image like this:
and an image like this:
And because TFL also apparently hasn’t heard of the Streisand effect, whereby a public attempt to silence something only results in more attention and popularity for that thing. If the people demand fake tube signs, there will be fake tube signs, whether there’s an app for that or not.
The London Underground’s whiteboard “service information” signs sometimes contain actual service information, but often contain inspirational quotes or cheeky messages. But recently, some amusing fake station signs have spread far and wide on social media, and London’s transportation agency, Transport for London, is not pleased.
The faux photo that seems to have incited TFL’s ire is this one, based on London’s new, unofficial anti-terror slogan: “#youaintnomuslimbruv.”
Timely, yes, but apparently not real, despite being portrayed as an official note from the Underground.
TFL couldn’t really stop fake images from spreading on Twitter, though. All it could do is go after the source — which, in a lot of cases, was a fun little website that let people create their own station sign images.
Developer Tim Waters said he got a legal threat from TFL Thursday. On Friday his little tube-sign app vanished, and he even deleted the code behind it from GitHub:
It’s a worn-out cliché to include a movie’s title as a crucial line in the film. It usually happens at a point of high drama, with a brief pause as the score swells to a crescendo, as if to ask, "Get it? Do you get it? See what I did there?" It’s so common that the internet’s largest cabinet of film and TV conventions, TV Tropes, has a very lengthy page listing every time it’s happened. They call it the title drop. But what if, after every title drop, the film just … ended?
Here’s your answer, in the form of a very excellent video by Chris Huebner:
Oh. Huh. Yeah, I guess that is what that would be like. Good thing we cleared that up.
French fashion house Louis Vuitton announced a new partnership this week with Square Enix, makers of the Final Fantasy series of role-playing video games, which also finally announced a high-definition remake of Final Fantasy VII earlier this year. No, not Chocobo-skin handbags.
Creative director Nicolas Ghesquière has revealed that Lightning, star of the role-playing video game Final Fantasy XIII, will be the face of the label’s spring-summer 2016 campaign. Controversially, Ghesquière did not say when the remake of Final Fantasy VII would be released — even though the fans have been asking for it for nearly a decade — and did not address concerns about the remake’s episodic structure.
All in all, this a win for anime, though. The partnership is just one more piece of evidence proving that anime is real, Mom, and that gaijin should stop making fun of it.
It might sound absurd for Amazon, the company most directly responsible for the slow demise of the brick-and-mortar bookstore, to open up hundreds of its own brick-and-mortar bookstores. But in actuality, it’s, well, yeah, it’s still kind of insane. And yet: Amazon is apparently opening hundreds of bookstores in malls around the country.
According to Sandeep Mathrani, the CEO of mall operator General Growth Properties, Amazon is planning on opening “300 to 400” bookstores this year. The comment was made in an earnings call earlier Tuesday. Amazon itself did not offer any additional comment to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, nor did a representative for GGP. If anyone would be clued in on the plans, the head of a mall operator seems a more likely candidate than most, but this item falls pretty squarely in rumor territory for now.
Amazon opened a single retail store last fall but has said little about why it did so or how successful the experiment was. (In addition to books, it also sold the company’s hardware offerings, including its line of Kindle e-readers and tablets, many of which are not particularly subtle attempts at tethering customers to the Amazon marketplace.)
It’s obvious that shopping online and shopping in person are fundamentally different experiences — and the institutional strengths that have made Amazon a formidable online retailer aren’t going to directly translate to selling books from a storefront: There’s no easy way to browse Amazon’s site as you would the shelves of a bookstore. Combining the impulse-buying of a physical space with the vast amounts of retail data that Amazon crunches every day is not the most absurd idea in the world. As much as e-commerce is now the default mode for many people, it’s tough to sell products to people who are not deliberately seeking them out.
If bookstores don’t play to Amazon’s strengths, leases on physical locations in cities might. Amazon, after all, built its empire on a peerless logistics network that allows it to move objects more efficiently and cheaply than any other institution on the planet, and new physical spaces could act as distribution centers for the online retail business (especially the burgeoning same-day delivery program). But even then, it doesn’t really make sense to pay high prices for commercial real estate — and use a lot of that space for retail display — when nearby warehouses would be cheaper and not add a significant amount of time to even same-day delivery.
There are, as the Journal points out, substantial considerations, the main one being that opening 300 to 400 retail stores is a years-long process with different cost considerations. For comparison’s sake, Barnes & Noble’s decades-old operation currently runs around 640 stores.
Sometimes, computers get things wrong. Sometimes, this is funny, but on occasion it is definitively not. A good example of the latter happened this week, when, thanks to an incorrect Google Maps entry, someone’s home got demolished.
The duplex belonging to Lindsay Diaz and Alan Cutter in Rowlett, Texas, was inadvertently torn down after Google Maps pinpointed 7601 Calypso Drive and 7601 Cousteau Drive, a block away, as being in the same place.
Diaz’s home, at Calypso Drive, was damaged by tornadoes in December, but was set to be repaired — not demolished. “We would have been in the house by the end of the summer. And then all of the sudden it’s like the tornado came through again, took everything,” she told TV station KERA.
According to TV station WFAA, the CEO of Billy L. Nabors Demolition, George Gomez, described the mix-up as “not a big deal.” It is the only comment the company has made, other than a screenshot an employee texted to Diaz that depicted Google’s incorrect mapping. Records indicate that the company has liability insurance.
The FBI’s sudden, unexpected request to delay their court hearing against Apple on Monday — they’ve supposedly found a new potential method of unlocking the phone — has raised a slew of additional questions. Chief among them are: What is the method and who is the third-party helping the FBI?
While that former question is still unanswered, the latter is reportedly the Israeli cybersecurity firm Cellebrite, characterized by Recode as “a leader in extracting information from mobile devices.” (The original report, from Israeli site Ynetnews, can be read here. Ynetnews is a subsidiary of the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, which, according to cybersecurity reporter Joshua Kopstein, has been “known to give free publicity to Israeli [companies].”)
Founded in 1999, Cellebrite serves “customers in the intelligence, public safety, military and enterprise industries with industry-leading, award winning mobile forensics solution components.”
Cellebrite has not commented on whether they are working with the FBI on cracking Syed Farook’s phone, but they do market a line of products called UFEDs (Universal Forensics Extraction Devices), which can supposedly unlock phones running iOS 8 or earlier. Farook’s phone is running iOS 9, so while their current public tools can’t unlock the phone, they likely are, or were, working on a method.
Cellebrite is not new to working with the FBI. According to public records reviewed by Motherboard, the FBI has ordered more than $2 million worth of equipment from them since 2012.
There has been some speculation on the method being used to access the phone, the most prevalent being mirroring the NAND chips in the phone (NAND is a type of logic gate that computers use). As cybersecurity expert Jonathan Zdziarski explains:
In other words, NAND mirroring is like a very complicated undo button that prevents the phone from logging incorrect passcode attempts, which would otherwise eventually wipe the phone completely. But of course, don’t expect the FBI to confirm any of these details anytime soon.
Today, while you can (and should) argue over the legality and ethicality of the NSA all day long, no one can argue that it’s bad at its job. It evolved. It adapted. It invested significant resources in its technological capabilities, and recruited gifted hackers from industry conferences like Def Con, and straight out of elite collegiate math programs. For five years, the NSA employed Charlie Miller, arguably the most gifted Apple hacker alive. (Miller now works at Uber.)
And that’s the way it should be. Security should never stop improving, and law enforcement’s ability to work around it, when necessary and court-approved, should be forced to improve in kind. The NSA has done a lot of unsavory things with its technological chops, but it has them, and it’s gone to great pains to achieve its level of institutional skill and knowledge — just as Apple and its peers have gone to great pains to make their technologies near-impenetrable. It’s an arms race, but it works: Companies are constantly improving their security, and the NSA isn’t guaranteed easy or universal access to private citizens’ data.
And then there’s the FBI.
“I have to hire a great workforce to compete with those cyber criminals and some of those kids want to smoke weed on the way to the interview.” That’s a 2014 quote from FBI director James Comey. At the time, his agency had been charged with hiring 2,000 additional personnel, including several with cybersecurity expertise; the FBI has a three-year ban on marijuana. This presented a problem.
It makes for a funny headline, but it’s also … true? At least in the broad sense, regardless of actual drug use, today’s hackers aren’t exactly a cultural fit with Quantico. At least the NSA — well, before Snowden — had some cultural cachet. They may be Big Brother, but they’ve got all the fun toys. The FBI, meanwhile, is what would happen if a literal overstarched suit were given life and tasked with creating a law-enforcement agency. Oh, and they also don’t pay all that great. At least not as well as Uber.
“Just as the NSA had to change in the late 1990s, so must the FBI,” Susan Landau, a professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (and co-author of “Keys Under Doormats”), testified to Congress earlier this month. “In fact, that change is long overdue.”
A better-equipped FBI would have helped this case, specifically. In fact, if the FBI hadn’t reset the iCloud password associated with the San Bernardino iPhone within a day of having it in possession, it would have had all the information it wants months ago. We could have avoided all of this entirely.
More important (since there’s almost certainly nothing of value on that one particular iPhone in the first place), an FBI that understands cybersecurity genuinely does make us all safer. Law enforcement shouldn’t be able to break into any phone whenever it wants. But not even Apple, which gives law enforcement access to the information on its servers all the time, would argue that digital “dark spaces” should be impregnable. But they should be dark, and accessing them should be difficult. It should take considerable resources. It should come with a court order. And ideally, it shouldn’t hinge on a third-party forensics contractor stepping forward with the solution.
Calling in a third-party cavalry still beats compelling Apple to help, though. It’s a good enough solution for now. The FBI gets the information it wants, and doesn’t get to set a precedent that would let it force other U.S. companies to weaken their security against their will. The FBI getting into this one iPhone is fine. And, hey! Maybe it found something useful after all.
The FBI shouldn’t, though, get to cheat. It shouldn’t be able to get Apple to do its homework for it, especially when there was so little to gain. It needs to smarten up. It needs to do its job.
After months of loudly insisting that there was simply no way to get into San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook’s discarded iPhone without Apple’s help, the FBI announced yesterday that it had successfully accessed the phone. It took the FBI and an unnamed third party one week to hack it. So much for impossible.
It’s hard to tell whether the FBI truly didn’t know until last week that the iPhone was hackable, or whether it decided at the last minute to back out of a precedent-setting case that it looked increasingly likely to lose. Either way, the San Bernardino iPhone case should never have gotten to this point. It should never have even started down this particular road. And it wouldn’t have, if the FBI were any good at its job.
The Apple–FBI fight has sparked healthy conversations around encryption, and dark spaces, and the primacy of a phone’s security versus court-approved searches. What it’s done most of all, though, is highlight the cybersecurity incompetence of our preeminent domestic intelligence agency. The FBI getting into that phone isn’t the real problem. It’s that it had to ask for a shortcut.
We’ve been through this before. Even if you don’t follow this sort of thing closely, you might have guessed that encryption isn’t a new concept. It’s been around for decades, as have various governmental attempts to get around it.
There’s no direct historical parallel to the FBI’s recent misadventures, but there have been similarly high-profile cases. Most notably, in the early ‘90s, the NSA created something called a “Clipper Chip,” a microchip meant to be embedded in consumer telephones that would provide encryption (good!) along with a built-in “backdoor” that would let government spies listen in at will (not so good!).
The reaction was largely the same then as it has been to the Apple case today. Privacy advocates yelped about state surveillance, as well as the program’s ultimate futility. In the same way the FBI has no control over Samsung or other companies based outside the U.S. today, the NSA couldn’t compel, say, Panasonic to sign up for a Clipper Chip in its landlines in the ‘90s. The bad guys, then, would just buy Panasonic. Within a year of the Clipper Chip reveal, a computer scientist named Matt Blaze found a vulnerability in its security measures that would have let anyone with enough hacking savvy break its vaunted encryption. The government killed the program before it really started.
The Clipper Chip exposed the real weakness of trying to take shortcuts with encryption: There are none. You can’t build a backdoor that only one person or agency has access to. Once it’s open, anyone with enough time, determination, and know-how can walk right through. A group of over a dozen computers scientists, including Blaze, made this point just last summer, in a definitive paper called "Keys Under Doormats." Handy metaphor!
It’s an instructive period not only because the government ultimately didn’t get what it wanted, but also because it pretty well devastated the NSA’s cybersecurity efforts for nearly a decade. Seymour Hersh outlined just how ill-suited the agency was for the age of encryption in a brutal 1999 New Yorker takedown titled “The Intelligence Gap.” Insular hiring practices and a refusal to evolve left the NSA practically flying blind.
How does it operate? What sort of technical setup are you working with?
I developed the mod using the Script Hook V library, which allows modders to get at functionality under the hood in Grand Theft Auto V. The computer streaming the live feed is really low-tech … it’s a 5-year-old gaming machine I picked up for $300 on Craigslist for another art project. Hence the sub-optimal graphics.
What’s the AI like for both the deer and others?
The deer activity is primarily based on what I believe is standard pedestrian AI in GTA V. I’m calling general functions that are available to a pedestrian, but then attempting to override occasionally so they don’t always follow what seems to be predetermined NPC [non-playable character] paths. Since I’m working through the Script Hook V library, I’m not sure what’s happening deeper in the code, but that’s my guess.
What grabbed my attention early in the development of the project was how the GTA V in-game world reacted to the deer and its random actions. The AI in the game is just so dense and nuanced. One of the early clips I recorded while testing exemplifies this, where the deer runs by a man on the street and he says, “What in the fucking world is that?”
Have there been any specific highlights you can recall? Anything funny?
One big highlight for me has been that I’ve been getting great feedback and responses from both the gaming community and the arts and new-media community. I’ve been really happy that the project has resonated with both, or at least given them a few minutes of amusement.
Watching the chat in Twitch has been really funny and bizarre. Twitch viewers have created a whole backstory/mythology: The deer is named Edgar. He’s looking for his wife, Virginia. He is battling a sea witch. I haven’t been able to keep up with how the story has progressed, but it’s been fascinating to watch.
Are you working on other animal cameras? What else would you like to see?
In what is surely the best possible use of their time, hundreds of people have spent the week watching a virtual deer run around a virtual city, occasionally getting into trouble but mostly doing nothing.
I’m working on several projects right now, some internet-based and some physical pieces. I’m working on a large-scale installation for the Bumbershoot Arts Festival in Seattle, which will happen on Labor Day weekend this year. That piece will incorporate robotic animals, projected birds, and holographic dogs trapped in an abandoned amusement park.
And regarding other animal cameras, I’m definitely working with some ideas regarding where this particular stream may go after 4/20/16.
Have you thought about letting the chat control the game, Twitch Plays X–style?
My dream would be for Rockstar to allow me to use this mod in GTA Online. I would love to see what happened to the deer with actual players. However, Rockstar (understandably) does not allow mods online, so I don’t imagine this happening.
Have you thought about giving the deer a gun?
I worked on a version where the deer caused explosions anytime something threatening approached [seen in the video above at the 1:24 mark], but I think it’s much more affecting and troubling and relatable to have the deer wander aimlessly and endlessly, with no ability to fight back, but also no ability to be harmed. There’s a Charlie Chaplin aspect to it, slapstick but tragic, with this innocent creature wandering and surviving in a hostile world.
The San Andreas deer cam, which operates inside a modded version of Grand Theft Auto V, is oddly compelling. Often the deer does nothing other than dart back and forth, but on an interval, the program warps it to different locations. This occasionally causes trouble, like when the deer catches the attention of gang members or the police (on Sunday, the deer successfully evaded a police manhunt).
In short, it’s interesting to see what happens to complex systems like GTA’s when you insert an invincible deer into any part of the environment. It’s fun to watch computers sabotage themselves.
The deer cam’s creator, artist Brent Watanabe, filled us in on how the project came about, and why it’s so compelling.
How did you come up with the idea for the deer cam?
I actually did this as an art project … I’ve been working on computer-controlled installations for over 10 years, and they all incorporate animals and man-made environments. Up until now, I’ve created all of the characters and code that drives the installations, but I got fixated on working in GTA V simply because it’s such a beautiful, vast environment. It’s like having access to a $65 million playground! The deer cam is not that different from another project I did years ago, where I built a video-game engine and set a duck loose in a computer-generated city.
I had never really seen much in GTA V until I watched my nephew Max playing. He showed me that you could find peyote and become an animal for a short amount of time (which is really hilarious to watch), and that’s when I decided to look into modding GTA V.
It might just be the Boston in him, but this little terrier really loves Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. The dog was not even alive when Mark Wahlberg, Hector the Booty Inspector, et al, released their seminal 1991 jam “Good Vibrations,” but when Marky Mark says “I command you to dance,” he takes the order very seriously. Good boy.
If we’re being honest, this is probably better than the original video. And the dog is probably a whole lot nicer than Marky Mark, who has a history of being a terrible, violent pile of garbage.
Thanks for the positive Tuesday vibes, dog.
Shia LaBeouf is heading into the end stretch of his three-day project to livestream himself watching every single one of his movies in reverse chronological order. Thursday afternoon, he watched his 2003 hit film Holes (he was 17 when it was made). He loved it! People on the Net also enjoyed it.
It’s completely normal for airlines to book stranded travelers into hotels when flights get delayed, but some hotels are more … interesting … than others. In China, two single ladies traveling together found themselves put up in a romantic, Fifty Shades of Grey-esque sex suite. On Valentine’s Day. Their very amusing story ended up all over Weibo, one of China’s biggest social networks.
The two women, who met with a weather delay while trying to fly from Chongqing to Hangzhou, posted photos of the room’s special features, notably a round bed and a sex chair with arm restraints dangling from it. They jokingly thanked the airline, Hainan, for arranging “a small Valentine surprise” for “two single unmarried girls.”
According to Chinese news site Sina, Hainan Airlines apologized “for any embarrassment” to the two passengers on social media. The company pointed out that hotels were fully booked because of the weather and Valentine’s Day, and said it didn’t know the room was so special.
At least they got a great story out of it.
This week, Twitter confirmed that, for a small subset of users of the mobile app, it’s testing a version of its basic product — the Twitter timeline — that doesn’t show posts in chronological order. This happens often; the company frequently runs quiet A/B tests on mobile. Twitter’s communications department told Motherboard that the move was an experiment. “We’re continuing to explore ways to surface the best content for people using Twitter,” they said.
Nevertheless, Twitter’s so-called “power users” — media, technology, and marketing types who read their feeds all day — freaked out. (It’s the latest in a long line of overwrought paranoia. Earlier this week, Twitter switched the locations of the moments and notifications menu buttons and civilization collapsed.) For people whose jobs revolve around obtaining and distributing information, Twitter’s greatest utility is its running feed — a newswire that makes it easy to watch news stories progress or provides an engaging second-screen experience for following events like award shows.
But the thing is, Twitter isn’t for power users. Or at least, if it wants to find a sustainable business, it shouldn’t be. Power users might understand retweets and subtweets and quoting tweets and the fav-like dichotomy, but all of these systems are tough to parse for users just now signing up for the service. Twitter has continually struggled with onboarding new users and introducing them to the various ways that they can interact with the timeline.
It’s very difficult to know what is important on Twitter because every post is given equal weight. For users who can’t check the service every hour (read: the vast majority of them), this is a problem. That’s why Twitter introduced the While You Were Away… feature. Earlier this week, they announced that photos would no longer be cropped until clicked on, removing yet another barrier to understanding what is happening on the timeline.
By mucking with the timeline’s chronology, Twitter can elevate posts that are important by an number of criteria; first showing you tweets with the most interactions or from friends you talk to the most, and then showing you everything else. It’s not a coincidence that this sounds like Facebook’s newsfeed algorithm, which caters to people who check Facebook once a day or even less frequently by elevating the posts most relevant to the user.
If Twitter has any chance of growing its base, it needs to find a way to cater to the users who aren’t on it all the time. The company’s “about” page boasts 320 million monthly active users. That’s the public metric by which they measure their user base. Can you — someone who is right now reading a blog post about the intricacies of Twitter — even imagine checking your timeline only once a month? Probably not, but the majority of usage habits likely skew toward that end.
Twitter changes, or it dies. Those are the two options. If everyone used Twitter like the media uses Twitter, there would be no need to mess with it. The fact remains that the media is just a small and outsize vocal minority in Twitter’s user base.
Matthew Santoro, a popular YouTuber whose educational comedy videos regularly top 1 million views, released a video with a more serious tone Sunday, describing his experience in what he says was a physically and emotionally abusive relationship. He claimed he had recorded the video for himself in September, but accidentally made it public, and when his fans noticed, he decided to leave it up. Further complicating matters, his allegedly abusive ex is also a YouTuber, and she claims his story was made up for attention.
After being fired from a gig as — irony of ironies — the choreographer of a body-positive teen dance movie, Arbour spun the mean video as a marketing ploy. She told Cosmopolitan last month that “Dear Fat People” and other outrage-baiting rants in the same vein (e.g., “Dear Instagram Models”) had earned her five figures and jump-started her career.
“I’ve got a bunch of really cool TV offers coming my way right now, and lots of sponsors coming to me to make cool videos for them, branded content for them, or ad campaigns for them. Just lots of stuff coming in,” she said.
She also released her first single, “Monstar,” the day after “Dear Fat People,” but told Cosmo it was a joke and “not the actual release.” (Perhaps because it is very bad.)
Calculated exploitation of people’s insecurities for YouTube views and financial gain might make Arbour a cynical Mean Girls caricature — or someone who plays one on the internet — but it doesn’t necessarily make her an abuser.
She denied and mocked Santoro’s claims on Twitter Tuesday, writing, “Damn right I beat him!! …at Scrabble, Wii, chess, pretty much everything!!” and “If you are being abused, get help. If you are making up lies to get back at someone for breaking up with u six months ago. Also get help.”
She also attacked Santoro in the comments of one of her videos, writing, “Heard that little bitch I dumped months ago is still trying to use me to get attention on his vlog channel. Ew.”
(Santoro’s main YouTube channel has about 5 million subscribers, Arbour’s has around 200,000.)
The story is he-said-she-said at this point, with the exception of an interview given back in September by one of Santoro’s close friends and fellow YouTuber Rob Dyke. Dyke’s story matches up precisely with the events Santoro mentioned, but goes into more detail, including claiming that police got involved at one point. However, he doesn’t claim he was present for the incident of alleged physical abuse, so he’s taking his friend’s word for that part of the story.
It’s impossible for an outside observer to know who’s telling the truth, but what we know for sure is that this entire situation is horrible (and it’s now playing out in public). Either it’s a case of domestic abuse that carried on unreported for months, or it’s a case of YouTubers attempting to tank each other’s careers by manipulating public sentiment. The only favorable outcome is that these two both get on with their lives and that this tragic incident — in whichever way it turns out to be tragic — encourages victims of abuse to recognize the signs and look for help.
In the video, Santoro is on the verge of tears as he describes how his ex forced him to push away the other people in his life, isolating him from his family and closest friends.
“This individual I was with was extremely jealous, viciously jealous,” he says. “If I had a female friend, I must have been cheating on her with them.”
He claims that when he tried to leave the relationship after having a panic attack one night, the emotional abuse escalated into physical abuse — that when he tried to leave this woman’s home, she stopped him and hit him in the face.
A month later, he says, he took her back — but she continued to be controlling and manipulative.
“Domestic violence knows no gender,” he says. “It happens to men and women.”
And then, crying, he continues: “And it’s something that men never talk about, because we’re made to believe that we’re supposed to be strong. I never talked about it because I thought that no one would believe me, no one would give a shit, and it’s sad that we live in a society where people have to feel like they’re supposed to keep quiet about these things. And it’s wrong.”
Santoro doesn’t name his alleged abuser, but he was known to be dating another YouTuber, Nicole Arbour. Arbour is largely (sorry) known for her video “Dear Fat People,” a controversial and unfunny series of observations about overweight individuals that somehow goes on for six minutes.
It’s hard being a cat. Sometimes you’re just trying to get your head unstuck from a vase, so you break the vase, but part of the vase is still hanging around your neck like a fancy ancient-Egyptian collar, and suddenly you’re the most popular thing on Reddit but you still have to go to the vet. Oh, the indignity!
They’re calling this unfortunate little guy “Cleo-catra” on Reddit, but the original poster of the photos says his real name is Jax.
Other than being humiliated by many Egyptian history puns and a few good Photoshops — which, let’s be honest, Jax doesn’t care about because he is a cat — Jax is doing fine. His vet was able to remove the vase from his neck with a wire saw.
“Long story short, we were raised very religious, but things they were doing were very unorthodox.”
Growing up in the 1990s, Benny was obsessed with his tape recorder, conducting interviews and making his own radio shows. The brothers started recording comedy sketches as adolescents, when they got their first video camera. Benny, who’s two years older, roped in the younger Rafi to produce their videos with him. Their early efforts included hour-long stories starring their action figures.
Their first online videos came out in late 2004, according to a Bloomberg profile. Despite the early web’s lack of any centralized platform to watch videos, the Fines claimed some modest success. “Their shows attracted hundreds, then thousands, of viewers, and they developed a stable of serialized shows,” Bloomberg reported.
“The early efforts included a 12-episode mock reality-TV show called ‘Garage Sale,’ which featured various items from the brothers’ garage pleading not to be sold. Viewers would vote each week, and the loser would be listed on EBay — and was usually bought by a fan of the show.”
And then, in 2005, came YouTube. The Fines entered the fledgling YouTube community as low-paid video producers for other companies, but kept making their own videos on the side. They moved from New York to L.A., and held down day jobs while they built their YouTube following. Benny worked as a ride operator at Disney parks — making “absolute shit” for pay — to make ends meet.
The Fines told Rhett and Link that they didn’t even move into separate apartments until almost a decade into their mutual entertainment career, because they just didn’t have time — “every waking moment is dedicated to creating content.”
The Fines’ big break arrived in 2009, when they joined up with a new venture called Maker Studios, a collaboration between some of the top YouTube stars of the time, including Philip DeFranco and Shane Dawson.
“We always thought we would never become some bigger thing on YouTube. We always wanted to work for like, a CollegeHumor,” Benny said.
So they talked to Dawson about what they could do with Maker, and “within two months, we were the head of production and head of creative,” writing and producing for many of the studio’s high-profile channels.
Maker Studios would go on to expand into an enormous multi-channel network, home to some of the most popular YouTubers. Maker sold out to Disney in 2014, for more than $500 million. Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg, the wacky video gamer who’s literally the most popular thing on YouTube, just launched his own gaming network within Maker. He made a reported $12 million last year.
Benny and Rafi Fine, the 30-something YouTube stars known as the Fine Bros., have built much of their fame and success on videos of kids reacting to things. They updated the successful formula of Kids Say the Darndest Things for the YouTube generation and branded it as their own, and it was a huge hit. And why not? Videos of kids reacting to things appeals to two of the most important demographics online: kids themselves, and the all-powerful “Facebook moms,” the most prolific and reliable social sharers. The Fines and “Kids React” were two of YouTube’s most beloved brands.
But Maker did all of that without the Fine Bros., who left in 2010 after things at the studio “stopped matching up with what we believed in,” the brothers explained. They wanted to be part of a “bunch of united artists growing and promoting people together,” not just “a content business.” Late that year, they cashed in their savings and struck out on their own as full-time YouTubers.
The Fines would go on to have their own success, albeit not quite on PewDiePie’s level. They’d had some viral hits during their pre-Maker days, notably a long-running series spoofing the TV show Lost, and a video where they recited 100 movie spoilers in five minutes. The “Spoiler Alert” was a formula worth at least a couple million views, and it’s one they’ve reused successfully throughout their YouTube career, spoiling movies, TV shows, and video games.
But it wasn’t until after they left Maker that they hit on their biggest winner: reaction videos. The first in the series, “Kids React to Viral Videos #1,” came out in October of 2010, and currently has more than 5 million views.
It was the start of a small empire: Kids reacted to viral videos, YouTube stars, and Lady Gaga. They reacted to Star Wars. They reacted to the short-lived and dumb “planking trend.” And soon, kids became teens, and they were reacting, too. Every reaction video was racking up hundreds of thousands of views, and the Fines kept finding new things to do with the format. In mid-2012, they launched Seniors React — now called Elders React.
And after highlighting the disconnect between old people and modern technology and pop culture, it only made sense to show how mystified kids are by outdated technology. The best Kids React videos are the ones where kids try to figure out how to operate Walkmen, rotary phones, and original Game Boys. These segments are basically internet crack, hitting all the same “remember the ‘90s?” notes that make BuzzFeed’s millennial nostalgia listicles so successful.
Which brings us to the present day: The Fines’ React videos are so popular that they’ve been moved to their own separate channel with more than 5 million subscribers. The Fine Bros. empire has been formalized as a company — a natural and necessary step when you’ve got all that revenue — with more than 50 employees. They keep coming up with new ways to mine the React concept for content — most recently, React Gaming.
And despite their leaving Maker because they didn’t want to be part of a monolithic content company, there was this month’s controversial, explosive React World announcement. The Fines proposed to farm out the business of finding new reactors and new things for them to react to, bringing every video in the format under their own trademarked umbrella.
“Not being a mega corp and unable to go global ourselves, we have decided to give access to all these series to the world to create that collaboration together,” the Fines wrote on Medium when they announced the project.
That collaboration, it should be noted, would have resulted in Fine Bros. Entertainment raking in “20 percent of all ad revenue, and 30 percent of all brand deals” from any licensed spinoff React channels.
But this week, they found themselves at the center of a complex and murky online controversy when they tried to take the not-so-secret sauce that earned them nearly 20 million viewers across two popular channels — the “React” formula — and franchise it out to other video creators. They trademarked “React,” announced a brand bible for reaction videos, and offered revenue sharing and avenues for other people’s reaction videos to get traffic. Basically, they acted like a company instead of part of YouTube’s creative community. And over the weekend and into Monday, they were pilloried for it across YouTube and Reddit by people who feared the Fines would take down competing videos to protect their new “React World” brand.
There was also a format bible, including graphical elements to use “so everyone watching knows we are all in this together.”
But everyone wasn’t in it together. Consolidating a brand and protecting the value of a trademark necessarily means forcing out competition, taking down videos that could be confused for the Fines’ most recognizable product but don’t give the Fines a cut of the revenue, and that worried other YouTubers. Especially because takedowns had reportedly already started to happen.
On Reddit, the Daily Dot noted, “people are beginning to dredge up examples of the Fine Bros. allegedly shutting down videos that shared similarities with their brand. One such video, titled ‘Seniors React,’ was posted before the Fine Bros.’ first Elders React video in 2012, but has since been removed from YouTube.”
Another YouTuber claimed his video had been taken down by the Fines after getting just eight views.
The Fines quickly moved into damage-control mode over the video takedowns, some of which appeared to be unintentional. They promised in the YouTube description on an update video Sunday that they would work to restore the mistakenly removed videos in the coming week. Now, with the cancellation of React World, they’ve dropped all their Content ID takedown claims.
“The concerns people have about React World are understandable, and that people see a link between that and our past video takedowns,” they wrote Monday, “but those were mistakes from an earlier time.”
The Fine Bros. trademark on “React” was probably the biggest point of contention in the YouTube community, for obvious reasons: “Trademark” brings to mind the threat of legal action, of corporate overlords deleting the videos of tiny individual creators. But the legal system actually has very little to do with the daily realities of YouTube, where video takedowns can be notoriously like a sentence without a trial.
YouTubers complain that the site’s automated Content ID system is extremely easy to abuse, and hard to challenge once the machines have made their ruling. A mistake can take days or weeks to fix, and you can be without your video or your entire channel during that time. For those who depend on YouTube ad revenue, it’s especially terrifying. As popular YouTube ranter I Hate Everything put it, the system “is a joke!”
So, even if the Fines nobly intended to expand the universe of React videos — and profit in doing so — the fear is that they would end up monopolizing the entire concept of “people reacting to things” on YouTube.
“These guys didn’t come up with the idea of filming funny reactions from kids. And they certainly don’t own an entire genre of YouTube videos. It wasn’t their idea, and it’s not theirs to own or police,” wrote “video game attorney” Ryan Morrison, who planned to file a legal challenge to the Fines’ “React” trademark.
On Monday night, with their subscriber numbers dropping, the Fines realized the project as they’d envisioned it probably couldn’t be salvaged. They posted an apology on Medium and agreed to rescind their trademarks, cancel React World, and release all their past claims through YouTube’s Content ID copyright enforcement system.
He won’t have to file it now. The trademark and React World are dead. And that’s a shame, because it was an interesting idea that suffered from tone-deaf execution.
As Hank Green, one half of YouTube’s Vlogbrothers, put it earlier this week, “this could actually be a very cool project if it could be divorced from the idea of two very powerful creators attempting to control a very popular YouTube video format. Franchising one of YouTube’s biggest shows? Yeah, I’d love to see how that goes.”
A lot of YouTubers probably would have loved it, too, if it hadn’t seemed so much like a legal threat to them. The Fines exist in a middle ground between small-time solo creators and massive Maker Studios. Their company has around 50 employees to support, which means they’re probably past the point where “two guys making videos” is a viable business model. There are other YouTubers in that same territory, and they’re not all going to be bought by Disney for half a billion bucks. There has to be a way forward for a small business on YouTube, not a “mega corp,” as the Fines put it. And the Fines may have found it in the franchise model.
“Two guys making videos” can’t support a growing company, but a whole bunch of guys making videos, paying a small percentage in exchange for traffic and branding? There’s probably something there.
It seems very likely that a YouTube icon will blaze that trail in the next year or two, but it probably won’t be a Fine Brother.
How did we get here? How did the Fines go from two Orthodox Jews from Brooklyn who “didn’t know anybody” to YouTube’s favorite stars, and now to the internet’s favorite pariahs of the moment?
The Fines gave the definitive interview about their early YouTube career two years ago on Ear Biscuits, a podcast by fellow YouTube personalities Rhett and Link.
“The whole upbringing was interesting because we grew up Orthodox Jews all the way until we were teenagers,” Benny said.
“But the story before that, just quickly,” Rafi cut in, “is that both of our parents grew up on the West Coast. Jewish families, Jewish history, everything. Nobody Orthodox. They were big hippies, and our father was really into, like, LSD.”
The brothers spin a tale of their parents’ decision to become Orthodox Jews — but remain undercover hippies — after a trip to Israel. The Fines’ parents moved to Brooklyn in the early ‘80s, and Benny and Rafi were born just as their father had decided to go “all in” and become a rabbi.
Doctors tweeting doesn’t sound like a particularly big issue, or even a thing — shouldn’t they be, like, operating? — and normally, it isn’t. But, like the rest of the internet, Doctor Twitter is becoming overrun with sponsored content — and an investigation by Stat News has found multiple doctors who regularly tweet (or otherwise post to social media) promoting products made by companies who pay them often tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for “consulting” and never disclose that fact in or immediately following the endorsement.
While there’s no obligation for doctors to disclose previous payments from these companies on social media, a provision of the Affordable Care Act requires doctors to disclose payments from drug and medical companies to the Department of Health and Human Services, which posts those on a public website. Multiple studies have shown the detrimental effects of “consulting” money from such companies on doctors, though the doctors identified with Stat all either saw no issue with it or didn’t respond. According to a user-friendly, non-governmental database of the Health and Human Services filings created by ProPublica, 1,630 companies paid out over $3.5 billion between August 2013 and December 2014 to some 681,000 doctors nationwide.
“It’s become very unwieldy and problematic and it’s ridiculous for a tweet,” James Simon, a D.C. gynecologist who regularly tweets enthusiastically about Addyi, which you might know better as the “female Viagra,” told Stat. Simon has received nearly $500,000 from medical companies between August 2013 and December 2014, the months the data are currently available for, and worked as a consultant on developing Addyi for Sprout Pharmaceuticals for an undisclosed sum. Addyi debuted in June to disappointing results; women who use it are reporting, on average, half of one more sexually satisfying encounter per month.
Stat also found that Dr. James Underberg, a clinical assistant professor at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, has tweeted in promotion of Zetia, a cholesterol-lowering drug that paid him nearly $40,000 between 2013 and 2014 in promotional-speaking fees. Underberg told Stat, “I applaud the state of Massachusetts. It’s not an unreasonable request. If New York made such a rule, I’d comply with it.” The Medical Center did not respond to a request for comment by press time. In a statement, the Medical Center said, “NYU Langone requires all compensated faculty to disclose their payments from outside activities and to disclose those interests in academic publications and educational lectures, where appropriate. While our policy does not require its physicians to disclose payments from outside activities online or in social media specifically, it is the expectation that faculty will disclose their industry relationships when appropriate. We are currently reviewing our policies as they relate to social media.”
Shrek occupies the same space in my mind as, I’d guess, Good Charlotte? Like, in retrospect, it’s bad, but at the time, it was good. From 2001 to 2006 or so, I think everybody loved Shrek. He was cheeky and bawdy and didn’t take no crap, but he not-so-secretly had a heart of gold. Fifteen years ago, mixing contemporary pop culture (e.g., Smash Mouth’s “All Star”) with classic fairy tales was inventive. Now, “Disney Princesses As …” is a behemoth genre of viral content unto itself. Shrek, in some ways, kickstarted the mash-up culture that is now the internet’s lingua franca.
Despite Shrek’s clear popularity among social media’s most avid users, his creators are less aware of their impact. Terry Rossio, one of four screenwriters who contributed to the first film, says, “Usually I am full of opinions. But in this case … no, I’m not familiar with the meme subculture. And I don’t quite know what to make of it.”
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius
Though you have to look a bit harder, Jimmy Neutron is revered in a similar, post-ironic way. The Facebook page Why helo it is i jimbles notronbo — 116,000 likes strong — has been serving up grammatically incorrect Bizarro Jimmy speech for two and a half years.
Neutron, like Shrek, also has his own poorly animated machinima fan film.
Of the three films nominated for the first Best Animated Feature award, Jimmy Neutron has probably aged the most poorly, in part because the film was meant to launch an animated series on Nickelodeon. The ensuing result on the memescape is two-fold: There is an entire series’ worth of material to mine for memes and jokes, and TV animation budgets are thriftier than a major motion picture. In other words, there is a lot of crappy Jimmy Neutron material out there, all of which is regarded with a nostalgic fondness by a larger-than-you-think subset of teens.
In 2001, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided to create a new Oscar category, Best Animated Feature. The award and the prestige it held came at an interesting time for Hollywood, which was aggressively, but also reluctantly, transitioning away from hand-drawn 2-D animation and toward 3-D computer-generated imagery. Just six years prior, the first Toy Story took the world by storm. The Academy had long neglected animated films (it was a big deal when Beauty and the Beast was nominated for Best Picture), which for the most part were aimed at young children and did not carry any prestige.
Monsters, Inc.
The ironic appeal of Shrek and Jimmy Neutron is further typified by our last Oscar nominee, Monsters, Inc., specifically the character Mike Wazowski. One of the most popular blogs on Tumblr is Blurry Pictures of Mike Wazowski, which features exactly what it sounds like. Freeze-frames of Monsters, Inc. that capture Mike in awkward and unflattering poses. In the process, Mike has become a Tumblr demigod, another vessel through which the young and anxious channel their neurotic tendencies.
It’s easy to browse through the glut of Mike Wazowski content on Tumblr and respond to every meme, every macro with “me irl.”
Which brings us to the crux of the matter: All three of these films look terrible. The early 2000s computer-animation boom was cutting-edge at the time, but now looks extremely dated. All of the textures look plastic-y, facial expressions are uncanny. The embrace of crappy computer-generated imagery is at once nostalgic fondness (“reminds me of childhood!”) and rebuke (“looks like shit!”).
What was once cutting-edge is now crappy and busted. Have you watched a Shrek film recently? The brash, edgy vibe of 2001 doesn’t really fly anymore, nor does the animation quality of Jimmy Neutron, which was spun off into a television series. Monsters, Inc., by virtue of being a Pixar film, has aged the best, but it still looks dated by comparison. For a crowd of people (millennials, one might say), who came of age online in the early ‘00s, ridiculing these outdated relics is a way of paying tribute. And 14 years ago, the Oscars did exactly the same thing, but with complete sincerity and terrible CGI.
But all of that changed at the 74th Academy Awards, when three films were nominated for the first Best Animated Feature Oscar. Not by coincidence, those three films — Shrek, Monsters, Inc., and Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius — are also major players in the modern memescape. Shrek might have taken top honors, but all three films have had odd internet afterlives.
Shrek
Shrek is the most visible hustler in the meme game. “Shrek is love, Shrek is life,” as the saying goes. Articulating why Shrek continues to appeal to the Tumblr crowd in 2016 is tough to articulate. Shrek movies, once a financial bulwark for Dreamworks, have since stalled out. Shrek 2, which until recently held a spot in the top-ten highest-grossing movies of all time, made $440 million domestically, but the fourth installment, Shrek Forever After, took in a little more than half of that. A spinoff Puss in Boots film barely made back its production budget, and was almost certainly a loss for the studio when factoring in the accompanying marketing push.
Yet for forms of comedy native to the web — the detached, self-deprecating voice often seen on Tumblr and in pockets of Twitter — Shrek never left. The rise of Shrek is relatively recent, stemming from a single NSFW post on 4chan that has since spiraled into a full-on fandom, a parody of brony culture in which die-hard Shrek fans refer to themselves as “brogres.” For a short while, they even had their own imageboard, known as ShrekChan.
Christmas, a holiday that celebrates the traditional values of family, eggnog, and copious overspending on consumer goods, added something new to celebrate this year: people unwrapping those “hoverboards” that don’t actually hover and then immediately falling off of them. Hoverboard companies and emergency rooms both did brisk business this joyous holiday season.
In 2011 and 2012, comedy goon Jon “@fart” Hendren retweeted the complaints of loathsome children who cursed their parents for not giving them the latest iPhone on Christmas. That particular stunt has run its course, but here’s its comedic successor: weird twitterer @foucault_45 spending Christmas morning retweeting holiday hoverboard accidents.
And Gizmodo reporter Kate Knibbs rounded up even more (so many more) of these abject yuletide failures.
Truly, a hoverboard is a great gift — not just to its new owner, but to all of us. If only there were video.
Of course there’s video, because Santa is real and you’ve been very good this year. BuzzFeed collected numerous “hoverboard xmas fails” from Instagram over the weekend.
This entry, I think, succinctly sums up the whole phenomenon. And perhaps this entire year.
The Dab is not quite dead, but it’s almost there. A lot of boring, old people have done their best to try to kill the Dab and bury it deep underground.
But there are a brave few keeping the Dab alive. Among them, whoever is in the Squidward costume in this Vine.
Squidward feels no joy in this Dab, but he will do it. Because the people demand it. They want the Dab. They need the Dab. And so he soldiers onward, stoic and committed. To Dabbing.
Unsurprisingly, the half-second of Squidward Dabbing was still enough footage to turn the incident into a minor meme.
In his verse on “Diamonds From Sierra Leone,” Jay Z raps, “I’m not a businessman, I’m a business, man!” This week, it appears that at least the first half of that statement is true. According to Bloomberg, the rapper is claiming that the company that sold him streaming service Tidal inflated subscriber numbers.
In an emailed statement, the company said that it had been duped by Norwegian media company Schibsted ASA. “It became clear after taking control of Tidal and conducting our own audit that the total number of subscribers was actually well below the 540,000 reported to us by the prior owners,” they wrote.
Tidal, which has no free streaming tier, has struggled since its inception to attract subscribers. Its initial pitch — a fairer business model to benefit artists — was agreeable enough, but when the faces of the streaming service are A-list multimillionaires, the call to support artists rings a little flat. Executive leadership has also been a revolving door.
The service has, however, received a substantial uptick in subscribers — more than three million now — since Kanye West’s most recent album, The Life of Pablo, launched on the service exclusively. Likewise, Beyoncé’s latest single, “Formation,” is Tidal-only.
Schibsted, for its part, denies that they cooked the books, saying that Jay Z’s company performed due diligence before the sale was finalized.
It was so uncontroversial that many Indians jumped on the thread to suggest that maybe the consequences of colonialism, and not India’s eventual independence from British rule, are to blame for India’s current economic system. Weird. It’s almost as if people have their own opinions about what’s good for their country and don’t like to be condescended to by Silicon Valley money-men.
Anyway, despite recent regulatory rulings against Free Basics, Facebook will probably continue to look for ways to assimilate the world’s second-largest country into its social-network Borg collective. I mean, nobly connect the global poor to the internet in a benevolent and non-colonial fashion.
Update: At around 5pm Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg distanced himself from Andreessen’s comments, writing that they “do not represent the way Facebook or I think” about India.
Facebook has run into trouble trying to get its Free Basics internet service into India because it violates Net Neutrality by giving away some applications — like Facebook — for free, while others are subject to data charges. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been persistent in his attempts to finesse an argument for Free Basics in the face of protests, but on Tuesday night, one of Facebook’s board members undid Zuck’s PR work by … well, by seemingly … defending … colonialism? Oh boy.
Marc Andreessen, a prominent venture capitalist and angry Twitter egg, wrote that “anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now?"
Silicon Valley, always looking to disrupt our entrenched preconceptions, is now trying to disrupt our preconception that Gandhi was right.
After his name started trending in India due to all the Twitter backlash, Andreessen apparently decided his white man’s burden had become too heavy and deleted the tweet.
You know you’ve messed up when you have to make a public statement clarifying that you’re actually against colonialism.
Benedict Evans, an analyst with Andreessen Horowitz who recently became an internet punching bag after he complained that San Francisco lacks an “amazing carpet shop,”was quick to defend Andreessen’s colonialism tweet as “utterly uncontroversial.” (He references “the Hindu rate of growth,” an outdated term that attempts to lay India’s slow rate of economic growth from the 1950s through the 1980s at the feet of Hindu cultural factors.)
Next step, draw the geofence. That’s relatively simple, since the interface uses Google Maps and you just have to click boundary vertices. I chose … my office.
But there was a problem. My filter was going to cost nearly $300. I am a troll, but I am not a rich troll, so I went back to the time-selection screen and dropped it to two hours, which would run me $25. Not great, but about the same cost as two tickets to a movie. The Verge reports that “The filters start at $5, which is the approximate price for an eight-hour Friday event in a major city,” but New York’s hourly rate seems waaaay higher than that. Snapchat filters, just like everything from food to movie tickets to rent, are significantly more expensive in Manhattan.
After that was finished, I plugged in my credit-card info, hit submit, and crossed my fingers. I was initially worried that my Pepe usage would get my design rejected, but his meme status is apparently cemented now (Pepe’s creator, for the record, is cool with the memes).
Snapchat is promising a one-day maximum turnaround on filter approval. Mine was approved in four minutes.
My design is stupid, but I played it safe my first time out. I wonder what might have happened if my filter said something like “My editor smells like farts.” (Other than me getting fired.) Would it have been approved? Snapchat’s guidelines don’t say anything about unflattering remarks, though you can’t use logos that you don’t own.
But it’s hard not to see the raw trolling potential here: Maybe someone will put a geofence around the New York Stock Exchange, or put a “Mets suck!” filter around Citi Field. It’s a brave new world. To see what it’s like, try to Snapchat from the New York offices this Friday.
Snapchat’s geofilters — cutesy filters you can apply based on your location — are one of its defining features, yet until now they’ve all been first-party. Snapchat itself created and defined the parameters of when filters appeared, and only major events or sponsorships could break through that barrier. Until now.
Starting this week, anyone can buy a custom geofilter, creating the art themselves and defining the duration and the geofence in which it is contained. Snapchat imagines people buying on-demand filters for birthday parties and such:
Birthday parties are nice, but I immediately gravitated toward a more important and vital usage: trolling. To test this, I spent five minutes making the dumbest filter I could think of and then tried to buy placement for it.
Snapchat was kind enough to do some of the heavy lifting by supplying a few Photoshop templates. I picked a jazzy variant, flipped the font to Comic Sans, and threw in a few Pepes — the cartoon frog whose sad/smug visage is instantly recognizable to dedicated consumers and creators of memes. The Pepes were tough to wrangle because filters have a strict 300 kb size restriction, which is very small. Filters need to be relatively simple. This is likely due to the fact that they download automatically, so speed is key.
After the upload, I then had to choose a date. I selected all of Friday, February 26.
Today in internet stories you wish were true but are sadly just another viral joke a bunch of websites misinterpreted as news: The contract that pharmaceutical-industry manipulator Martin Shkreli signed to buy Wu Tang Clan’s new album for $2 million does not actually include a proviso that the Clan can steal it back with the help of Bill Murray, as a viral tweet suggested.
Storyful reports that Rob Wesley’s original tweet of contract text allowing for “one (1) heist or caper to steal back Once Upon a Time in Shaolin … undertaken by currently active members of the Wu-Tang Clan and/or actor Bill Murray, with no legal repercussions” was, unfortunately, fake. The real tell: Wesley’s account is full of jokey Photoshopped documents and “oral histories.”
We all wish Martin Shkreli would get some kind of payback for his relentless pursuit of any and all media attention, but it’s not going to be the next Ocean’s 11. But maybe the guys will take inspiration from the tweet and do it anyway?
A scenario: You have just won some sort of contest or giveaway. The giveaway requires you to go somewhere, likely a website, and enter a random, one-time-use alphanumeric code in order to redeem your prize.
Do you … (A) redeem the code and claim your prize (B) not redeem the code, brag about your winnings by posting a photo of the code on social media
A Canadian woman who won a $100 Tim Hortons gift card chose the latter option. Margaret Butler Coward was so excited about winning a prize in the coffee chain’s annual Roll Up the Rim contest that she posted a photo on Facebook, allowing some coldhearted monster to redeem the code before her.
Luckily, this story has a happy ending. Tim Hortons has decided to give Butler Coward her prize anyway. “Try to think twice before you post something, because it really can come back and kick you in the butt,” she told the CBC.
It’s been a rough month for social-media burglary victims. A few weeks ago, some enterprising teens went around Twitter harvesting coupons for free Chipotle.
At a concert in Melbourne, Australia, last night, a man named David Spargo was able to get backstage by convincing a security guard that he was related to the electronic duo Peking Duk. The evidence: He was listed as family on their Wikipedia page.
The security guard waved Spargo through and he made it all the way to the green room. “We ended up having a bunch of beers with him and he was an absolute legend. He wasn’t a creep or anything. He was like the most normal dude we’ve ever met. That’s what makes it more hilarious,” group member Adam Hyde told the Guardian.
The band posted about it on Twitter and Facebook using a meme from the film Anchorman.
Spargo responded very politely on Facebook.
New Jersey assemblywoman Pamela Lampitt wants to ban texting while walking, to which I say: Haha, good luck, chump.
First things first: Texting while walking can be a hazard. Who hasn’t walked into a pole or a fire hydrant while writing a hilarious Facebook post that got thousands of likes? We’ve all done it.
That said, if those N.J. government fat cats down in Trenton think they can make me not text and walk, they’re crazy. I love to text and walk. I was born in New Jersey and I will die in New Jersey — hit by a Ford assembled in the now-demolished Edison plant while texting in the street.
You couldn’t stop me from texting, I’m crazy about it. You know that classic Bruce Springsteen lyric — on “Out In The Street” he sings, “When I’m out in the street/I talk the way I wanna talk.” That was about text messaging on my 4G LTE smartphone.
You see, we have a tradition in New Jersey — walking down the middle of the New Jersey Turnpike, on our phones. We’re all headed over to Bon Jovi’s house for pork roll. Then we all go to the movies for a screening of that classic, On The Waterfront, which was filmed in Hoboken.
It’s because of that classic New Jersey stubbornness that this law is never going to catch on. As we say in New Jersey: “The Sopranos. Newark.”
The issues clearly haven’t slowed interest in the game, though. Ubisoft says the Division set a 24-hour sales record for the company.
If you like waiting on line in real life, you’ll love doing it on your PlayStation. A single design decision has significantly changed the behavior of people playing Tom Clancy’s the Division this week. Ubisoft’s newest video game — an online multiplayer shooter set in New York City — does not allow “pass-through,” or the ability to move through other players if they’re standing in your way. That means that players can block other people from progressing or trap them in certain areas. In life, this is called “being a prick”; in video games, it’s called griefing.
The method for detecting collisions between objects in a video game’s virtual space varies, but usually big multiplayer games like the Division try to make moving around less of a hassle by making sure players can’t block each other’s way. Not so much here: In safe-house areas of the game, players are having to line up in order to speak to one of the non-playable characters.
If a player stands in a doorway, then nobody can pass through said doorway.
And god help you if you get trapped in a corner.
Ubisoft, the game’s developer, has offered a temporary fix for the bug (or, I guess, feature): “If you run into the unfortunate event where other players are blocking your path … Players can force their way past (or through) others by continuously running into said players for ~3 seconds.”
Are you the kind of person who stands strong in the face of Facebook pap and social-media glurge? Your latest challenge is this video from Le Petit Journal, already viral in France and recently subtitled by Jerome Isaac Rousseau. In it, a reporter films a French father talking to his young son about the terror attacks.
“We have to be very careful because we have to change houses,” the kid says, to which his father responds, “Oh, no, don’t worry. We don’t need to move out. France is our home.” It continues:
The kid turns to the reporter and says: “The flowers and the candles are here to protect us.” If you can scroll past it without needing a minute, you are harder-hearted than I am.
The Oasis certainly seems like the best e-reader you can buy. If only you weren’t just one soak away from owning a goofy-looking plastic paperweight.
The Kindle Oasis, the just-announced new model of Amazon’s hugely popular e-reader, carries with it all the superlatives you’d expect from a high-end gadget. It’s the thinnest; it’s the lightest; it has the longest battery life and the brightest display. At 290 bucks, it had better. Sadly, it’s also missing the one upgrade Amazon’s e-readers actually need.
Let’s start with the good, because there’s plenty of it here. There’s that weight, a little less than an iPhone 6S despite being paperback-book-sized. You can go months without recharging the battery, rather than the onerous “several weeks” demanded by previous Kindle e-readers. It has more built-in backlights than previous models, to keep the display from looking splotchy. And it brings back physical buttons, which had gone missing in Kindles these last few years, in favor of touchscreens and slightly off-putting haptic embedded sensors. Yes, buttons are basic. But sometimes basic works.
Then there’s the mileage-may-vary stuff. The Oasis has a great display, but it’s the same one that you’ll find on a Kindle Paperwhite e-reader that costs half the price. Besides which, not to form-factor-shame, but that display is affixed to a mighty weird-looking body. The Oasis comes with a sizeable side-hump, meant for ergonomic grippage. It may ward off wrist ache during marathon Ferrante sessions, but it gives the Oasis a weird tilt when at rest, and also negates that whole “thinnest” thing. Amazon’s new Kindle is astonishingly thin, unless you count the part that’s not.
The Oasis comes with a leather case and battery pack included, which has a three-quarters-book-cover shape that plugs into the grip-hump. Bundling a case with a device isn’t a new twist for Amazon, but making it mandatory is, and precludes you from buying a potentially cheaper, third-party version somewhere down the line. The included case also contributes to that $290 price tag. Which might be worth it to you! Especially if you love physical buttons and hate strict budgeting. (If just the latter applies, splurge on a $200 Kindle Voyage. If neither does, pick up a $120 Paperwhite.)
That pretty well covers what the Oasis is. But it’s equally notable for what it’s not, which is waterproof. This is, objectively speaking, madness — and the reason that, even though I’ve never touched the thing, I know you shouldn’t buy it. E-readers were sent down to Earth to be used at the beach, or by the pool, or in a tub, or while sloshing around a goblet of cheap red wine. They’re as predictable as Chekhov’s gun, except instead of going off, they get splashed, dunked, or drizzled on.
And yet! The Oasis, like all Kindle e-readers before it, remains water-weak. That’s galling not simply because of the cost, which again is your own personal business, but because it’s at this point the only top-tier e-reader not to offer water protection. Kobo, which you’ve likely never heard of, has had a waterproof e-reader since 2014. Even the Nook, which you just now remembered was a thing, went waterproof last fall. You can even pay a company to waterproof a Kindle Paperwhite for you. For some reason, that company’s name isn’t Amazon.
There’s really no excuse for this, especially not at almost $300. It’s not that all of Amazon’s e-readers should be shunned for their lack of waterproofing. But it’s impossible to justify spending that much on a top-of-the-line model that doesn’t actually compete. You can literally buy six full Amazon Fire tablets for less than the price of the Oasis. Even if waterproofing is a feature you’d never think to seek out, it’s a valuable safety net. It’s a kind of insurance for your e-reader, protection from the elements and your own fumblings. And not to lean on schoolyard rhetoric, but everyone else is doing it. Amazon can (and should) too.
Having already gone beyond what the plaintiff was asking for — to the tune of $15 million — the jury in wrestler Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker Media met again on Monday to deliberate additional punitive damages against Gawker, founder Nick Denton, and former editor A.J. Daulerio. The figure: an additional $25 million dollars.
Last week, the same jury awarded a staggering $115 million in strictly compensatory damages. In court earlier today, Judge Pamela Campbell briefed jurors on the net worth of the defendants: Gawker, $83 million; Denton, $121 million; Daulerio, no assets, but $27,000 in student debt.
The jurors decided to award more than $25 million in punitive damages (bringing the total to over $140 million). Of the punitive damages, Gawker owes $15 million, Denton owes $10 million, and Daulerio owes $100,000. One juror, in light of Daulerio’s debt, asked whether they could impose community service in lieu of a financial penalty; the answer was no.
Prior to this afternoon’s verdict, Gawker called into question the jury’s full knowledge of the case. The company said in a statement that “Today’s proceedings are before the same jury that was deprived of the important facts finally disclosed in the newly unsealed documents … The jury also does not know that a state appeals court and a federal judge, on four separate occasions, ruled that the Gawker post was newsworthy.”
At one point, Kanye got an email (maybe regarding this) on his laptop. I know this because the sound of him receiving the email — a brief “ping” — played throughout the arena. Are push notifications the future of the music industry? Kanye makes a strong case for it.
One of the biggest tech things at the event was that Kanye revealed the trailer for his video-game project, Only One. The trailer looked amazing, though it was unclear whether footage was in-engine or pre-rendered, and I’m hoping it’s a triple-A console game rather than one for mobile phones. Kanye said, “I go out and meet with everybody in San Fran, and they’ll diss the fuck out of me.” Why would the tech industry pass up a solid-gold opportunity like this one? I bet angel investors are really kicking themselves in the butt right now. Only One would be a great launch title for the Oculus Rift.
Later in the show, Kanye tried to stream music from Soundcloud, but it cut out. An epic fail for Soundcloud. It’s too early to say what this means for their business prospects, but that’s gotta be rough. Of the incident, Kanye said, “Soundcloud.” Maybe Kanye should save his music locally next time.
Now, Kanye is using Twitter to address the lyrics that he livestreamed around the globe, keeping that #social conversation moving and ensuring that he will continue trending into next week. Congratulations to Kanye on the album launch, and congrats to tech.
Editor’s note: Following staff writer Brian Feldman was allowed to attend Kanye West’s livestream event yesterday on the condition that he find “the tech angle.” As it turns out, there are many tech angles from which apex content generator Kanye West can be considered. For the ease of the on-the-go reader interested chiefly in what Kanye West means to tech, we have bolded the tech angles. For further tech angles, see our recent profile of the gentleman who went viral for tweeting an extremely vulgar story about cucumbers at West. A frantic crowd mobbed Madison Square Garden in New York City on Thursday afternoon to be the first to hear rapper and budding fashion star Kanye West’s latest album The Life of Pablo. It was a widely watched event, streamed worldwide on Tidal, an internet site, to millions — maybe billions — worldwide.
It was a win for Kanye and for fashion, but really, more than anything, this was a win for tech. Tidal, Jay Z’s streaming service, uses the World Wide Web to beam video and audio out to millions of subscribers. Amazing stuff. A concert livestream would not have been possible 30 years ago, and it’s a testament to the tech industry that it happened. What if the Beatles’ rooftop concert had been livestreamed on Tidal? It’s not difficult to “Imagine” that the world would be very different.
But even before the music started, tech was all over Kanye’s event. I bought my ticket online. I didn’t even have to talk to another person. Kanye just tweeted out a link to tickets and I used a web browser to open the link and then I had tickets. Where was the ticket? Get this — it was on my phone. Incredible. We are living in the future. I simply waved my phone in front of a laser and next thing I know I’m listening to Kanye West’s new album. The future!
One thing that was a real problem: long lines for merchandise. Hundreds of people waited in line forever for merch. Is it time to disrupt lines? Maybe Kanye should look into the bevy of e-commerce solutions coming out of Silicon Valley. Or even better, invest in his own.
Kanye played his new album from a laptop computer. That’s tech. That’s the biggest win for tech I’ve seen this year. He could have performed the album, or played it on a vinyl record or wax cylinder, but instead, he did it from a computer chip. How cool is that? All Kanye had to do was plug the 3.5mm headphone jack into his headphone port and he was good to go.
I was able to take a picture of the show using the camera in my iPhone 5s. Just look at all that detail. Remember when people used to carry just-cameras around? Cameras that weren’t even in the phone? I don’t. Many other people in the arena were also using their phones to take pictures and then upload content to social-media services like Snapchat and Instagram. A thin patina of tech covered the gargantuan space.
Other music during the listening party was played from a phone. Yep, it’s true. If you own a smartphone (and have an accompanying data plan or are connected to a Wi-Fi network that is connected to the internet), you can use that phone to play music. It doesn’t even need to be downloaded. You can stream it.
Yesterday, a perfect Reddit storm arrived: a video of a white British YouTuber and his Taiwanese girlfriend being harassed in abusive racial terms by a Taiwanese man on the Taipei subway. The Taiwanese man chews out the YouTuber, Christopher Raymond Hall (YouTube name: Dr34m Lucid), calls his girlfriend a whore, and yells at him to go back to his home country. The white guy defends himself in fairly fluent Chinese before leaving the train.
The video — harassment! bullying! racism! a language-fluency twist! — hit the top of Reddit’s /r/videos section Thursday morning and went hugely viral in Taiwan, racking up more than 1.5 million views. “I’m pretty sure [the bully is] just the Taiwanese version of /r/niceguys” — a subreddit demonstrating that men who think they’re single because they’re too “nice” often aren’t — one commenter says. “It’s much easier to convince yourself that it’s because foreigners ‘steal’ all the women, than consider that maybe you’re just not that attractive,” another adds. “There are xenophobics and assholes in every ethnic groups” [sic].
It gets even better — viral justice has been served. Thanks to the internet-driven attention, the Taiwanese man, whose last name is Liao, was arrested and presented on national television as an embarrassment to his country. (It’s unclear what the charges are.) “Had the video not gone viral no one would have ever cared,” said a Redditor who “lived in Asia for many years as a minority.” Sounds … familiar. According to the Straits Times:
Enjoy this saga — nothing this perfectly Reddit will happen again until someone’s girlfriend cooks him an elaborate meal that they then donate to homeless veterans (PICS INSIDE).
Quartz, The Atlantic–affiliated business-news publication, just launched a clever new iPhone news app, described in its announcement as “an ongoing conversation about the news, sort of like texting.” Its stories, written in conversational, emoji-laden English, are delivered to users like text messages; when you open one up, it’s presented as a speech bubble to which you can respond.
Quartz’s won’t be the last conversational news app or interface we see this year. The BBC’s Trushar Barot has predicted “the botification of news,” mentioning chat bots specifically. The New York Times just released an election bot that integrates with the enterprise chat software Slack; not only does it automatically deliver news and results about the presidential elections to an integrated chat room, but users can ask the bot questions that will be forwarded, it claims, to the Times’ election desk.
News is well suited for bots that can express themselves in natural language (in other words: bots that can write), but in most ways the publishing industry is just following its peers elsewhere in tech: Quartz’s app and the Times’ bot are part of a growing trend in software whose main interface is conversation (or conversational) — software that acts like a personal digital assistant, like Siri, or Microsoft’s Cortana. Instead of knowing exactly which buttons to push and menus to click to get what you want, you can now (or soon) just ask a computer using natural language.
What’s interesting about this, particularly for media, is that software alone isn’t quite up to the task yet (and may never be) — so humans are forced to become a part of the “bot” experience. What you interact with isn’t necessarily a bot or a human, but a mix of both. Customer service was a proving ground for this a few years ago. Have you ever visited a website and immediately encountered a customer service pop-up asking if you need help? The odds are pretty good that if you use it, you’ll start the conversation with a bot and, somewhere within the process, quietly transition to a human operator.
Sometimes, this is happening along vectors that you don’t even notice. Bots are responsible for churning out automated articles on data-heavy topics — things like corporate earnings and … earthquakes. But for more, well, human topics, the question of how information is presented to users is less certain. Facebook’s Trending Topics are the best example of this — the process of exactly who (or what) curates them is unclear, and what results is a stilted mash of automated input and extraction and creative human knowledge.
On the flip side of Facebook’s detached list is Quartz’s new app. Its tone is resolutely, almost aggressively human (it’s written by a team of editors), but there are simulated touches that drive it into the uncanny valley. In particular, the app, though it doesn’t need to, simulates the three-dot speech bubble that signifies someone is typing. The iconography is key here. When a smartphone (or at least an iPhone in this case) is transferring data, the standard indicator is that small spinning wheel in the status bar at the top of the screen. The three-dot bubble is different. It indicates, very clearly, another human is typing at the keyboard. This isn’t, on one hand, entirely wrong — a human did write what will soon arrive on your screen — but it’s also not right: No one is typing on the other end. Compellingly, eerily, and in a way that I would not be surprised to see catch on, Quartz is equating downloading data with actual human interaction.
It’s still fairly easy to tell when you’re talking to a computer (spinning wheel), or a human (floating dots). But it’s getting harder not simply because humans are increasingly reliant on algorithmic input, or because software is getting better at mimicking human behavior, but because the things we interact with tend to involve both human and bot input at multiple levels of operation. We have humans mimicking the cold, to-the-point news presentation of algorithms like Facebook’s, and bots mimicking the folksy, “brands saying ‘bae’” tone of our modern media economy. What comes out the other end is less a bot that sounds like a human, or a human that sounds like a bot, than an uncanny hybrid.
2. Type "Who did this?" Or "who did this" or "fam who did this?"
3. Paste in 😂 It’s in "Smileys & People" on your iPhone.
Generally speaking 😂 is used to communicate laughter, but of a specific kind: involuntary and forceful. It covers three separate emotional reactions — crying, laughing, and cry-laughing — as well as the nebulous middle ground between each. Maybe something is so funny that you cry from laughing so hard, maybe something is so uncomfortable that you can’t help but laugh while you cry. In other words, it’s better suited for the immediate and sometimes risqué humor of social media than it is for parlor-room wit.
Its versatility, and its usefulness for the kind of humor made for social media, makes 😂 the most-used symbol on Twitter, ahead of the second-place heart by nearly 2:1 according to emojitracker. It’s not uncommon to find it used in tandem with the phrase “who did this,” a nod to the unknown origins of many of the viral images floating around social media.
Crying face is generally used more widely than its similar cousin 😭, or “loudly crying face,” which can mean the same thing but possibly appears too pained to really travel. Why did human crying face win out over, say, its cat equivalent, 😹? Cat face with tears of joy, ranks 120th on emojitracker. I can’t say for certain why emoji users prefer one over the other, but I believe part of the disparity stems from the fact that many emoji users are human, rather than cat.
Yesterday, Oxford Dictionaries announced that its Word of the Year of 2015 is 😂, otherwise designated as “Face with Tears of Joy” by the Unicode Consortium. Who did this, fam?
In the announcement, Oxford University Press said that they had partnered with keyboard developer SwiftKey to analyze usage worldwide. “😂 made up 20% of all the emojis used in the UK in 2015, and 17% of those in the US: a sharp rise from 4% and 9% respectively in 2014,” they wrote. (The source of this data is unclear, but is likely drawn in large part from the typing habits SwiftKey keyboard users as well as publicly accessible publishing platforms like Twitter. Collecting reliable stats from Facebook has been notoriously difficult for years, owing to user inclination not to make everything they post on Facebook public. Let’s say that our anecdotal experience doesn’t contradict the data.)
(While we’re in parentheticals, let’s make it clear that Oxford Dictionaries is not the Oxford English Dictionary: “The dictionary content in Oxford Dictionaries focuses on current English and includes modern meanings and uses of words … The OED, on the other hand, is a historical dictionary[.]”)
We’ll sidestep the no-doubt scintillating debate over whether or not 😂 is actually a word and acknowledge that 😂 is unquestionably among the top emoji, as any frequent user of Instagram, Twitter, or Vine will tell you.
How do you use the crymoji? There are three steps:
1. Find a humorous picture, video, or news story. Something immediately and viscerally funny or weird, and probably just on the edge of offensive.
If Jeb Bush’s answer was Baby Hitler meme’s triumph, it was also the start of its downfall. Already, the childhood innocence of the Baby Hitler meme was starting to erode. Close observers could see what Baby Hitler meme might one day grow into.
And so, PFT Commenter decided, “Hell yeah! You gotta step up,” and put the meme out of its misery.
~’~,~{@
R.I.P. Baby Hitler media meme
October 23, 2015 – November 10, 2015
@}~,~’~
Yesterday, on November 10, 2015 A.D., Ben Carson and the noted football commentator PFT Commenter did the unthinkable: They killed the Baby Hitler meme.
Asked if he would abort Baby Hitler, Carson said that he would not. Within his mother’s womb, Baby Hitler would be safe.
In asking and answering the question, Mr. Commenter and Mr. Carson killed a meme in its infancy, before it had time to grow and spread hate and prejudice across the hemispheres. The media meme involving Baby Hitler was dead.
Baby Hitler meme was born on October 23, 2015, at 2:04 p.m., when the august New York Times Magazine asked: “If you could go back and kill Hitler as a baby, would you do it?”
In almost no time, Baby Hitler meme grew and traveled wide. Vox, The Atlantic, and the Washington Post all wrote articles based on the premise of the Baby Hitler meme. It reached full maturity on Monday when presidential candidate Jeb Bush was asked if he would kill baby Hitler: “Hell yeah, I would,” Mr. Bush replied. “You gotta step up, man.”
These remarks come hot on the heels of an aggressive filing from the Justice Department last Thursday, where the Justice Department suggested Apple is already doing this sort of thing for the Chinese government and that the tech company is using this case as a “marketing tool” because it knows it’ll get press — claims Apple has vehemently denied in its newest brief.
After weeks of relentlessly negging each other in their legal filings and the press, Apple and the FBI are getting in their final punches before heading to court next week.
The two have been locked in a very public feud about phones that were confiscated during the investigation for the San Bernardino shooting, with Apple opposing a court order that would force the company to help unlock the phones for governmental investigation purposes. On one side, the FBI is asking Apple to create a new software tool that would help it break into customers’ encrypted data during investigations. On the other, Apple is like, “Hm, seems like something we shouldn’t have to provide you with, specifically because it sounds very evil.”
Just like a son home for Thanksgiving who knows setting up the printer will soon turn into a half-day lesson in migrating mom’s entire camera roll to her laptop, Apple believes that if it assists the FBI, a precedent will be set in which it — and other tech companies — are obligated to build all kinds of free, sinister crap for the government.
Also: Shouldn’t government agencies be able to build this on their own? Because they’re smart? And good at their jobs?
That’s where Apple’s latest legal own comes into play. In the company’s most recent brief (the last one to be filed before they meet in court next week), it asks a pretty straightforward question: Why isn’t the NSA, the government agency that exists specifically to address things like this, taking care of the FBI’s software needs?
It’s an issue that has already been brought up in the press by a former national security official, but this is the first time the company has specifically addressed the question in these proceedings.
From the brief: “The government does not deny that there may be other agencies in the government that could assist it in unlocking the phone and accessing its data; rather, it claims, without support, that it has no obligation to consult other agencies … Defining the scope of the All Writs Act as inversely proportional to the capabilities of the FBI removes any incentive for it to innovate and develop more robust forensic capabilities.”
Or, more simply: Y’all are lazy. Do it yourselves.
“Some stories on Yahoo, including this story by .MIC, are selected and published by an algorithm. The story was immediately removed after the error was flagged,” a Yahoo spokesperson said.
Last week brought the first teaser for Rihanna’s upcoming album Anti, her first full-length record in nearly three years. It also brought the first “review” of Anti, which was especially strange because the record hasn’t leaked and doesn’t even have an official release date. But that didn’t stop a twitchy computer algorithm at Yahoo from releasing this incomplete Mic piece about Anti last Friday, riddled with blanks yet to be filled in.
It’s not shocking that a new-media outlet would prepare a skeleton of a draft in advance of a major new pop album — print publications have done similar things for obituaries and expected news stories for decades. What’s interesting (and funny) about Mic’s review is that the pressure here isn’t about print deadlines — it’s about Google. Very soon, a number of people are going to be searching “Rihanna Anti download,” “Rihanna Anti lyrics,” and “Rihanna Anti streaming.” Mic knows this, as evidenced by its cynical, SEO-friendly headline, and it would like to scoop up as many of those wandering Googlers as possible. Those people, and (perhaps more important) Google’s algorithms, will be hungry for data about [LYRICS] and [FEATURED ARTISTS], and will probably appreciate a helpful [HYPERLINK TO RAPGENIUS]. This is clear.
It’s embarrassing to see the current media dogfight over scraps of internet traffic laid bare in this way, but not as embarrassing as the blanks to be filled in about Anti’s lyrical content. Although no one’s heard the record, Mic is betting we’ll see an “edgier, freer” Rihanna — probably a safe assumption after the video for “Bitch Better Have My Money,” and of course, the unforgettable line [LYRICS] from [TRACK NAME].
Chris Riotta, the Mic staff writer whose byline appeared on the piece, realized his Mad-Libs-style prewrite could look a little strange to anyone who’s not familiar with the race to cover breaking news for the valuable unique visitors of the internet, and wanted to make clear that this was not a review:
In this case, it’s the machines, not the humans they will inevitably replace, that are to blame:
Several U.S. cities and states are currently considering laws to regulate the small, personal-use quadcopters we’ve all agreed to call “drones,” but once those laws are in place, how do you stop drone pilots who violate them? The Dutch National Police are way ahead of us on that one: They’ve been training eagles to take down unruly drones.
A video hit YouTube Monday showing an eagle trained by Dutch police and the Hague-based raptor-training firm Guard From Above as it snatches a drone from midair without suffering any damage from its spinning props.
At the IEEE’s Spectrum blog, Evan Ackerman raised some concerns Monday about the safety risks of using birds as anti-drone weapons, especially in the U.S., where some eagle species are legally protected.
Guard From Above has an answer to the question of bird safety, although it’s not exactly reassuring: In nature, birds of prey often overpower large and dangerous prey. Their talons have scales, which protect them, naturally, from their victims’ bites. Of course, we are continuously investigating any extra possible protective measures we can take in order to protect our birds.
The Dutch National Police have also commissioned a study to make sure that drone-snatching won’t damage the birds’ claws. Meanwhile, in the U.S., a Kentucky judge ruled in what’s being called the “drone-slayer” case that a man was within his rights to shoot down a hobby drone that had hovered over his property multiple times. The drone-slayer, William Merideth, used a 12-gauge shotgun loaded with buckshot to remove the offending drone. His neighbor, the drone pilot, is currently suing in federal court, asking a judge to determine whether flying a drone over private property qualifies as trespassing.
But what’s so addictive about a video of a teen clowning his friend? Why did “Daaaamn, Daniel?” make Josh an instant Twitter icon? The repetition and distinctive tone are part of it, for sure. It plays over and over in your head and practically begs you to say it out loud.
Josh’s commitment to the bit is part of it, too: He clearly daaaamned Daniel over a period of several days, even weeks. It feels like an inside joke among a group of friends, and now we’re all inside it.
Even “back at it again” feels optimized for catchiness. It’s the same way that one of the most iconic Vines of all time — ”Back at it again at Krispy Kreme” — starts.
The more familiar something becomes to us, the more times it is repeated, and the more we daaaaamn, Daniel.
Unfortunately, this very good and captivating meme is already dying. Whoever runs the Twitter account for Vans, not wanting to suffer the same sad fate as Red Lobster’s social-media team after Beyoncé dropped “Formation,” has already co-opted “Damn, Daniel” for marketing purposes.
Braaaaands, Daniel!
Numerous studies have suggested that the more we hear something repeated, the more we begin to like it. This applies to pop songs, and it probably applies to Vines and short videos on Twitter, too. A high-school kid squawking “Daaaamn, Daniel!” at his friend is kind of funny the first time, but by the tenth time it’s legitimately laugh-out-loud good. “Daaaamn, Daniel! Back at it again with the white Vans!”
In the few days since he posted it, Josholzz’s masterpiece has absolutely captivated the internet. It’s been shared hundreds of thousands of times. And now there are fire remixes on SoundCloud:
There are parodies:
And there are people who just cannot stop thinking about it:
Keep freezin’ those pants, gang!
As freezing temperatures move across the Midwest, it’s finally Frozen Pants season. Frozen Pants! Surely you know what those are. Okay, imagine pants. Good, okay now visualize them … frozen and standing up. The pants look as they do when worn by a person, but here’s the twist: Nobody’s wearing them. What if pants were worn by a ghost? That’s what frozen pants are.
Minneapolis’s Star Tribune traces the Frozen Pants phenomenon sweeping (a small section of) the nation to 61-year-old Tom Grotting. He soaks the pants in water and then poses them on his lawn. This year, he challenged the “I Love NE Minneapolis” Facebook group (closed but 11,000 members strong) to make their own frozen pants. Grotting’s neighbor called it “the only funny thing about this weather.”
And it is funny! Look at these peopleless pants!
Among my personal internet co-conversationalists, in fact, ded has taken on some of the tone of the sarcastic LOL, a dry, world-weary utterance meaning that the mundane stupidity of the internet is slowly killing you, not that you died laughing. It’s very useful. As in, “this Times trend piece about internet vocabulary makes me ded.” LOL.
I’m literally dying at the way Jessica Bennett’s recent piece in the New York Times about hyperbole online nails a particular trend. We’ve become so inured to most text dialogue that we have to exaggerate everything to get even a hint of actual emotion across (just ask any headline writer forced to describe a moderately funny zing as a “perfect response” to a “hilarious tweet”). Our standards have gradually risen, or else we’re simply more immune to sentiment. If you’re replying “ha-ha” to a friend, you might as well not respond at all. You possibly “can’t even,” but if you can, you have to be “SCREAMING,” or, in a highly non-literal way, “literally dying” — a phrase which, Bennett’s young assistant tells her, “has become, like, the new LOL.”
So where does that leave poor LOL? As internet language detaches itself from any relationship to off-keyboard action, it’s become less and less useful to tell people what you’re doing with your body. “Laughing out loud” is already generally understood to be metaphorical rather than literal — hence the need to write “actually LOLing” when you are. And what a paltry metaphor “laughing out loud” is compared to “literally dying”! But this doesn’t mean the internet will stop using LOL. Instead, LOL has ascended to the firmament, an all-meaning, all-useful fixture of internet speak. LOL is dead; long live LOL.
LOL’s meaning was once mundane, functional. It was coined in the late ‘80s as a means of expressing what couldn’t be communicated in an early chat room — the moment when something online made you laugh so hard IRL that it became embarrassing, at least in a context where most people didn’t understand that being on a computer on the internet could possibly be funny.
The term was initially derided, but it evolved into a useful shorthand as chatting online became a mainstream experience in the 1990s — the first of many cycles of ironic and sincere use that the term would undergo over the next two decades. As it became so commonplace as to lose its literal meaning, LOL fractured into various iterations: LMAO — “laughing my ass off” — was one alternative, now experiencing a sarcastic renaissance on Twitter; “Ha.” was the go-to for knowing laughter, schadenfreude, or simple acknowledgement that a joke had been made; ROFL presented another less-than-subtle option, but the ROFLcopter GIF was only ever deployed in a joke on someone else’s expense (see also the infamous and highly inappropriate lollercaust). And, as The New Yorker points out, “hahaha” is alive and well in a relatively sincere form.
But as these cousins and descendants have fallen in and out of popularity, LOL, the web’s Ur-laugh, remains. LOL can mean whatever you want: an actual, genuine laugh; a sarcastic, derisive snort; an acknowledgement of another person’s presence. In many cases its basic purpose isn’t to mean a specific thing at all — it’s to communicate a shared understanding of a conversation. As a placeholder and suffix it can “signal basic empathy between texters,” as linguist John McWhorter has argued; it tells your interlocutors “we’re speaking the same language.”
Above all, LOL today is the nervous laughter of being online — the giggle that comes from the strangeness of media this new, where we never really know where we stand. The challenge of constant, always-available communication undertaken without the important signaling done by our faces or tones of voice produces an anxiety voiced by LOL — at once referring to the physical act of laughing and distancing itself from it.
In some ways, “literally dead” accomplishes the same thing. We are not dead, nor literally much of anything when online, but we’re still using these phrases in an attempt to break through the internet’s depersonalizing communication barriers.
In Bennett’s article, she ascribes the usage of “ded” to typing so quickly you can’t even be bothered to include the a in dead. But I think we’re all better typists than that. Each excluded letter, mistaken spelling, and smashed key of internet slang is an intentional building block of ever-changing meaning — and of further distancing our online cultural signals from those we make use of offline. Evolving to its medium, our internet language is ever more abstract, non-literal, and subtle, especially when used to critique itself.
Almost five years after Apple brought voice control into the mainstream with Siri, the company is making plans to bring the feature to its desktop operating system, Mac OS X.
According to 9to5Mac, the 10.12 release of OS X will include Siri as a feature of the menu bar at the top of the screen, similar to the universal search Spotlight mechanic that sits there now. And like Spotlight, it will include a keyboard shortcut for easy activation. According to the site’s sources, “When a user clicks the Siri button, a dark, transparent Siri interface will appear in the top right corner of the screen,” though the interface could change before its expected unveiling this summer.
It’s the latest move in an accelerating shift toward natural-language interfaces — that is, modes of using your computer that involve “talking” to it instead of using a mouse or your finger to point and click. As computers have become essential not just to work but to day-to-day life, and as they have gotten smaller and ever-present, the largest technology companies are all attempting to make them more natural to work with.
Siri, despite being the first to popularize talking to a computer as if it were a person, has been slow to make its way from iOS to OS X. In the four or so years since its introduction, the “OK Google” feature has been worked into Chromebooks, and Microsoft’s competitor, Cortana, similarly made its debut in Windows 10 last fall.
An ancient Greek sculpture crafted in 100 B.C. has finally fulfilled the purpose for which it was created: going viral on Facebook. The trending topic for the statue, “Ancient Greek Sculpture: Artwork Depicts What Some Say Is a Laptop Computer, Report Says,” is filled with tons of posts about the viral sculpture. Reports are saying that some are saying that it’s a laptop, and who am I to question that?
Grave Naiskos of an Enthroned Woman With an Attendant features a small child presenting something to a woman. Is it a laptop? The answer is “yes.” One hundred percent, absolutely “yes.” This is a laptop. The question: Are the USB ports on the side the new, versatile, future-proof USB-C, or are they the more limited USB 3.1 ports?
Or perhaps they’re proprietary Lightning ports? “Maybe it’s just a shallow box or something,” you say, like an imbecile. Wrong! It’s a laptop computer, which proves that time travel existed. How else would this arcane sculpture featuring a laptop computer — with genuine USB (HDMI, maybe?) ports on the side — have come into being?
Historians are unsure of what type of laptop is being held by the child, though, given the relative size, it’s probably a netbook or something in that range — definitely not a prosumer model. The USB port could have been used for a wide range of accessories, from ancient Greek trackpads to flash drives. The screen, according to my analysis, is 163 pixels per inch.
One thing is for sure, though: That’s a laptop in the ancient Greek statue. That’s indisputable.
Again, like the aux cord, this was, by most standard definitions, an actual meme. But, again, it should have been way bigger. I mean, look at this picture of John Lennon walking funny! There are a few things going on here. For one, John Lennon looks like a real tosspot, and two, it’s a riff on Absolute Madman lad culture.
This image has been floating around for a while (this Photoshop thread on Reddit hails from mid-2014), but John Lennon, the Absolute Madman, has never reached the upper echelon. At least not yet. He came close in 2015 thanks to 4chan’s /mu/ board, but there’s still a ways to go.
Specifically, This Minions Tattoo
Minions were everywhere in 2015, but I think this tattoo deserves special mention for marrying the Yellow Blight with the web’s generally saccharine, auto-win nostalgia for Calvin and Hobbes/the ‘90s.
The Beatboxing Part From Korn’s “Freak on a Leash”
The spread of viral content operated at an unceasing and increasing pace in 2015. According to preliminary figures from various NGOs, the world saw at least one meme born every day this year. The Dress went from a dress in all lowercase to a Dress in title case in a matter of hours, not days. There was no point in 2015 during which something was not viral. There is a finite capacity for viral attention, and we filled every second of this year with some new meme or goof. But for every Dress there was its dark shadow — other pieces of content that fumbled before achieving max virality, or that had unfulfilled viral potential. Maybe 2016 will be their year. This is what should have been more viral in 2015.
This was the hottest jam of 2015. A veritable Song of Summer — and Winter and Spring and Fall — but we missed it. It has long been posited that audio doesn’t go viral, and this is mostly true. In 2015, however, Vine’s continuing cultural ascendancy and easier tools for incorporating audio have made it easy to riff on the hottest tracks. One need only look at the glut of “Hello” memes to get the picture.
This Tweet From The View
Only 63 likes! That’s crazy. I kind of expected this to be the most liked tweet on Earth? Certainly in the tristate area.
This Shrek Headstone
Shrek is love, Shrek is life, Shrek is … death? Whichever 2016 candidate announces a platform that includes a mandatory Shrek headstone is the one who will get my vote.
MyIdol
MyIdol was (is?) an incredible app that peaked before it was ready. Made in China, it allows users to scan their face, pick an outfit, and use the resulting avatar in any number of uncanny-valley dance numbers.
The Aux Cord
The only problem was that when MyIdol first gained attention, in my corner of the web, it did not have an English translation, so it was a lot of tapping around unreadable labels until something worked. By the time MyIdol got around to releasing an English translation, the moment had passed. But for a solid week, MyIdol was the talk of the town, and they can never take away those memories.
This Goodfellas Tattoo Ray Liotta Saw at Chipotle
Put this tattoo in the Louvre.
Okay, let’s get this out of the way: The aux cord was more viral than ever this year. It was very viral, and at the same time, it could have been way more viral. It should have been way more viral.
The idea is simple: Nobody listens to radio anymore, and everyone uses their mobile device to listen to music. The simplest way to do this is by connecting your device to your audio setup via an auxiliary cord (“aux cord” for short), which features a male 3.5-millimeter jack on each end. So, for instance, when your friend wants to put on some killer Avicii tracks, you hand them the aux cord. In other words, it was a way of making fun of that annoying friend at a party who always wants to put on their own music.
Let’s meme more audio equipment in 2016.
John Lennon Walking Funny
Anyway, the future of content is fast approaching. Some might say it’s already here. Despite this being Tiger Beat’s first issue dedicated to social media, it’s already ready to anoint a new class of web stars. YouTube: The Next Generation includes Brent Rivera (pet peeve: “teachers not erasing every mark on whiteboards”), Meredith Foster (favorite emoji: 😎), Amanda Steele (nickname: Mandy), Christian Collins (knows how to code), and Sierra Furtado (pull quote: “I guess I’m famous. I don’t know … I just make videos and do things”).
Fascinatingly enough, most of the social-media stars view the platforms where they’ve gotten their starts as launchpads … straight into old media. Most have aspirations of signing a record deal or acting in TV and film. For all of the talk of new media’s ascendancy, and its disruption of the old-media stranglehold, it’s clear that for its stars, YouTube is considered a means, not an end.
The next section, “2015 by the Numbers,” is all about recapping the year in social media. Maybe you’ll enjoy the biggest celebrity Twitter fights of the year. Or maybe:
“It’s disgusting.”
Maybe you remember Meme Mania. Memes are finally cool in 2015, and these were the biggest ones.
(Despite having its finger on the pulse, Tiger Beat doesn’t get everything right. This graphic claims that “What are those!?” is past its prime. That’s impossible. “What are those!?” is a transcendent meme. It’s timeless. So long as people wear bad shoes, brave men and women will stand up and ask: “What are thooooooose!?”)
Lastly, there’s an activity section. This is where teen girls (and, uh, me) find out whether we’re “selfie crazy,” and which emoji describes our destiny. Here’s what I learned: I am not selfie crazy, I am “camera shy.” (True.) I am bad at matching tweets to tweeter. (Two out of ten.) My texting style is “emoji crazy!” (Unsure about this one.) My shade style is cat-eye sunglasses. The 👯 emoji best describes my destiny. This is my call to fame:
Teen heartthrob magazine Tiger Beat’s very first social-media issue hit stands today. “You crammed our feeds with requests for an entire issue devoted to social media stars, so here you go!” is how the front-of-the-book note from editor-in-chief Leesa Coble puts it. What follows is 90 full-color pages of young, fresh-faced, tech-savvy (and mostly white) digital natives.
Way ahead of you, Tiger Beat!
As an ancient, 24-year-old millennial, I picked up a copy, hoping to gather some secrets so that I wouldn’t get Logan’s Run’d off of Vine next year. What follows is what I learned.
Look at all these fun facts!
One section of the magazine is How-To’s. How to be a Vine star, how to build a YouTube channel, etc. Nearly every single piece of advice falls into one of two categories: very specific media-oriented tactics, or upbeat teen platitudes.
Most important on the platitude side is to “BE YOURSELF!” When it comes to YouTube, “This is the hardest part, you just need to start!” As one YouTuber says, “I don’t write scripts, I just sit down in front of my camera and talk about stuff!”
Of course, while being yourself, you need to also make sure that you come up with a content schedule, jump on trending topics, and focus test content to make sure it has viral potential. (Nothing says Tiger Beat teen hunk like “content schedule.”) The advice sounds, frankly, like the SEO and social seminars nearly every major publication media publication puts on for its staff; for people like me more familiar with the media landscape of five or ten years ago, the strategies of “form brand sponsorships” and “just wing it” seem diametrically opposed. But this may be why I am not a YouTube star!
This might have been the most fascinating aspect of the issue to me — someone who is aware of teen social-media celebrity without being an active consumer of it. Its subjects are surprisingly frank about the Capital-B Business of being an online star and, at the same time, you know: adolescent.
These nuances were lost, perhaps willfully, on a group of Gamergaters and their allies, who quickly used the thesis and various old tweets of Rapp’s to launch a campaign to tar her as a defender of child pornography — a campaign that extended to lovely corners of the internet like The Daily Stormer. The anti-Rapp crusaders were helped along when Jamie Walton, who runs an anti-sex-trafficking organization she co-founded with the filmmaker Kevin Smith, decided to ask via Twitter why Rapp hadn’t been fired (Walton has also beefed with another famous Gamergate target, the game developer Brianna Wu). Walton’s involvement seemed to accelerate the online campaign against Rapp — even as some gaters, it should be said, questioned the ethics of the campaign on KotakuInAction, Gamergate’s Reddit redoubt.
Now the crusaders appear to have gotten their wish. We’ve reached out to Nintendo for a statement about the reason for Rapp’s dismissal and will update this post if the company responds. But it certainly looks like she lost her job because she wrote a college thesis well within the bounds of the subjects discussed in college theses.
If so, that’s an inspiring victory for Gamergate, a movement dedicated to standing up for the little guy and protecting people’s rights to free expression.
Update, 3/31: Last night, Nintendo released a statement denying Rapp’s firing had anything to do with the campaign against her:
In the initial tweets that broke this story, Rapp never mentioned having been fired for a reason that, on paper, isn’t directly connected to the harassment campaign against her. After Nintendo’s response was published in various outlets, she acknowledged, via tweets and an interview with Game Informer, that she had moonlighted to pay off student-loan bills, and had done so under an alias. It was only because of the campaign against her, she argued to Game Informer, that Nintendo found out about her second job via a tip from someone “external to the company.” She tweeted this argument last night as well: “The amount of obsession it must take to dig up old tweets, find addresses, link me to anon things not related to games is NOT. NORMAL.”
We’ve reached out to Nintendo for further clarification about Rapp’s firing and will update this post if the company provides any new information.
Correction: This post originally stated that Jamie Walton is the wife of Kevin Smith. She isn’t — Smith co-founded The Wayne Foundation with her. The text has been updated to reflect this.
For many people, Gamergate isn’t really a thing anymore. For the most part, it has receded from the headlines — we’re more than a year past the period of peak thinkpiecery on Gamergate, online harassment, and how the two intersect. But that doesn’t mean some of the group’s more enterprising members have stopped rabidly going after anyone they think is promoting an SJW (social-justice warrior) narrative or messing with their previous vidya.
For a particularly gross example, look no further than a piece of news that just dropped (part of a Twitter thread that starts here):
To understand why this matters requires just a little backstory about who the author of that tweet, Alison Rapp, is, and what was done to her. [Update: Read Nintendo’s response at the bottom of this post.]
In recent months, some gamers have gotten increasingly outraged at how Japan-originating games are “localized” when they are brought to the U.S. Due to cultural differences between the two countries, sometimes sexualized content is toned down, for example. For a subset of gamers, many of them in Gamergate and many of them in need of other hobbies, this is an astonishing outrage that represents everything wrong with the world and the SJWs who run it.
Over the last few months, many of these gamers have turned their ire on Rapp, a young marketing employee at Nintendo who, as Patrick Klepek wrote in a comprehensive and well-reported article in Kotaku, “has been accused of somehow being a driving force behind the supposed censorship of that company’s games.” Rapp, it should be said, doesn’t even have anything to do with localization at Nintendo; she’s been targeted simply for having been “outspoken on Twitter about online abuse against women in gaming,” as Klepek put it. In the course of digging as deeply into her past as possible to find ways to discredit her, some gamers found an undergraduate thesis she wrote in 2011, and it seriously exacerbated the campaign against her.
In her thesis, Rapp laid out a highly academic case for why the U.S. shouldn’t pressure Japan, where the sexualization of young teens has long been entrenched in certain corners of the culture, to adopt child-pornography laws similar to our own. It reads like pretty standard-issue undergraduate cultural relativism. Anyone familiar with these arguments — even those inclined to think it’s fair to judge someone based on academic papers they wrote in college — would know that Rapp wasn’t condoning child pornography, but rather making a more nuanced argument about American cultural imperialism and so forth (she also argued that child pornography doesn’t cause people to abuse children).
“At the time I received that message I was hesitant to decide whether it was a very unlikely coincidence, or if someone was boldly letting me know that they were privy to my true identity. So, I decided to include it in my post as a way of publicly stating that I had read their email, and that the underlying message came across loud and clear,” she wrote.
Bloggers and security researchers carefully compiled the evidence that Samantha was really Victor over a period of days, pointing to matching email headers and website footers, and matching IP addresses. Then there was Victor’s online history, which was years longer than Samantha’s and included past accusations of deceit.
It seemed everyone suspected Samantha was Victor. But no one suggested Victor might also be Samantha.
For some, the revelation changes everything:
For others, nothing at all:
Writer Samantha Bielefeld has been at the center of a controversy over the past couple of weeks after high-profile Apple bloggers accused her of being a man named Victor Johnson, publishing an inflammatory blog under a false female identity. On Thursday, Bielefeld told her side of the story, and it’s both more complicated and more straightforward than anyone suspected.
Bielefeld continues to offer refunds to her remaining paid subscribers, and ended her post with the hope that it would bring “some sort of closure, whatever that may mean for different people.”
“My birth certificate says Victor Wynne Johnson on it,” Bielefeld wrote on her blog, in a post titled “Straight From the Horse’s Mouth,” “but my heart says another, that name being Samantha.”
She went on to explain that she’s transgender, but had feared being shunned if she came out publicly. Instead, she began writing as Samantha, whose blog represented “an outlet where I could begin to experience life how I truly wanted.”
“[M]y fantasy led to repeatedly lying to decent, well-meaning people who took my words at face value,” she admitted.
And while Samantha apologized for “misrepresenting” herself, and for some of the “inappropriate” things she’s said on Twitter — presumably including posting prominent Apple blogger John Gruber’s partial phone number — she stood by all of her controversial articles, a number of which picked fights with well-known bloggers and developers.
While confessing she’s deceived the community that reads her — and in some cases, pays for subscriptions to her blog — Bielefeld also denied certain parts of the popular narrative surrounding her.
She wrote that she took her last name, Bielefeld, not from an internet conspiracy theory about a made-up city, but from a teacher she had growing up. She even linked to his Twitter account.
Bielefeld also denies one of the most troubling accusations against her: that she faked an ugly, harassing email to herself to elicit sympathy. The message she posted on her website, which suggested she kill herself, was signed “Victor Johnson.”
After:
As you can see, Shkreli has embraced his newfound infamy. His profile now assumes potential mates will recognize him as a small Lex Luthor with better hair — or, as he puts it, “that guy.” He no longer discusses his aspirations of building a life with someone, or boasts about being funny and intelligent.
And, of course, there’s his new specialization in “eye rolling.” If he added that to his résumé after the congressional hearing, it’s the latest in a long line of bratty troll moves that seem calculated to make Shkreli appear like a cartoon bad guy — including threatening to remove Ghostface Killah from the one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album he won at auction.
It would almost be funny, and maybe even worth going on a date with him for the novelty, if he hadn’t jacked up the price of a life-saving drug used by AIDS patients.
On Thursday, pharmaceutical executive and supervillain Martin Shkreli testified before Congress using only obnoxious facial expressions and invocations of the Fifth Amendment. Friday morning, he had apparently updated his OKCupid profile to include “eye rolls” on the list of things he’s really good at.
It’s not news that Shkreli, arguably the most-hated man in America today, uses online-dating services. In September, writer Eve Peyser matched with Shkreli on Tinder not long after she had written an article mocking his OKCupid profile.
This morning, BuzzFeed creative director Alix McAlpine noticed that Shkreli’s still on OKCupid months later, as his popularity is arguably at an all-time low and his punchability is definitely at an all-time high.
“Not today, Satan,” she tweeted.
Let’s take a quick look at how Shkreli — who once claimed he received “50-100 date solicitations a day” — has changed his approach to dating as his bad reputation has grown.
Before:
“Man, he was dropping major keys,” says one. Keys, which Khaled heralds with the use of the key emoji, are advice or wisdom. These include, for instance, “When you get out the shower, dry your back — it’s a cold world out there.” (There’s an entire sub-Reddit devoted to Khaled’s keys.) Other building blocks of the Khaled Snap lexicon include “Bless up,” which is sort of like “What’s up” but also “I wish you well,” and usually indicated by the prayer-hand emoji. He’s also fond of #AnotherOne, deployed when he’s replicating a success. Then there are the admonitions, like “Protect the Bag,” as in money.
This being the internet of 2016, publications like Forbes and Tech Insider have recently used Khaled as a case study, mining his social-media success for branding strategies. Uber and MasterCard have started piggy­backing on his use of “Major [Key Emoji]” to seem relevant. The Khaled effect is quantifiable: Usage of the key emoji increased by 800 percent one month after he started using it.
One of Khaled’s employees interrupts us because it’s “snack time.” He’s pulled a Tupperware labeled SNACK 1 out of the hotel room’s mini-fridge — an apple with almond butter. He places it on the table in front of Khaled — a man of girth — who’s often Snapping while sweating profusely from the elliptical. “I want to lose weight because I want to be focused, meaning healthy,” he says. “That’s me inspiring myself. That’s a secret they hid from me growing up. They never told me about gluten-free.”
They is a commonly referred-to force in Khaled’s life. It’s they who don’t want you to win in any way at all. They don’t want you to have a nice breakfast. “Khaled, who is they?”
He looks up from his phone. “They is … stay away from them, please. There is so many different definitions of they. You might have a personal they. They against you; they want you broken and miserable. They don’t like winners, they don’t like people who’s blessed. So everybody’s got a different they.” Having finished his sermon, he returns to his notifications, rolling in ceaselessly.
*This article appears in the February 22, 2016 issue of New York Magazine.
I hear it before I even poke my head through the door frame: the familiar, percussive, triumphant declaration of self that I’ve heard at the beginning of several popular radio-friendly rap songs in the past decade, like “All I Do Is Win” and “We Takin’ Over.” The trademark “DJ Khaaaled” incantation is sort of what the rap personality and producer DJ Khaled is best known for — or at least it was until he joined Snapchat four months ago. It’s the equivalent of blowing an air horn at the beginning of a game or, in this case, at the start of a video, like the teaser he’s filming with Nas in a blunty-smelling bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
DJ Khaled — real name: Khaled Khaled, and perhaps the most famous living Palestinian-American besides former governor John Sununu and the Hadid brood — is leaning back in an armchair, wearing a big chain and low-slung dark-wash jeans, with a We the Best hoodie from his new line of Khaled merchandise. He and Nas have just finished up an hourslong recording session for the second episode of We the Best Radio, Khaled’s show for Apple Music’s Beats 1 radio. Khaled has big plans for his show. Diddy, for instance, will be interviewed in a Jacuzzi, Rick Ross in a Rolls-Royce. (It’s audio, but Khaled believes the setting matters.) Since Nas is one of Khaled’s idols, though, he wanted full “Oprah vibes.” Hence the semi-formal couch interview and all the signifiers of the good life: crystal glasses of Henny, a fat cigar smoking in the ashtray, and some fresh purple flowers — his “angels,” as Khaled calls blooms on the regular Snapchat tours he gives of his garden.
In an unlikely turn of events, the 40-year-old Khaled — who has been steadily making music since the early ’90s, recently collaborating with such artists as Drake and Lil Wayne — is now best known for his mastery of a social network largely favored by teens who think Instagram requires too many words (and who like the idea that the Snaps disappear in 24 hours). Khaled first signed up for Snapchat in October, after noticing that other musicians he worked with used it. He began sharing videos of himself living enthusiastically: swigging Listerine from a bottle while getting ready, hanging out with Jay Z. It took him only about a month to get 20 million followers — almost as many people as tuned in to this year’s Grammy Awards, and nearly in the same stratosphere as Kylie Jenner, the world’s top Snapper but one who, being both an actual teenager and a Kardashian, enjoys an advantage.
Khaled’s appeal on the app is a bit harder to pin down. Occasionally, his story lines are epic, like the time he live-Snapped his adventures getting lost at sea last December. He was returning from Rick Ross’s house, via Jet Ski, inviting viewers to “Ride wit me through the journey of life.” But the sun was setting fast, and confusion set in. He was eventually fine — never lost a cell-phone signal, and went viral in the process — but concluded to his followers, “The key is not to drive your Jet Ski in the dark.” Most of the time, though, the content of Khaled’s Snapchat is mundane: tending to his beloved plants, engaging in some self-care, proferring advice.
Of his own appeal, “it’s just me being me,” Khaled explains, platitudinous even in casual conversation. “The world is inspired by it, and I’m so honored that they’re inspired, because I always tell myself I gotta be inspired by myself.” This line of thought isn’t a totally new turn for him. All Khaled’s music could credibly be termed “Motivation Rap” — album titles include We the Best, We Global, We the Best Forever — but relentless bombast can be exhausting by the end of a four-minute song. On Snapchat, repetitive sound bites make for meme-ready catnip. It might be the only form of self-help the internet generation can handle — a little bit ironic, highly comical. Khaled’s philosophies can sometimes sound like Tony Robbins had a baby with The Secret and they decided to raise it as a Quaker. I’d suggest some Zen Buddhism in the mix, because Khaled meditates regularly, but he likes possessions too much. “I tell myself every day I love my Jacuzzi, I love my marble floors, I love my high ceilings,” he ticks off. “I love having an unlimited supply of cocoa butter.”
Nas and Khaled do a take. Khaled stops to cut and light a fresh cigar. He starts again, in his hype-man voice: “Nas, DJ Khaled, Biggest Interview. Major Keys. Icon Alert. DJ Khaaaled.” He keeps mixing up how he lands the pronunciation of his own name. First it’s Kha-led, like a one-two punch. Then Khaaaaaled, like a song, and then Khaled! like he’s so excited to be DJ Khaled. He Snaps out the final version — Kha-led — under his handle @djkhaled305.
“My phone is buzzin’! It’s lit now,” says Nas seconds after Khaled puts his Snap out. They exchange a combination of hand grabs and backslaps before Nas leaves, then Khaled’s entourage erupts into a conversation that is 99 percent parroting Khaledisms.
The Independent Journal-Review is a terrible website that publishes the latest in headline-construction and viral-content-packaging technology in service of a conservative agenda. It is a sort of right-wing Upworthy? Sample headline: “Monuments Around the World Lit Up in Support of France. With One Glaring Exception …” (The exception is the White House.) The Independent Journal-Review is also, as of today, the largest conservative-politics fan-fiction site on the planet.
You might associate fan fiction — fictional stories written about characters, real or imagined, that the author did not personally come up with — with video-game characters exploring their sexuality. You wouldn’t be wrong, necessarily, but you’d be limiting yourself. One of the oldest fan-fiction communities is political opinion columnists on a deadline — a proud tradition continued on the IJ-Review site today by Kurt Schlichter, trial lawyer, author, and retired army colonel. His fan fiction, “What Defeating ISIS Would Look Like,” is a masterpiece of repressed slash, featuring a “young and usually quite calm” president who is the “Cuban-American son of immigrants” (which means he understands tyranny and … how to deal with it”) and an aggressive marine nicknamed “The Wildman”:
We should pause here and note that unless Schlichter, a weekly columnist and author of a book called Conservative Insurgency: The Struggle to Take America Back 2009-2041, is undertaking an extremely long con, this is absolutely, 100 percent, in earnest. (Needless to say, it’s also utterly psychopathic: He’s arguing that the U.S. should flatten a 200,000-person city to kill a tenth as many people.)
Already a cult figure among amateur and professional conservative baiters for his frequent tweets about his “hot wife,” Schlichter’s reached an even wider audience with his latest. The fanfic has been a huge hit on Twitter, where the columnist is eagerly responding to his fans and critics. (Sample: “I don’t presume to tell you about shitty alt-folk acoustic hipster bands, so don’t presume to tell me about military strategy.”) He’s coy about which particular Cuban-American candidate is featured, Rubio or Cruz. The tributes and parodies are legion.
In on-the-nose news: An elderly woman in Shanghai this week was spotted bowing to a life-size statue of Garen, one of the characters in League of Legends. According to lore, he is “the pride of the Demacian military and leader of the Dauntless Vanguard.” So that’s cool.
Shanghaiist points out that the statue “bears quite the resemblance to Lord Guan, a Chinese general during the Three Kingdoms period, immortalized in one of China’s most famous books, and turned into a god.” And where centuries-old spiritual traditions and aggressive marketing campaigns collide, you get extremely viral stories.
That being said, if this woman is the first person to genuflect before a League of Legends character, then I’m the king of England.
On these issues, Apple has a particular advantage over its biggest rival, Google, which has a bad reputation with privacy experts (Snowden himself has suggested that people not use it). But this is thanks less to a particular ethos or set of values than to a business model: Apple sells objects; Google sells user data. Apple can afford to have a relatively — relatively — good track record on data-collection, privacy, and security (and it does). Google quite literally can’t. A letter and a stand reestablishing Apple’s supremacy is a good reminder to customers that Apple is on the right side of the issues they care about.
Which isn’t to suggest that Cook or his employees are taking on the FBI for anything less than the noblest reasons. Just to point out that — so long as we’ve managed to hand off our side in civil-liberties battles to for-profit corporations — we’re lucky that the right thing to do for privacy and the right thing to do for Apple’s business happen to be aligned these days.
One of the oddest consequences of handing over so much of our lives to a set of complicated, interdependent, and complex technologies is that fights over our rights in that sphere are largely out of our hands. If the FBI wants a backdoor into our iPhones — devices we tend to treat like family members — there’s very little we can directly do to stop them. We need to rely on Apple to fight for us. In this sense, it’s heartening to read Apple CEO Tim Cook’s kiss-off letter to the feds, published on Apple’s website Tuesday night, refusing to grant a federal judge’s request to help the FBI break into the phone of Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters:
The security question at hand is relatively simple. Farook used a password-protected iPhone 5C, which the FBI would like to access. To the best of our knowledge, the only way to gain access to the phone (short of someone telling the FBI the right password) would be to “brute-force” the password — that is, guess as many combinations possible until the phone opened up. Right now, the only way to enter passwords is by hand, which would entail putting some poor junior agent in a room for the next several decades pecking out passwords one at a time. And since most iPhones will automatically erase after ten failed-password tries, that would likely not work either.
But if the FBI could load its own firmware — elementary, foundational software — onto the phone, it could theoretically bypass the ten-failure threshold, and hook the phone directly up to a powerful computer to brute-force the password, saving the life and time of our hypothetical junior agent.
This is where Apple comes in. Apple’s phones won’t allow their firmware to be updated or replaced unless the new firmware has an Apple “signature” (essentially, a complicated cryptographic protocol to determine whether the firmware is legitimate). The FBI doesn’t have the keys necessary to “sign” a firmware update or override as Apple. You can guess where this is going: The judge has ordered Apple to provide “reasonable technical assistance” to the FBI, possibly including “providing the FBI with a signed iPhone software file[.]”
The FBI insists that this would be a one-time deal: firmware for this phone, and this phone only. Apple disagrees: “The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone,” Cook’s letter reads. “But that’s simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.” In other words: No.
Why would Apple say no to the FBI? The first, obvious, and indisputably correct answer is that it’s the right thing to do: “We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government,” Cook writes. He’s right: This is a case of government overreach — and the latest in a series of rulings that distort the All Writs Act of 1789 in attempts to force corporations to assist the government in creating back doors, brute-forcing, or otherwise bypassing security measures.
But it’s also worth noting that this very public letter is coming in a post–Snowden leaks context, where — following embarrassing revelations of the extent to which the NSA was tapping into supposedly private data — tech companies are jockeying to demonstrate their commitment to privacy and security.
While Apple and the FBI go to court over the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone, the Justice Department is facing another technical hurdle in its own investigation. This weekend, the New York Times reported that a wiretap order has been hindered by the end-to-end encryption on Facebook-owned WhatsApp, one of if not the most popular messaging services in the world.
Months ago, WhatsApp began encrypting all of its messages using "end-to-end" encryption, so-called because the keys for decrypting messages are held only by the recipient. End-to-end encryption, which is both simple and extremely secure, is increasingly standard in messaging apps, in part because its presence means that the companies making the apps can’t crack encrypted messages even if ordered to do so by the government. In this case, the Feds have a wiretap warrant — but because they’d need the locally stored encryption keys to read any of the messages they’d intercept, it’s effectively useless. (The details of the case are under seal, but unlike the showdown over the San Bernardino shooter’s phone, this one does not involve terrorism.)
This isn’t the first time that E2E has caused headaches for law enforcement. Last fall, Apple’s iMessage system came under criticism for offering a similar mechanism, preventing law enforcement from accessing messages. They considered suing Apple for assistance, but backed off. Needless to say, this issue has been near its boiling point for a while. Overseas, a WhatsApp executive was recently briefly detained by authorities in Brazil over encrypted messages.
The legal stalemate right now could be potentially be resolved with new wiretap laws — but so far no one seems willing to push:
As all of this is going on, tech companies are beefing up their security mechanisms. The Guardian reports that Facebook (owner of WhatsApp), Google, and Snapchat are all working on developing more secure messaging systems.
This month’s cover story in The New Republic focuses on “the secret lives of Tumblr teens,” the self-aware, surrealist powerhouse that encompasses a smaller but far more active section of adolescent web users.
In many ways, Tumblr is one of the last holdouts of the old, anonymous internet, where people’s online lives were entirely separable from their offline ones. Tumblr’s active population of minors, who understand that search engines have a long memory, are better than most adults at maintaining that boundary. It’s what allowed an anonymous Australian teenager named “Pizza” to gain a million followers and a rabid fanbase.
And of course, though it’s not as obvious as it might be on other social networks, people try to monetize it. And much like your favorite Twitter accounts, it’s two dudes (in this case, Zach Lilley and Jeremy Greenfield) pretending to be girls. They basically applied Sabermetrics to Tumblr.
And then they starting selling fad diet pills through affiliate links and raking in money hand over fist, building up a network of link-swaps and click fraud that for a brief time brought in tens of thousands of dollars a month. Pizza was occasionally earning more than her mother, a real-estate agent. Eventually, it also got the million-follower Pizza Tumblr shut down for violating Tumblr’s terms of use.
The piece is a microcosm of a hard truth that older people might struggle to understand: “Making money on the internet” is now simply “making money.” Joining ad networks and farming clicks isn’t really the digital equivalent of a lemonade stand, but for a growing number of teenagers today, it’s just as easy to set up.
The boy’s mother defended his actions as "harmless" (which they are), though she conceded that, yes, some people find clowns scary. Eventually, reporters tracked down the original clown, who said that he will not stop. He will continue to clown.
A specter is haunting Wisconsin — the specter of a guy in a creepy clown costume. In what has now become a subgenre of weird internet horror pranks, a teenage jokester and a copycat have been dressing up as scary clowns and standing around the lucky town of Waukesha.
Local ABC affiliate WISN managed to track down the clown, who local police described as a “developmentally delayed” teen.
Another clown seen later in the week near Carroll University, sporting a different “Joker-type” appearance, is believed to be a copycat.
Information security expert Chris Eng has an “ebooks” bot on Twitter, a kind of alter ego that analyzes the text of his tweets and uses the patterns it finds to automatically spit out new tweets that sound like him. The trope is named after horse_ebooks, the first well-known nonsensical Twitter bot, and although it’s no longer operational, it started a phenomenon. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of ebooks bots on Twitter now. But nobody told that to the unfortunate humans working Twitter support for Samsung.
Bots pretty much run themselves, with very little human observation required. When Eng decided to check on his bot this week, he discovered that something strange had happened:
Someone on Samsung’s Twitter support team had read one of the bot’s pseudo-random tweets, “Battery life on Galaxy S4?” as a request for help, and immediately sprang into action. The bot talked back, nonsensically, but Samsung’s tweeters were determined to keep trying until they could close their support ticket.
Around and around they went:
Did Samsung support not realize they were talking to a bot? Had chris_ebooks gotten itself on to a list of people to help, with no hope of getting off? Or does networked capitalism make bots of us all?
These are all fair questions, considering that the bot’s Twitter bio is entirely unambiguous: “I am a Markov Chain bot (i.e. these tweets are generated automatically by a computer program). In other words, do not take me seriously.” Looks like no one at Samsung caught that last part.

Saturday is the 20th anniversary of Pokémon, the Nintendo juggernaut franchise. And what a 20 years it’s been! There are more than 700 Pokémon in existence, and with more on the way, it’s tough not to feel like we’ve exhausted our ideas. Latter-day Pokémon often feel like they were created in a George Glass or Keyser Soze–esque improv session. These are the worst-best offenders.
Skrelp.
Eelektrik
You know a dad made this one.
Vanilluxe
This is just two ice-cream cones. It evolved from one ice-cream cone. Someone was eating ice cream and decided, “AAAAAAAHHH, screw it. Ice-cream monster.”
Cottonee
A tuft of cottonee with a face??
Trubbish
Trash-bag Pokémon. What else is there to say? Literal trash.
Litwick
This is just a candle. A candle that evolves into a lamp, which then evolves into a chandelier.
Wailord
This is just a whale. It’s name literally contains the syllable “whale.”
backup
iCloud, Apple’s cloud service, automatically backs up phone data. But it only creates automatic backups when the device is connected to a trusted Wi-Fi network and charging. As part of its investigation, the FBI had the password on Farook’s account reset, disabling the auto-backups.
If the automatic iCloud backups had continued, the phone’s data would be accessible to the FBI on Apple’s iCloud servers — and the FBI wouldn’t need to access the phone itself, and the judge wouldn’t have issued the order to Apple.
Usage: There are a lot of important drawings of Sonic and Tails kissing on my phone, so it’s set to create a backup automatically.
brute-force attack
A crude intrusion tactic that relies on, well, brute force. Let’s say you’re trying to guess a 4-digit passcode. If you know the device’s owner, you might try entering their birthday (which is definitely not my passcode). Or maybe a lucky number, or their wedding date. A brute-force attack wouldn’t even try to intuit those details; it would start at 0000 and iterate one by one up to 9999.
A brute-force attack is one that tries every option. It’s not efficient and aside from the simplest passwords, would take years to complete. An iPhone can process an unlock code every 80 milliseconds. A four-digit passcode would take 13 minutes to crack; a six-digit one would take 22.2 hours. According to Apple’s latest security whitepaper, “it would take more than 5½ years to try all combinations of a six-character alphanumeric passcode with lowercase letters and numbers.”
Usage: Karen uses the same PIN every time, so we don’t need to brute-force attack to gain access to her account.
cloud
In this case, “cloud” is short for “cloud computing.” The cloud refers to computer operations that are handled remotely — on big server farms somewhere else in the world, and not locally, on your phone or computer. Many of your mobile device’s functions, such as email or Siri, are executed remotely via the cloud. When a file is stored “in the cloud,” it’s stored on a disk that is linked to the computer via the internet, as opposed to local storage, which refers to the hard drive in a computer. A central component of the current dispute is that Farook’s iPhone’s data is not accessible via the cloud — it’s only stored locally.
The current public dispute between Apple and the FBI concerning San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook’s iPhone is complicated and messy, full of technical details, software intricacies, and big (and scary) gaps in knowledge about the hardware details and engineering capabilities of the government and Apple. It’s also extremely important. If you want to follow this case without drowning in jargon, here’s a glossary you can reference whenever you’d like to sound smart.
Usage: All of my family photos are in the cloud so I can access them on any device.
Device Firmware Upgrade Mode
An iPhone mode in which iOS doesn’t load, but the phone can still interact with software (like iTunes). Putting a phone into this mode is how jail breakers (people who install custom software on iOS) get around certain restrictions; it’s what the FBI would activate to install the Software Image File that it is directing Apple to craft.
Usage: Hey, reboot the phone into Device Firmware Upgrade mode so I can install this sweet new custom iPhone software.
encryption
A system of protecting data and information stored on a computer. Encrypted data is basically unreadable unless it is “unlocked” by an encryption key. Without the right passcode to unlock the iPhone, the files on it remain encrypted and unreadable to the FBI.
Usage: I encrypt all of my My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fanfic because there are spies everywhere.
Federal Bureau of Investigation
The government agency hoping to gain access to the iPhone in question, which belonged to one of the San Bernardino shooters.
Usage: [at a bar] I work for the FBI, which stands for Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Apple
firmware
Base-level software that powers most computer technology. On an iPhone, the firmware is what runs before the operating system boots up. Because it runs at the lower levels of a computer, firmware vulnerabilities allow deeper levels of intrusion, are more difficult to detect, and don’t disappear if, say, a device’s OS is wiped completely. In this case, the FBI is asking for custom firmware that will disable the security delays that deter brute-force attacks, allowing them to enter passcode guesses as fast as the hardware will allow.
Usage: I just installed a new firmware upgrade for my router, which patches a security vulnerability. Wait, why are you leaving?
iCloud
A suite of “cloud” services offered by Apple which ties into iOS and its other operating system, Mac OS X. iCloud offers, among other features, remote file storage and syncing between devices, as well as automatic backups of mobile devices.
Usage: I love to sync my files across devices with iCloud.
passcode
The code required to unlock and access information stored on the iPhone. Standard iOS passcodes used to be four digits, but the default was upped to six digits on iOS 9. Users can make their passwords more complex if they’d like, using alphanumeric characters as well as punctuation symbols.
On the iPhone in question, iOS 9 introduces time delays between incorrect passcode entries. The device is wiped after the tenth incorrect entry. That makes it impossible for the FBI to try to brute-force the passcode in its current state.
Usage: My passcode is absolutely not my birthday, so don’t even try it. Seriously. That’s not it.
A computer company based in California. Apple makes the iPhone hardware and the operating system that powers it. Last week, Apple was ordered by a federal judge to create a software package disabling some of the iPhone’s built-in security features and to help the FBI load it onto an iPhone owned by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters. Apple refused, and its CEO, Tim Cook, authored an open letter objecting to the order.
Secure Enclave
A processor in newer iPhone models that’s completely separate from the rest of the device. It handles all cryptographic operations on the iPhones and enforces security measures like the passcode delays and wiping the device after ten failed attempts; it also processes fingerprint authentication for Touch ID. Because it’s separate from the rest of the device, it’s theoretically more secure.
The iPhone 5c owned by the San Bernardino shooter does not have a Secure Enclave. But because it’s a key feature of other Apple products that the FBI might be interested in, security experts are concerned: If a precedent is set that Apple must comply with the current order, what’s to stop them from also being ordered to create software that alters the Secure Enclave? (This sets aside the still-open question of whether it’d be possible to alter the secure enclave.)
Usage: Even if we rebooted the iPhone, passcode delays would not be reset because they are handled separately, by the Secure Enclave.
signing keys
In order to upgrade software or firmware on an iPhone, the device needs to ensure that the upgrade is legitimate. Signing keys are authentication files that Apple uses to confirm the origins of its software upgrades. Software like the type the FBI wants needs to include Apple’s signing key in order to be installed on the device. If Apple were ordered to turn over their signing keys, the FBI would be able to install its own software on any iOS device. The FBI is not currently requesting these and it’s highly unlikely but not impossible that Apple would be forced to hand them over.
Usage: [Extremely big government voice] Now that we have Apple’s signing keys, we can loaded secret spying software onto any device we want.
Software Image File
The piece of software that the FBI is directing Apple to build. They want software that will disable the time delays between passcode inputs, allowing them to enter each one as fast as possible, every 80 milliseconds. Given that it could take up to five and a half years to crack a six-character alphanumeric code, one could intuit that the FBI is probably working on a more simple four- or six-digit code. Some are referring to it, cutely, as FBiOS.
Usage: Hey, Tim, FBI here. Can you make us a custom Software Image File for this iPhone?
Usage: I just purchased a new iPhone from Apple.
backdoor
An unpublicized and covert vulnerability in software that can be exploited for surveillance or intelligence-gathering purposes. Essentially what it sounds like: a secret method of getting access to a system.
Intelligence agencies like the NSA have tried to push tech companies to build backdoors into their systems for the government to use whenever it deems necessary. Every major tech company has denied being complicit in building backdoors into their systems.
Usage: Hello, hacker friends, I found a backdoor in the latest software update that lets us steal info from users.
Teens have always risked their lives in stupid dares, but social networks make it a lot easier for bad stunt ideas to spread — see, for example, the condom challenge, the fire challenge, and the choking game. The latest dumb viral thing to almost kill someone is the duct-tape challenge, wherein kids have their buddies wrap them in duct tape and then they attempt to Houdini their way out of it.
If kids want to duct-tape themselves, fine. I’m not going to go all the-writers-of-TV’s–Law & Order on them. There are worse things they could do with their time. But it’s not a great idea, as demonstrated by an unfortunate Washington teen who severely damaged his head while attempting a duct-tape escape.
Skylar Fish, 14, had won two previous duct-tape challenges, according to Seattle Fox station KCPQ-13, but the third time went awry when he fell over and slammed his head against a metal window frame. He split his head open, suffering bleeding in his brain and severe damage to one eye. He may not be able to see out of it again.
“If he would have hit on it differently, an inch over, he could have died,” Skylar’s mother, Sarah Fish, told KCPQ. “If his friend didn’t flip him over when he was having a seizure and choking up blood, he could have died.”
The Fish family is asking other teens not to bind their arms and legs with duct tape for fun, which may be a losing battle. There are about 70,000 results on YouTube for “duct tape challenge,” some dating back more than a year. It’s not a tremendously popular trend, but it doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, either.
“Smart toys” equipped with cameras and microphones can do things that the toys of our youth never could — like letting kids record videos and look up the answers to their questions — but they also come with a new set of worries about privacy and security. Last year, a Barbie doll with speech-recognition capabilities sparked concerns that recordings of children talking to their toys could wind up in the wrong hands. This month, it’s a cute teddy bear with a camera in its nose.
Fisher Price’s Smart Toy Bear uses its camera to scan “smart cards” that let it play games and tell jokes with kids, and it also comes with a remote-control app for parents. They can pick stories and games for the bear to play, or have it let the kids know when it’s time to brush their teeth, take a break, or go to bed.
It seems like a pretty cool toy, actually. But because everything is terrible, our kids’ toys need better internet security than they’re getting. Vice’s Motherboard blog reports that there was a security flaw in the parental-control app that made it possible to find the name, birth date, and gender of any kid using the toy.
Security firm Rapid7, which found the bug, told Vice that although information like addresses and credit-card numbers wasn’t exposed, the names and birth dates would make it “a lot easier for me to present myself as somebody who ought to know the kid’s name, or the kid’s birthday.”
The bug has been fixed now, but it highlights a challenge that gets exponentially more difficult as all of the stuff in our lives becomes networked. We’re used to worrying about securing our phones and computers, but companies are giving us hackable, internet-connected refrigerators and toy bears faster than security measures and best practices are catching up.
Wired published a report on our growing, very exploitable “Internet of Things” in December, focusing in part on the companies that are working to secure it.
“Cyber Barbie is now part of the kill chain,” one of the researchers told them.
You may have seen the pictures floating around the internet: a black cat with a white splotch on her front, her paws awkwardly splayed up and out. If you click through the gallery below, you’ll see her strike her trademark pose against a variety of backgrounds. Meet “Goal Kitty,” the internet’s newest celebrity cat:
But why does Goal Kitty strike such an unusual and inspirational pose? An expose by BuzzFeed reveals her tragic secret: a coconut-oil addiction.
BuzzFeed explains: “Her human, Peter Mares, told BuzzFeed that she started doing it one morning as a sort of stretch and he grabbed his camera. The next morning, she did the same thing and he rewarded her with her favorite: coconut oil. Now it’s become so routine that ‘she has come to recognize the camera, and does these “goal hands” whenever she sees it.’”
Ah, but at what price fame? At what price cuteness?
In this video, Syori falls in love with a parking space and there’s a (I think?) twist ending.
Okay!
I’m not really sure what to tell you here. Mashable has alerted me to the existence of the Facebook page for Syori, where a woman whom I presume is Syori posts odd videos reenacting movies and making food, but in really weird ways.
In this video, Syori becomes Sadness from the hit film Inside Out by dumping blue paint on herself and repeating the phrase “I’m sad” over and over.
Here, Syori becomes the Little Mermaid, but one who eats her octopus friends and then later passionately kisses a dead fish.
This one, called “Picasso,” show Syori using her body to paint a piece of paper and yelling “PICASSOOO!” over and over while Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies” plays in the background.”
In “Hamburger Fighter,” Syori celebrates fast food.
No one (living) is more viral right now than El Chapo (real name: Joaquín Guzmán), the Mexican drug cartel kingpin who was recently captured following a daring prison break, months on the run, and an excruciating interview with decent actor/bad writer Sean Penn for an article published by Rolling Stone.
Video of the meeting was captured, as well as an image of Penn and Guzmán shaking hands. And, of course, the question on everyone’s mind was “Those shirts are killer. How can I get El Chapo’s look?”
One might assume, as I would, that having your clothing brand associated with a notorious, violent criminal who has left an awful trail of devastation during his decades-long rise to power might be a bad thing. But not Barabas, which is milking its status as the favored apparel of El Chapo for all that it’s worth.
Here is the current front page of Barabas’s site:
The company also took the time to spread the word on Facebook. The shirt featured in the photo of Penn shaking hands costs $128, according to The Daily Mail. (I would look it up myself, but the site is currently overloaded with traffic.)
Barabas’s slogan is “Good Words, Good Thoughts, Good Deeds.”
It’s clear that Instagram’s notifications aren’t meant for celebrities with millions of followers. The price of fame is an endless stream of like-and-comment spam that renders your Instagram account — and maybe your entire phone — unusable. We saw it happen last week to a popular Dutch soccer player, and now it’s happening with fitness model Jen Selter, whose butt is hugely Instagram-famous.
Perhaps inspired by footballer Demy de Zeeuw, who made a video of his notifications that went modestly viral last week, Selter decided to see what would happen if she switched on notifications. With 8.4 million followers, and hundreds of thousands of likes and comments on every photo she posts, this is what her notifications looked like on Monday:
And she hadn’t even put anything new on her Instagram that day! You’ve got to wonder whether it would be even worse directly after posting a new shot of her famous butt, or whether what we’re seeing here is the maximum speed at which an iPhone can display new alerts.
One thing is certain, though: Jen Selter is probably not reading your comments.
Her video about how many Instagram interactions she gets has already received 110,000 likes and more than 10,000 comments, all of which would have contributed to melting her iPhone if she’d left notifications turned on.
Starting this morning, Facebook is rolling out its long-threatened new “reactions” feature, an “extension” of the like button that adds five new ways to interact with posts you come across on your news feed. Where once users encountering tragic, shocking, or bone-chilling news items — famine, war, death, Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian’s relationship — could only “like” those posts, they are now offered a full spectrum of human emotion: “like,” “love,” “haha,” “wow,” “sad,” and “angry.”
The new buttons will start appearing on desktop and mobile starting this morning. If you’re not seeing them yet, you’ll probably have to wait — it will take a while for the change to deploy across Facebook’s millions of users. We’ve demonstrated before how to use them.
The change is a response to the longtime complaint that the “like” button is inadequate to the many things you feel when you encounter your Facebook feed. (Still, no “existential dread” reaction.) But you’ll notice there’s no “dislike” button: According to a Businessweek article from a few weeks ago, it was “rejected on the grounds that it would sow too much negativity.”
Best of luck to James Woods, an abrasive war hawk whom I imagine is stomping around throwing a tantrum like the gigantic baby from Honey, I Blew Up the Kid.
Actor James Woods is continuing to pursue his lawsuit against a pseudonymous Twitter user who called him a “cocaine addict.” A judge denied the defendant’s request to dismiss the lawsuit earlier this week, meaning that the user known as @AbeListed could be unmasked at some point. Twitter has so far refused to comply with requests to hand over the user’s real identity, citing First Amendment rights.
In the lawsuit, Woods — who is now mostly famous for posting conservative memes on the web — is seeking $10 million in damages for the cocaine tweet. “AL’s reckless and malicious behavior, through the worldwide reach of the Internet, has now jeopardized Woods’s good name and reputation on an international scale,” the initial complaint read. I mean, I’d argue that getting beet red and nude online and demanding $10 million because an anonymous commenter once said you use drugs is more embarrassing than the original tweet itself. But what do I know?
Woods’s argument boils down to the assertion that some people might have believed the tweet. A seven-page report from a linguistics professor, commissioned by Woods’s legal team, states as much. Possibly related: The professor who wrote that report was paid $450 an hour to do so.
In a press release, Lisa Bloom, lawyer for the defendant, said, “Twitter is a wide-open forum where wisecracks are the norm. It exists not only for the rich and powerful to lambaste others, but for all users to express themselves, often colorfully, without fear of being dragged into expensive, stressful litigation.”
And, of course, James Woods would never ever use Twitter to call other people cocaine users.
Update: Jezebel has a scoop: Nina and Randa are 22. Twenty-two! We therefore are defining “teen” in the phrase “Social-Media Teen Celebrity World” to include anyone under 23.
Like the mob, the world of teenage stars on YouTube and Instagram doesn’t take kindly to informants and turncoats. So when Australian Instagram celebrity Essena O’Neill announced that she was quitting Instagram over the pressure of keeping up her idealized Instagram account — which she went through and edited earlier this week with new captions indicating the labor and cost that went into every shot — she suddenly found herself the target of a set of videos from former friends. Welcome to teen-social-media-celebrity hell.
Essena has not exactly dropped off the face of the planet since she quit social media. In a Vimeo video yesterday (her third in as many days), O’Neill told viewers that she’s “never been happier than this moment” with tears streaming down her face. “I was scared that no one wants to hear the truth, everyone’s going to think I’m an attention seeker.”
Not everyone did. But twin YouTube musicians — and former friends of Essena — Nina and Randa certainly do. Nina and Randa posted a video today claiming that Essena’s meltdown is due to a breakup with a guy she met through them while staying at their house in Los Angeles. “Essena wasn’t in Los Angeles working, she was on vacation,” they say. “Who is she talking about, being all miserable? How were any of us fake to you?”
Not one to stay on the sidelines when there are video views to be snagged, Nina and Randa’s brother Willie posted his own version of Essena’s exit. “Are there some people who are fake here?” he says. “Absolutely. There are fake people all over the world.”
O’Neill, for her part, weighed back in, again on Vimeo. “Looks like media want attention and a ‘hot story’, not real change. AM I THE ONLY ONE OVER THIS???” she wonders. No, Essena! Not at all!
You might think these thought-provoking video lectures on the peculiar ontology of social media would be all the world could bear. You’d be wrong! British YouTuber Acacia Brinley has likewise responded with a taped, off-the-cuff essay. “This is what happens when you mix social media and creating a brand with your own life and your own personality. It’s hard to put yourself out there as a brand,” she says. “You’re getting mixed up between modeling world and social media world.”
O’Neill’s emotions are genuine, and her critiques clearly hit a nerve (and an attention/engagement jackpot from which many people can benefit). But she’s not exactly gone from the internet. A colleague in the vegan community — you read that right — plvntstrong, made another Essena critique video, saying, “She deleted a bunch of YouTube videos but she’s creating a website so she’s not really leaving social media, she’s just switching her platform.”
Ah, yes: O’Neill appears to have actually left Instagram for good, taking down her account, but those who miss her (and aren’t satiated by her Vimeo videos) will be glad to remember that her departure accompanied the launch of her new site, Let’s Be Game Changers, which features “Game Changing Stuff” (including Amanda Palmer TED Talk videos), “Behind the Image” (essays about her Instagram photos), and a forum. “She’s still using social media to further her (amazing) agenda,” fashion blogger bryanboy posted on Instagram. Oddly, a section devoted to “cool products” appears to have been removed since yesterday.
“Log off” and “Delete your account” are common refrains when someone says a gross and unpardonable thing on the internet, but in this case, the ranting woman with the ruined New Year actually did it. Apparently, the public’s scorn was just too much for her.
A representative for the bar told Chicago’s WGN that they’d prefer if people didn’t try to track down the angry customer — which makes sense, because their own manager had already delivered the definitive burn.
A woman whose New Year’s Eve was “ruined” at an Indiana bar vented her frustration on the restaurant’s Facebook page the next day, hoping someone would lend a sympathetic ear to the woeful story of her night. You see, someone almost died of a heart attack that evening. Which brings us to the real tragedy: While the victim was being revived by paramedics, the real victim says the distraught servers messed up her “700+” bill. The woman’s rant (and a bar manager’s snappy response) got popular online and made regional news, and she’s now deleted her Facebook account. Her 2016 is off to an excellent start.
“"I will never go back to this location for New Year’s Eve!!! After the way we were treated when we spent 700+ and having our meal ruined by watching a dead person being wheeled out from an overdose my night has been ruined!!!” the woman wrote, single-handedly exhausting the entire U.S. supply of exclamation points for the year after only one day.
“The manager also told us someone dying was more important than us being there making us feel like our business didn’t matter, but I guess allowing a Junkie in the building to overdose on your property is more important than paying customers who are spending a lot of money!!”
But the dying person, the victim described as a “junkie” by this important, high-rolling customer who spent New Year’s at Kilroy’s in Indianapolis, was not a junkie at all. She was a 70-year-old woman, a fellow "paying customer" who had suffered a heart attack. And she didn’t die, thanks to EMTs, although our ranter makes it clear that’s not the important part.
Bar manager Chris Burton told the real story in his snarky response on Facebook, explaining that “This poor lady, who was celebrating New Year’s Eve with her husband and son, had to be placed on the floor of a completely packed bar and have her shirt removed in front of everyone so the paramedics could work on her”
“But I completely understand why you think being intoxicated (expletive) that didn’t understand your bill should take priority over a human life.”
As shares to news sites from Facebook plummet — and as publishers look toward Facebook to host their content — the social network is talking up its native videos: It recently boasted of surpassing 8 billion views a day on its videos (YouTube, in contrast, has 4 billion). But if this sounds too good to be true, it probably is. A viral (YouTube) video by the explainer series In a Nutshell claims that “725 of the 1,000 most-viewed videos on Facebook were stolen.”
The first problem is the instant auto-play that means cute animals are jumping all over your feed even if you don’t click on videos. A “view” is counted after the video is playing for three seconds, so if you’re just scrolling down your feed slowly, you might be counted as a “viewer” of a muted video you barely noticed. YouTube, by contrast, has a 30-second threshold, meaning that view counts are naturally lower.
Then, there’s the problem of stolen videos. “Freebooting” is the word for taking an original video from a different platform — YouTube, Vimeo, or maybe a Vine compilation — and uploading it on Facebook under your own account. Because Facebook, when deciding what appears in a user’s news feed, privileges videos uploaded to Facebook, the original YouTubers are at risk of having their videos go viral on a thieving page — receiving none of the advertising revenue themselves. The Facebook pirates can then use the huge fake-viral audience they’ve created off of stolen videos to sell ads or shill their own products.
If you’re not one of the millions of (generally young) people who watch videos on Facebook and YouTube the way teenagers 20 years ago watched cable TV, this might not seem important. But the online-video business is growing rapidly, and Facebook and YouTube (owned by Google) are jockeying to be the single most-important entertainment destination for an entire generation of consumers. If Facebook is promising its business partners 8 billion views, they should know where that number comes from.
The teen responsible for the “Damn, Daniel!” meme we’re all supposed to know about and tolerate has reportedly been SWATed. Riverside, California, police got a call at 1 a.m. Tuesday saying that someone at the residence of Josh Holz, who filmed the apparently ubiquitous viral video, had shot their mother with an AK-47, KABC reports, prompting a SWAT team to descend on the house. “Ever since their video has gone out there, they’ve received a number of what they call strange phone calls and emails,” Riverside police lieutenant Kevin Townsend told KABC. “A lot of strange things happening so tonight was just another incident for their family.”
This follows a quickly disproved rumor that Daniel Lara, the titular teen, was beaten up and robbed of his signature white Vans. The meme wars are getting brutal.
Now that the internet has been tamed and civilized, what is the new tech Wild West? Hoverboards. Freakin’ hoverboards. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas yesterday, two U.S. marshals appeared at a Chinese company’s booth to seize items, including a one-wheeled skateboard. The raid was the result of complaints from Silicon Valley company Future Motion, which claimed to have a patent on a similar skateboard. According to Bloomberg, “the company sent about a half-dozen people from its legal team to accompany the marshals in the raid.” The marshals removed all signage and merchandise from the booth, leaving the staff manning it unsure of what to do next.
Future Motion argued that the Chinese company, Changzhou First International Trade, was selling a knockoff of its own Onewheel, a self-balancing skateboard that has one wheel placed in the middle of the board. Changzhou’s similar item sells for about a third of the price on Alibaba, China’s largest e-commerce site. Ars Technica reports that lawyers for Future Motion filed a motion in court on Tuesday, and then had a seven-minute hearing via telephone on Wednesday. No one seems to have pointed out to Future Motion or Changzhou First International Trade that hoverboards are actually not cool.
Precisely who owns what when it comes to personal transportation devices like hoverboards and the Onewheel is very much in dispute. Despite hoverboards’ growing popularity, many people are fighting for control of the devices, and the profits that they generate. Many other people are just fighting to control the vehicles, period.
You can also broadcast your fight location, so that others can join. “With Rumblr Explore, anyone can browse and attend fights close by that other Rumblr users have arranged - all for free!” Sounds like a blast.
App mock-ups on the Rumblr site also list an Uber-type slider that lets users find fights under RumblrHER and RumblrGROUP.
I have requested access to Rumblr ahead of its launch and will report back after I have beaten up 10 billion losers.
Monday evening at 5 p.m., an app called Rumblr goes live. I’m going to use it to beat up a bajillion wimps. Described as “an app for recreational fighters to find, meet, and fight other brawl enthusiasts nearby,” Rumblr lets you find other people in your area who want to get their butts kicked.
(It’s right about now that you should be realizing this app is either a very bad idea or a marketing stunt for something else.)
Rumblr will apparently launch as a web app, and its creators say they are working on an iOS app. According to the NY Daily News, “the team was directly working with the iOS store to hash out legal issues preventing Rumblr’s approval.”
Here’s how it works: Users can set up a profile listing traits such as their physical stats and MMA specialties. They can then accept or reject fighters nearby, and if they both want to harm each other physically, then they get to chat.
Here is actual Rumblr marketing material, featuring user mattyice67 (who is not, it should be noted, holding a smartphone).
Once matched with someone you can trash-talk them and set up a time to fight. You also have the option to “Pussy Out.”
On the web, and in most editors, however, text isn’t fixed in quite the same way. Every time you load a page, you’re loading a set of documents that contain both the site’s contents and instructions to your browser, or client, telling it how to display those contents. An italic “a” isn’t a character in itself — it’s (I’m hand-waving a bit here) a roman “a,” accompanied by code instructing your browser to render it on the screen as an italic “a.” That code is the formatting. If that formatting is misinterpreted, or, worse, stripped out, as it often is when copying and pasting, or moving from one text editor to another, your “italic” a would appear roman.
If we all wrote directly inside the content-management systems where we publish our work to the world, this would be less of a problem. But very few of us do (for one thing, they generally don’t save your work). From assignment to publication, text can pass through several different editors, some of them made to handle richly formatted text in one particular way, some made to handle it in another, and some of them … not really made for that at all. A story that begins in Microsoft Word might then be pasted into Gmail and emailed to an editor using Outlook; from Outlook it might be pasted again into Google Docs, before finally being pasted into the text box of a proprietary CMS, for example. In the process, it will likely have picked up (or lost) stray bits of HTML formatting — odd <div> and <span> tags used by one text editor but not another — even if the text as written remains intact.
This extra HTML junk, or lost formatting, is extremely annoying, especially for copy editors and web producers, but in most cases it’s not a huge deal. It’s rare that an italicized or bolded word will have a vastly different meaning than its roman equivalent. But formatting can matter a lot when it’s being used to convey actual meaning to a reader, and not just design cues to the browser.
One particular hobbyhorse of mine, as an example: “strikethrough” formatting is meant to communicate to the reader “we originally wrote this, but now no longer stand by it.” It’s sometimes used with corrections in blog posts and news articles. But if stricken-through text loses its formatting, it will appear as normal, and readers likely won’t be able to tell that it’s wrong. The headline on this Gawker post — “Here Is a List of All the Assholes Handsome Law-Abiding Citizens Who Own Guns Some People in New York City” — is a good example: In 2013, the word “Assholes” and the phrases “Handsome Law-Abiding Citizens” and “Who Own Guns” were all stricken-through using strikethrough HTML formatting, creating a funny visual joke. When Gawker updated its content-management system, its headlines no longer supported strike-through, and this post now lives on under a totally incoherent headline.
Strike-through, where the formatting is meant to communicate that the text actually means the opposite of what you’re reading, is an obvious example. But it applies to block quoting, too. From a visual perspective, block-quote formatting is superior to your standard quotation mark — it’s a highly visible signal that the offset text should be understood differently than the surrounding paragraphs. But when considered in light of the particularity with which different browsers and email clients render formatting, and the ease with which formatting can be stripped entirely when copying and pasting, it becomes a liability. The humble quotation mark is unlikely to suffer the same indignities as the flashier <blockquote> tag when copied or pasted. Tags are no substitute for punctuation.
None of which is to blame the formatting, or the CMS, or the terrible tools we’ve developed to make publishing “easier,” for the Daily News’s error: King’s editors had a responsibility to ensure that his accurate sourcing was reproduced when published, no matter the vagaries of their CMS. (King, too, should probably have been reading his articles once they were published.) But a CMS that strips formatting — a specific and important kind of formatting — is setting up overworked editors to fail. To the extent that we rely on programs to do certain kinds of publishing work — and to the extent that we try to communicate meaning using HTML-formatting rather than “hard-coded” orthography — we’re asking to be misinterpreted.
One of the great promises of digital publishing has always been that it’s easier than old-fashioned printing. No presses needed, no warehouses, no infrastructure, no pesky typographical union: You type into a box, you hit the blue button, and you’ve published.
Of course “easier” usually just means that the work that used to be done by humans and machinery is now being done on and by computers. Publishing to the web is, in many ways, hugely more complicated than publishing on a printing press; it’s just that we trust our programs — the text editors we use to write and the content-management systems, or CMSes, we use to publish — to do most of the complicated work.
But as anyone who spends most of their time head-down in a CMS will tell you, CMSes (and text editors, and email clients), are not to be trusted. Just ask, for example, former New York Daily News editor Jotham Sederstrom, who was fired from his post on Tuesday after it was discovered that two pieces he’d edited by the writer Shaun King contained entire paragraphs lifted from other sources that weren’t correctly attributed. Emails furnished by King showed that his original copy (which he filed in the body of his emails — the sound you hear is my teeth grinding just thinking about that) had in fact correctly attributed the quotes:
Today, Sederstrom wrote a long, well-articulated apology on Medium, in which he takes full responsibility for the mistake. He also explains how it happened:
This may sound like a paltry excuse: a poor carpenter blaming his tools. And, obviously, Sederstrom and King both should have been checking the final product. But it’s also the kind of story that web editors everywhere will recognize immediately. After all: The only indication that King is directly quoting rather than paraphrasing is the indented block quote line. In other words, the line doesn’t exist in the text as written. It exists in the text as formatted.
It feels like a mystical distinction, and, in the supposedly more complicated earliest eras of print, it more or less was. Italic type and roman (that is, regular, straight) type were printed using actual different letters: the print block for the roman (that is, non-italic) “a” was an entirely different object than the print block for the italic “a.” Even now, well beyond the era of lead type, a printed “a,” roman or italic, is fixed on the page: once printed, it operates only as one thing.
It only takes three seconds to change a life. This video is those three seconds.
A brutal roasting, to be sure, and it didn’t stop after the police department’s original bulletin. During the following weeks, local wiseacres kept the joke alive in the comments of several unrelated posts on the page:
Finally, on Monday evening, the brave men and women of GMP Wigan East were able to make this announcement: “Caylan Clossick has just been arrested in Hindley.”
“EARS to you Merry Christmas, everybody’s having fun!” someone immediately replied.
Surely it’s moments like these that remind you why you joined the constabulary in the first place.
For the past couple of weeks, the Greater Manchester Police, Wigan East division has been trying to track down 18-year-old wanted person Caylan Clossick. They put out a bulletin on Facebook seeking information about his whereabouts, and followers were more than eager to contribute. Not tips, though: jokes and memes about Clossick’s prominent ears.
Our boy Caylan, wanted for unspecified reasons, has a pair of conspicuously protruding heary-holes, and a haircut that does nothing to cover them up. The people of Greater Manchester will not soon let him forget it.
They compared him to Mr. Potato Head, a satellite, and a wingnut. They said he was impossible to catch because he could probably fly with those things, and he’d hear you coming a mile away. And they speculated that, ten minutes into Dumbo and chill, he’d give you the face in his mugshot.
Who will you vote for?
As the presidential race heads into the first round of primaries and candidates do their best to woo voters, one major demographic has been largely overlooked: dank memers. (Dank memers are the patriotic, voting Americans who love and make memes, especially “dank” — good — ones.) Which candidate will pledge to increase our national store of memes? Who can best promise to increase our slipping rates of meme dankness? Who can ensure American meme hegemony while facing the rapid rise of Russian, Indian, Brazilian, and Nigerian memes? As far as Facebook’s top memers are concerned, there’s only one candidate: Barnie Sandlers.
Yes, you read that right. Barnie Sandlers is the only candidate speaking directly to memers, promising the dankest possible memes as we face a new century of American meme-making.
His foremost opponent? Anti-meme reactionary Dolan J. Tramp.
On Tuesday, an email message threatening a massacre caused the entire Los Angeles Unified School District to shut down for the day. Although authorities decided it was too risky to dismiss, the message bore a number of signs of being a prank. The writer claimed to represent an “army of allah,” but failed to capitalize allah; they threatened “every school” in a 1,000-school district, and they sent the email from a penis-themed domain name, cock.li.
Vice’s Motherboard blog got in touch with the owner of the playfully phallic webmail site and got the story of how cock.li came to host nearly 30,000 accounts. Would you be surprised to hear it started on 4chan?
Vincent Canfield, a software developer, told Motherboard that he bought cock.li to use as his own personal email domain. But two years ago, he mentioned it on 4chan, and people started asking if they could have their own cock.li accounts.
Why not? It’s not that much more demanding than having one or two accounts, and it pays for itself through donations. In a November blog post, Canfield considered the first two years of the site and concluded he might as well keep it going.
“I have ultimately accepted my fate and decided I will keep the water heated as long as the fish are still alive, and keep the tank big enough to hold everyone,” he wrote.
Now Canfield is providing mail services for a whole slew of foul domains, including the charming “horsefucker.org” and the much less charming “nigge.rs.” Between them, they host 60,000 total accounts for the denizens of 4chan and its unctious offshoot 8chan.
Going forward, though, he might face more law-enforcement scrutiny. Cock.li has received and complied with four subpoenas for user records over the past month or so, including one from the NYPD this week. New York City schools received a threat nearly identical to the one that closed down L.A. Unified, apparently also sent from a cock.li address.
That certainly doesn’t mean he should take it down, but other email services have chosen to go dark to protect their users’ privacy. Time will tell whether, unlike those, cock.li can stay up when the pressure is on.
It’s not just this guy — I get weird trolls and random Eastern European genitalia tweeted at me all the time. I’m really tired of looking at weird penises every time I want to make a dinosaur joke or see if my ex-boyfriend is alive. This is just a fairly regular thing many of us deal with on social media, particularly if we are women.
So I blocked the user, and reported the incident, using Twitter’s existing abuse protocol. Shortly after, I received an email informing me that the suggestion that a former secretary of State and I both have smelly vaginas did not constitute a violation of Twitter’s terms of service. I posted a screenshot of the email, and a few lines about how I would not be using Twitter until they figured out how to stop making incidents like this one (gross, but comparatively benign) a less constant component of my Twitter experience.
Now, you may be asking yourself: Why don’t you just block, report, and move on? A lot of people on Twitter, particularly white men wearing reflective sunglasses in their avatars, posed more or less this exact question to me. (I don’t mean to sunglass-shame, here; I only point out the fashion situation because it hurts even more to be dismissed by someone cool.)
The answer is: I do. These people — the vagina-smell people — make new accounts. Lots of ‘em. They come back. Which means blocking doesn’t fix the central problem: I don’t want to see aggressive, gross stuff every time I go on Twitter. I just don’t. And, well, as I wrote above, the last time I reported an account to Twitter for aggressive harassment and bad jokes, I was told it wasn’t in violation of Twitter’s terms of service. Okay, fine. Then if that’s not a violation in this space, I’m not sure I want to be in it.
To be clear, multiple Twitter employees were kind enough to reach out to offer me assistance with my particular case, and Twitter eventually sent me an email reversing their decision. One employee also assured me that Twitter is trying to make headway in making its service safer for women — and I’m sure that it is! — but as it stands, the dickheads still have the advantage. Do I think Twitter owes me anything? Nah. It just used to be a fun and pleasant place, which now feels totally inhospitable to women. That’s not a place I want to be.
Let me try to explain how I see it. Twitter is like a beloved public park that used to be nice, but now has a rusty jungle gym, dozens of really persistent masturbators, and a nighttime bat problem. Eventually the Parks Department might rip up the jungle gym, and make some noise about fixing the other problems, because that’s what invisible administrators like Twitter staff and municipal recreation departments tend to do. But if the perverts and the bats got to be bad enough with no recourse, you’d probably just eventually stop going.
(Additionally frustrating is that everybody is complaining about the safety issues at the park, and instead of addressing them, the city installs a crazy new slide. What? Nobody was calling for that. What about the perverts? What about the bats?)
I support public parks, and I support free speech. But getting bombarded with epithets and graphic images does not a love for humanity foster. I don’t know where these beardos got the idea that the First Amendment says, “Do whatever the fuck you want, it’s spring break, bitches.” Why do the laws of order and decency not apply to spaces where other people can’t tell you through basic social cues, or, barring that, Tasing, that you’re being a real asshole?
Technology has essentially ziplined past all the difficult social contract and legal infrastructure and face-to-face accountability that led us to negotiate limits on day-to-day expression. And instead of building any of that stuff, instead of addressing basic concerns of safety and gestalt and culture, our most popular platforms seem more concerned with “Haha”-face buttons and silly new engagement models.
I’d like to shift priorities. I want to elevate the need to address that people (particularly women) are being freely terrorized above whether or not a heart or a star is a more fun shape. And until that happens I can take walks and have picnics somewhere else.
A few days ago, I decided to stop using Twitter. Until recently I tweeted a few times a day — mostly to tell jokes, and to promote my work as a journalist and television writer. I’ve been using it since 2009, and have amassed about 170,000 followers. I like Twitter. Twitter has been good for me, and for my career. But there’s also been plenty of bad and unhealthy. And lately the scales have begun to tip heavily on the side of the negative.
There are a lot of essays out there about quitting Twitter as a lifestyle choice, so I should be clear: I’m not quitting forever. This isn’t an essay about growing up or moving across the country. I’m not quitting because it’s existentially bad for me, or making me a worse person, or ruining my attention span, or because I have poor impulse control, though those are all good reasons to quit.
I’m quitting Twitter for a specific, practical reason: Because I keep getting bothered by assholes and perverts and Twitter doesn’t seem willing or able to do anything about it. I’m quitting Twitter the way you quit your favorite restaurant when it suffers an E. coli outbreak. I’m quitting Twitter for the simple fact that Twitter’s been bumming me out.
Before I get into it, let me just get a few things out of the way so we all feel better. One, Jesus Christ, WHO CARES? Two, there are much, much bigger problems in the world, and there are smaller problems than this one that are marginally more interesting. Three, Twitter’s dumb; the internet’s dumb; I’m dumb; p.c. culture is dumb; I’m a whiny white lady who could stand to lose a few, etc. Go ahead. Get that stuff off your chest. Feel deep.
Let me also establish the subjects I’m not an expert in: constitutional law, mental health, queer theory, digital privacy, corporate responsibility. The list goes on! I’m Not an Expert in an almost impressive number of things related to the issue of online harassment. I’m writing based strictly on personal experience.
Sometime last week, an anonymous user of Twitter tweeted me a poorly Photoshopped image of a box of douches featuring the face of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, with text suggesting that she, and her supporters, have smelly vaginas.
I’ve never publicly stated a preference for any presidential candidate, nor does this guy have any insider knowledge on the conditions of my (frankly rather sparkling) vulvar ambiance. The truth is, aside from the sole fact of my being female and having a face, I’m not much of a good target. I’m not involved with gaming journalism, intense electoral politics, technology. Probably the most controversial stand I’ve taken on anything is being pro-pineapple as a pizza topping. While I have much respect for people who enjoy using Twitter for lively discourse, I mostly just want to make lame jokes.
But when opening the app even just to make a quick joke involves a cost-benefit analysis — “make a joke about oatmeal cookies and potentially see a bunch of swastikas and taints” — well, it’s time to step back. And that’s just for a dumb cookie jokester! Twitter is getting scary and shitty across the board, not just in certain spheres.
Car avatars, I wouldn’t know. Anime avatars, though, are fast approaching the egg avatar as the litmus test for “worth engaging,” especially around Gamergate and adjacent issues like “feminism.” Mother Jones’ Clara Jeffrey on Tuesday:
(Showing the gift for subtlety and irony that has endeared the Gamergate movement to journalists and the wider public, Gamergaters immediately began to mock Jeffrey for herself having an anime avatar.)
So the anime avatar and the egg avatar both end up meaning “block at will.” But not in the same way. Because they — like eagle or car avatars — don’t show actual identifiable human faces, anime avatars carry a strong whiff of “anonymous troll.” (One funny thing about egg avatars is that even the most toxic of them will often use real names!) They are also — and I say this as someone who can sing from memory the theme to Neon Genesis: Evangelion — nerdy.
What particularly interests me about the anime avatar is that it was initially (as I first encountered it, at any rate) a metonym for a weird-internet-politics group about as distant from Gamergate as you can find: a loosely affiliated community of hard-left self-proclaimed Maoists.
Third-worldist-feminist-communist-anime-avatar Twitter! What a world! What a time to be alive!
The internet is an extremely efficient communication machine, but it’s still a new space (really, a whole host of new spaces). Unlike the analog world, where each of us develops from birth a set of social and cultural cues that allow us to navigate through human interaction, the corresponding cues for digital communication are still being negotiated. How can you determine tone online? How can you understand what degree of irony or sincerity is being expressed in a given statement? How can you tell what to expect or how to interact with a given person or group of people online? This is why I am interested in people whose avatars on Twitter are stills from Japanese cartoons.
Of course anime avatars are now more strongly identified with Gamergate and its various surrounding reactionary communities, a group no less weird (by the standards of mainstream meatspace American politics), but much larger and, frankly, scarier.
(The association between anime avatars and Gamergate is helped in part because Gamergate’s logo-slash-mascot is a green-and-purple cartoon woman named Vivian James who tends to be drawn in an anime style. Yes: a fictional cartoon woman is the symbol of a movement accused of unrealistic views of women.)
But why anime avatars? What do Gamergaters have in common with Twitter Stalinists? As noted above, in some ways anime avatars are the equivalent of a fedora or a leather duster or transition lenses, a quick public signal of someone’s (proud) nerdom. If egg avatars are signs of Twitter, and likely internet, novices, anime avatars would seem to be the opposite: the signs of people who have spent, or are spending, too much time online.
This kind of too-much-time-online nerdiness seems to be correlated in turn — and I’m just speculating here; I have no data — with an outgrowth of new, weird, fascinating kinds of outside-the-mainstream or extreme politics, like effusive 21st-century Titoism. Or like Gamergate. (Many of these political communities seem deeply focused on ideological purity and membership requirements, which, well, draw your own conclusions.) And because the anime avatars are tweeting and chatting and posting on message boards and Tumblr and Reddit more than anyone else, they are, unlike egg avatars, actually driving political conversations. Not fully into the mainstream, yet. But in a way that legacy publications have already been forced to confront, and that actual policymakers will be forced to manage.
So for practical purposes, if you are besieged by trolls and are also okay with blocking people who might be extremely intelligent and engaging and also fervent otaku, all you need to know is that the “anime avatar” is a mostly though not entirely reliable indicator of trolldom, and block anyone you see with one. But I would suggest you not. Blocking egg avatars makes sense to me: They generally represent a type and a politics you are familiar with. They’re essentially talk-radio listeners and racist uncles, only online. There are no familiar IRL equivalents to anime avatars. Yet.
Twitter is a large and public and very flat social network, by which I mean it’s easy to communicate with anyone and difficult to determine quickly whether that person is a good-faith interlocutor or a time-wasting troll. So frequent users (and frequently trolled or harassed users) generally need to come up with quick, one-look tests. One time-tested method for settling the question is to look at the person’s avatar: If it’s the default white egg, ignore, or block.
The idea, I think, is that someone with an egg avatar is either too stupid to figure out how to change it, in which case block, or so new to Twitter that he or she is unfamiliar with the customs or niceties of interactions, in which case block. (“A person with under 10 followers and an egg avatar is the absolute quickest to hop in your mentions on some bs,” as podcast host and comedian @desusnice puts it.) (One day when Twitter avatars suddenly failed, everyone briefly became an egg, a bacchanalia lovingly celebrated by the Tumblr “everyone is an egg.”)
So “egg avatar” is shorthand sometimes for “dumb” and sometimes for “new” and always for “not worth bothering with.” But it is not the only avatar category that has certain stereotypes attached to it. There’s the eagle avatar (sometimes crying), which, well, I imagine you can guess what that person is interested in. And the South Park–character avatar, which I associate with people who want to argue about libertarianism.
And then there’s the anime avatar. Here’s Boing Boing’s Rob Beschizza last year, in the thick of Gamergate:
He also shared his pizza with some members of the train crew. Great job!
The next day, he did it all over again.
As a general rule, don’t buy food on trains. It’s a ripoff. But if you forget to think ahead, then the train’s snack bar is your only option. And if your train doesn’t have a snack bar? Well, you’re shit outta luck. Unless …
Over the weekend, an enterprising British DJ by the name of Artwork found himself trapped on a five-hour rail ride without food. So he did what everyone would do in this situation: He coordinated pizza delivery with an upcoming station stop.
He chronicled it live on Twitter.
When a bot like Poncho is acting sluggish or unresponsive, that’s not a product of Facebook’s platform, that’s a result of lackluster third-party implementation. Bots are not an A-B conversation with a server in Palo Alto. They’re more like an A-B-C-D-E-F-G conversation between a handful of web locations. When you ask for a news update from CNN, for example, you send a message, which goes to Facebook, which goes to CNN, which processes it, determines a response, maybe queries additional servers to gather more data to include in the response, then sends it back to Facebook, which sends it back to you. Duh, simple.
Even Facebook can’t explain why bots are slow right now, because they’re acting as a go-between. Speaking with the Verge, Messenger head David Marcus said, “[Latency] should be less than five seconds. We picked Poncho because we like the thing, because it’s a really cool experience. But maybe their server’s just slammed with people trying the weather cat. I have no idea what’s actually happening, but I’m assuming that might be the case.” (Emphasis added.) There are yet-unknown infrastructure challenges related to this emerging format.
On top of that general complexity, it should be noted explicitly: Natural language processing (NLP) is hard. Tokenizing statements (breaking them into pieces to be analyzed) and deriving instruction is not an easy task for systems designed to follow a specific set of instructions. The workload required for effective NLP might also explain why Facebook is making its AI toolsets available to developers.
The shaky bot rollout points to a large and growing tension with Facebook (insomuch as Facebook, the market leader by a country mile, feels tension). As they transition from a portal into their own content platform, they’re turning over important aspects of the service to third parties. That means we might get stuck with glitchy bots on a technical level, or crappy articles and video on the Instant Articles and Live platforms, respectively. For all of its internal technical prowess, Facebook can’t tightly control how developers and content makers use of its system. In short, the company is placing its spotless reputation for stability in the hands of millions of third-party providers, many of them amateur or less focused on the Facebook experience than, well, Facebook itself.
All of this is to say that bots are new and they’re not made by Facebook. They’re made by coders and engineers who might just be as unfamiliar with the conversational UI paradigm as you or I. They suck now, and I have no doubt that they’ll get better. But that’s always been the case with technology.
Last week, Facebook launched its new bot platform — a system built inside its Messenger app that lets users interact and speak with automated programs. The bots can relay the news, report the weather, and sell you stuff, among other things. They are, for multiple large tech companies, the next big trend in personal computing.
And as of right now, they’re pretty sucky.
This has been reported regularly since the bots rolled out last week. The Verge called Facebook bots “the slowest way to use the internet,” criticizing the Wall Street Journal’s bot for its minutes-long latency (a valid criticism; minutes are crazy-long in an industry that measures itself in milliseconds).
Evaluating Poncho, a weather bot, Gizmodo criticized it for being unable to parse conversation that was, in human terms, relatively simple.
The issues come with the territory, but they’re made all the more frustrating because of Facebook’s near-spotless reputation when it comes to technical implementation. Facebook almost never goes offline, and each new product it introduces (live video, most recently) generally works without a hitch. Facebook has been able to capture users, attention, and advertisers by having an extremely reliable stack.
So when bots don’t function as anticipated, it might be because we are conflating “Facebook bots” with “Facebook’s bots.” Bots like Poncho’s and the Wall Street Journal’s run on Facebook’s platform, but are not engineered or maintained by Facebook; they’re third-party.
This might be obvious, but again, when you’re using a first-party Facebook service, the glitches and frustrations seem less forgivable. This used to be flipped: you’d go to a third-party site and log in with Facebook. Now, you go to Facebook and use it to message third-party sites.

It should go without saying that The Daily Mail is the best website on the internet, not just for its unapologetically heinous design but for flamboyant tabloid writing that goes from zero to a hundred in under fifty words. “Revealed: Babysitter, 21, charged with abducting two-year-old girl from her bed in the middle of the night was a private-school educated college-dropout who got engaged just weeks ago” is an entirely different story from the beginning of its headline to its end, and when these bad boys get blown up in blue typeface dead-center of The Daily Mail’s homepage, each story becomes the web’s purest siren song. Resisting clicking on a Daily Mail link is harder than pretending you don’t google yourself.
Most would assume that the Daily Mail’s feature stories are the hearty main course, and its often incomprehensible sidebar content is the pillowy meringue on a disgusting Baked Alaska. But the sidebar of The Daily Mail is full of hits, hits that are only made more enjoyable by the subheads that appear beneath their verbose headlines. “They could be sisters! Meryl Streep, 66, and lookalike daughter Mamie, 32, coordinate in warming coats at charity luncheon in NYC” is followed up with “Hasn’t fallen far from tree.” Taken out of context, “hasn’t fallen far from tree” is delightful poetic chum. “Rihanna shows some leg in tiny denim hot pants teamed with a fluffy pink coat as she arrives at Travis Scott’s hotel” is preposterously punctuated by “Diamonds singer.”
A subhead on a news story is intended to fill in the blanks that its headline can’t cover. But when has anything the Daily Mail done made sense? When presented without context, a day’s worth of subheads featured on Daily Mail sidebar stories makes for very gratifying poetry indeed. Story about tabloid website.

Ever been worried that you might accidentally hire or interact with a “social-justice warrior”? SJWs, as they’re known to the free-speech warriors of gaming message boards, look and often act like anyone else — until they start screaming about lesbian rights in the middle of a meeting. Luckily for those concerned, there’s now a list of known SJWs. Because, generally, making lists of people based on their political and social alignments has worked out well in the past.
On Saturday, the far-right writer Vox Day (“The Jews in Europe are doomed because they spent the last 70 years undermining European nationalism and supporting the transformation of European population demographics”) noted in a blog post that it would be useful to create a list of known SJWs, or social-justice warriors.
And now, voilà, such a list has materialized in the form of a helpful wiki that Day himself likely created (it links to his book, SJWs Always Lie, as well as to his original post). The author cutely implies that the list should be used by SJWs to hire like-minded folk.
I’ve interacted online with many people who fly the anti-SJW flag, including plenty of GamerGaters. They’ll tell you that they didn’t start this fight — it was brought to them by SJWs invading their cultural spaces. These anti-SJWs, of course, have no political agenda of their own: Their views are common sense, and by definition apolitical. They simply want SJWs to stop trying to make everything about wacky far-left politics. Anti-SJWs are for free speech and, unlike SJWs, righteously opposed to the idea of lobbying to get people with unpopular views fired (well, sometimes). They are also sick of how SJWs are constantly trying to launch online shaming campaigns, which they, the anti-SJWs, are opposed to (well, sometimes).
Anyway. Creating an enemies list composed almost entirely of progressive and feminist voices seems like a really smart way to express these sentiments and show the world just how reasonable and commonsensical and apolitical anti-SJWs are.
My social-media feed is often flooded with “virtual hugs,” “high fives,” unasked-for encouragement, cheering-on, and other variations on “you’re a badass female character.” People RT this article without reading it, because they trust me, and because they want to make me happy. Despite the trials of being a visible woman in a complicated field, I am actually pretty confident in myself, thanks, and it troubles me to be treated as a pal who needs a lot of slaps on the back from strangers. I’d like readers who respect my opinion, not wannabe friends who are seeking my acknowledgment or validation. But that’s just how things are nowadays. I am not special. I could be anyone. I’d prefer to make money because my work is good, not because people believe I need help or cheering-on, but I’ll take the money where it comes. Per-word rates are not what they used to be. Actually, I can’t remember the last time I was offered a per-word rate.
I had a “birthday sale” on my digital store recently. I was not above it. “It’s like you’re buying me a drink,” I told Twitter coyly. I did pretty well that day.
Pretending at closeness is really the only way forward for anyone who wants to make money on the internet. As such, watch as organizations pretend, with increasing intensity, that they are individuals. Start counting how many times platforms, services, and websites entreat you in human voices, with awkward humor, for money. Watch as the things we expect to be invisible, utilitarian, start oozing emojis and winky-smileys. Even Silicon Valley, global epicenter of whitewashed empathy voids and one percenter sci-fi wank fantasies, is going to pretend it cares about you. Especially Silicon Valley. Ugh.
Your inbox is going to fill up with requests for professional favors from strangers who tell you they love you. They are not remotely your peers, but they’ll expect you to work for them anyway for exposure, for credit, for kudos, for “the community.” They add emojis for effect, too. Your feelings are now professional currency. Everyone who makes anything digital is monitoring the exchange rate to survive. Every content creator is now a community manager.
You live in a network of friends, likes, favorites, hearts, and stars. The future is not a prison of robot overlords, but a Lucky Charms hell world stuffed with “plushies” you backed on Kickstarter. Tell Your Story, Medium begs me in the field where I post this article. Please like and share this article. Please Tweet at me to tell me I kick ass.

Lately Facebook is getting a little too intimate with me. “Good morning, Leigh,” it coos. “Thanks for being here. We hope you enjoy Facebook today.” Then, like a slice of dystopian cafeteria lunch, it serves one of its abysmal “memories” into my feed, some forgotten years-old share, and when I tell it I don’t want to see that, Facebook scrapes apologetically: “We know we don’t always get it right.”
No, Facebook, of course you don’t. Remember how you started serving me wedding ads when I’d only just told one or two people I was engaged? That was creepy. Facebook is absolutely, indisputably creepy, a fungal colony of privacy violations fused helplessly to our human infrastructure. It spies on its employees and it demands pictures of our ID so it can regulate our names.
Everybody knows Facebook is creepy. Nonetheless, all this time it never occurred to me to delete my account until it began doing this: trying to act like a person. Pretending we are on a first-name basis.
We often imagine the inevitable future tech dystopia will be cold, populations marching under the eye of sterile robot overlords, our speech monitored and scrubbed of sentiment and intonation. Increasingly, though, it seems like we’re hurtling toward the opposite: a singularity of smarm, where performative — maybe even excessive — intimacy is the order of the day.
Of course we don’t want creeper spy colony Facebook to be our friend. But creating the impression of intimacy is becoming increasingly crucial to the content economy today, and it’s happening everywhere. As the bottom plummets out of the advertising model and the “stuff Facebook with clickbait” approach begins to run out of rope, content creators — comedians, storytellers, critics, journalists — are striking out on their own and funding their work through alternative means, from crowdfunding to patronage and subscriptions.
In general, people seem more likely to pay for content when it’s “voiced.” In the era of YouTube stars, we expect to see faces. We want eye contact. Supermodels are born on Instagram, their reach and brand equity driven by passionate followers who “like” everything Cara Delevingne posts that she is doing. Examples of intimacy’s high valuation are everywhere, from Taylor Swift’s constant passel of best-best friends to Kim Kardashian pretending her daughter North “accidentally” posted a bikini selfie of Mom. She’s just like us! Anyone you admire starts to feel available to you via social media, and the more they cultivate that impression of a relationship, the better you, as a consumer, will perform.
Importantly, though, it’s not just celebrities who participate in the intimacy valuation market. My colleagues in the video-games biz have developed their own subscription channels and platforms where they now make more money per video appealing directly to their fans than they would working for a traditional platform. Traditional channels cannot afford them. I’ve self-published books and stories directly to my readership that earned definitively more money than they would have through any traditional channel (assuming traditional channels would have even wanted them). We are all well aware that people are spending money because they like us, or some idea of us; they are spending in part because of the idea that they are engaged in a parasocial relationship with us.
We believe that on some level these relationships develop organically, and that they involve a component of sincerity. When I was targeted by an online hate group last year, sales of my little digital book — a relatively niche product, some personal writing related to a single video-game conference — rocketed. Certainly it’s possible that the increased visibility caused by the episode naturally brought more interest in my work, but I think it’s more likely that by spending money on me, people felt they were fighting evil. It wasn’t entirely that they respected my writing or my opinion; they wanted to cheer on a public personality that they felt close to.
The exasperated London Fire Brigade was once again forced to issue its warning on Twitter:
Sometimes you hack life, and sometimes life hacks you.
Nearly a year ago, in the Guardian, celebrity chef and food lecturer Jamie Oliver published a nifty tip for making toast, that “wonderful, humble food”: “In the past,” he wrote, “I have turned the toaster on its side, put cheese on bread and slid it in so it toasts on one side and melts on the other. It’s a bit of a jiggle but it works.”
It does work, if your goal is to nearly burn down your apartment. The Guardian quickly added a warning about the sideways toaster trick after learning that the London Fire Brigade had put out a cheesy-toast fire the year before.
But in spite of the Guardian’s strong non-recommendation and a handful of grievously failed attempts, the trick, which existed long before Oliver pointed it out, continues to set kitchens ablaze after spreading on Facebook as a #lifehack.
Suzanne Dale of Manchester, U.K., is the latest unfortunate soul to spark off a bread-and-cheese inferno while trying to save a little time last week.
According to the Manchester Evening News, Dale escaped disaster by throwing the blazing toaster out the window and into her garden.
“DON’T TRY THIS AT HOME… !!!” she shouted on Facebook, noting that she saw the trick on Facebook. “PLEASE SHARE.. !!… there must be other people as daft as me.. !!”
Back in May, comedian Louis Virtel wrote proudly about how he’d pulled off the gayest move in the history of Jeopardy!, an emphatic snap after he nailed a crucial Daily Double. His only regret about his appearance on the show was that, despite the obvious signaling in the snap heard ‘round the world, he didn’t explicitly say “I’m gay” on TV. If he had, maybe the bumbling GOP wouldn’t have used Virtel’s moment of triumph as part of a promotion for its State of the Union responses.
The party whose attitude toward gay people and their rights is unfriendly at best and openly hostile at worst decided to respond to President Obama via Snapchat in something they called “Snap of the Union.” And right there on GOP.gov, promoting the Republican Snapchat account, was a GIF of Virtel’s famous moment. The irony was rich and thick, and Virtel picked up on it immediately.
In a post on Hitfix Tuesday night, he explained why the Republican party appropriating his image was both stupid and ineffective:
“The fact that the GOP can’t detect gay pride in arguably the gayest Jeopardy! moment of all time is proof of their brutal ignorance,” he wrote. “There is nothing sassy or cute about the GOP invoking my image to prove they’re hip with the kids, who almost unanimously think they’re a joke anyway. The GOP’s aggressive, antigay hysteria fills me with contempt, and this is just another laughably moronic mistake to consider alongside their regressive legacy.”
Ohhhh, snap!
Despite Virtel’s objections in his essay and on Twitter, the Jeopardy! GIF remains up on GOP.gov.
Modders got more ambitious for Morrowind’s sequel, Oblivion, which was released in 2006. The fifth-most-popular Oblivion mod on Nexus Mods, and the first that isn’t a bug fix or UI tweak, is called Hentai Gentlemen’s EyeCandy Body, uploaded in 2008 and last updated in August 2014. It has many customization options.
This sort of pattern for altering the digital female body repeats for every subsequent Bethesda game. Regarding Fallout 3, one mod user was looking for “Smoth skin no flaws on face.” (“Is there a mod that makes your toon like a glamour toon, no flaws in skin tone looking like she just stepped out of a glamour studio?”) The rest of the thread features users discussing the best mods and technical solutions for clean skin.
In 2011, the fifth Elder Scrolls game, Skyrim, hit shelves, and the female mods followed suit. Take as an example this 2013 Steam forum thread, “hey where do i find a mod for smooth skin for skyrim.”
The questioner is quickly pointed in the direction of CBBE, or Caliente’s Beautiful Bodies Edition, which “replaces the vanilla female body that all adult female characters … share, with one that is fully customisable with the BodySlide tool and BodySlide’s RaceMenu Morphs plugin. By default there are three nude options available that don’t require anything but installation, as well as three underwear styles for these body shapes.”
There is also a “Human Female Clean Face” mod for Skyrim.
This is clearly a persistent trend within the modding community. Which brings us to Fallout 4, already being supplied with body mods. Aside from the aforementioned “Simple Clean Face for Woman,” there’s the “Muscular Female Mod,” which “replaces the standard female body normal map with one with more muscle detail.” Another mod adds more female underwear options for players who want to let their character roam around naked.
Ranked third on Nexus Mods’ list of the top Fallout 4 mods is the “Glorious Female Nude Mod,” which “with Ultra High resolution textures … might be one of the most impressive nude mods so far.” It has been downloaded 111,353 times. A search for male nudes turned up nothing. Well, not nothing; it returned seven different mods for nude women.
Fallout 4, the newest blockbuster role-playing video game, came out last week. You may already know this, since the game has been the subject of a pretty heavy media blitz before launch. You may already own it: Bethesda Softworks, the game’s publisher, announced that they had shipped 12 million units of the game “representing sales in excess of $750 million” (shipping, it should be noted, is a different metric from sold).
So, a lot of people have this game. While some play on console systems like the Xbox and PlayStation, many are playing it on PC, because that version offers mod support. Mods (short for “modification”) allow players to tweak the game, from things as minor as interface tweaks to more substantial additions like new characters and locales. Mods are popular enough to sustain substantial online communities, and when it comes to modding communities, there are few that can rival the one for Bethesda games.
Given that Fallout 4 is only a week old, many of these mods are simple cosmetic upgrades — higher-quality 3-D models and textures, color swaps, a Taylor Swift background for the playable character’s wearable computer. Last week, a mod for the Boston-set Fallout 4 earned the ire of Major League Baseball because it featured David Ortiz and Red Sox paraphernalia.
I’m personally bewildered, and creeped out, by the clean mods.
Bethesda’s two major RPG franchises are the Elder Scrolls (medieval fantasy) and Fallout (nuclear post-apocalypse). In both cases, the characters in these games are generally hard-scrabble and grimy. And that’s when some of the mods get … weirder. Take, for instance, “Simple clean face for woman,” a mod whose sole purpose is to remove dirt smudges and skin texture from only the game’s female characters, leaving them with an inhuman, artificial smoothness.
“Simple clean face for woman” is just the latest in a long lineage of mods designed to alter the female characters in Bethesda games. There are male-centric and gender-neutral additions as well, but they appear with noticeably less frequency. Here is where I state the obvious: These mods are created by users and distributed via third-party sites like Nexus Mods. They are in no way endorsed or monitored by the game’s creators. It should also be noted that because these are role-playing games, players can assume the role of a female character and alter their own appearance. The utility of these mods is, in a vacuum, not entirely scopophilic.
Body-modding in Bethesda games started off innocent enough. The company’s 2002 hit, the Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, spawned a mod called Better Bodies, which sought “to make a body mod that a modder could easily make clothing for, and that also looked more realistic than the models that come with the game.” It also added character models with genitalia. More than 13 years after Morrowind’s release, Better Bodies is the third-most-popular mod for the game on Nexus Mods, coming in behind a bug patch and a general graphics overhaul.
I guess it’s true what they say: It’s completely impossible to get rid of the stuff.
A number of armed militants, terrorists, or dumbass jamokes (depending on your perspective) have occupied a little-used federal building in Oregon, and reactions have ranged from outrage at the racial component to the way the government deals with people with guns (see: the liberal internet) to cautiously doing nothing (the FBI). Reddit, the internet’s unofficial id, has its own very special reaction: It wants to glitter-bomb the militia.
Last week, the militants posted a shipping address online, calling on supporters to mail them supplies as they prepare to hunker down for a standoff with the government that may never come. Armed with that address, redditors decided to mail something else: glitter, known far and wide as the herpes of craft supplies.
A Reddit thread about the call for supplies inspired all kinds of prank suggestions — from penis-shaped gummies to hummus — but glitter-bombing was the most popular. Some posters claimed they’d already mailed some:
The prank seems directly inspired by Ship Your Enemies Glitter, a website briefly popular in early 2015 that did exactly what its name promised. It turned out to be a quick-sale scheme, and the owner flipped it for $85,000 after ginning up controversy by begging people to stop paying him to mail out glitter-bombs.
The glitter craze was followed shortly by a glitter backlash, as the internet’s Hot Take cycle dictates, and then rapidly twinkled away to nothing. But now, thanks to the sons of obstinate rancher and Second Amendment man Cliven Bundy, it appears glitter-bombing is back. Yay?
This certainly puts yesterday’s Facebook Live press-release bonanza in greater perspective. According to the Information, Facebook is experiencing a substantial decline in the number of personal posts that users make on the network. “Personal posts,” in this context, means updates like announcements about engagements, or new jobs — posts lumped into a group known as “original broadcast sharing,” as distinct from links out to other websites or content.
From the Information:
The result is partially a product of Facebook’s growth. As it has asked users to expand their friends lists, it’s also tasked them with navigating, in their status updates, the many different social circles to which those friends might belong. In other words, your friends from high school, college, work, and elsewhere, don’t all care about the same things, and managing that on a single network can be exhausting.
The company has rolled out a few changes as a result. Those “On This Day” and holiday pop-ups at the top of the news feed are two such examples. The news feed’s sorting process has also been tweaked to boost original sharing more prominently. (People have caught wind of this change — posting keywords like “Congratulations!” or “Exciting news!” appears to enhance reach.)
Facebook’s anxiety about this drop in original sharing — which is the type that users engage with most often — helps explain yesterday’s announcements about Facebook’s livestreaming service: Live video is, for now, a novel way for people to share with their friends.
The “live” aspect also makes it seem temporary, like Snapchat, which I’d wager is part of the appeal. A few years ago, when Facebook rolled out the activity log and made it easier to see every single comment made, and action taken on, the service, it made people more aware of how much data Facebook was really logging. And they’re logging a lot about their users.
In response to the Information’s report, Facebook simply said, “People continue to share a ton on Facebook; the overall level of sharing has remained not only strong, but similar to levels in prior years.” Strong rebuttal.
In case the dozens of heartwarming stories and weird news clogging your Facebook feed weren’t enough indication, so-called “viral” news is a big business despite the fact that, on a not-infrequent basis, these stories are proven false. Last August, BuzzFeed investigated Central European News — “one of the Western media’s primary sources of tantalising and attention-grabbing stories” — in an article titled “The King of Bullshit News,” in which they concluded that many of the agency’s articles were entirely or partially fake.
Among the stories deemed fake were ones about lonely Chinese teenagers walking cabbages, a Russian fisherman saved from a bear attack by a Justin Bieber ringtone, and a man who chopped off his own penis after being told it was too small.
Now CEN and its head, Michael Leidig, are suing BuzzFeed in federal court, seeking damages of more than $11 million, claiming false and defamatory allegations. The lawsuit further argues that CEN’s and Leidig’s reputation has been damaged, citing the fact that BuzzFeed’s article is one of the first results when Googling the news agency.
“Many clients of plaintiff CEN simply stopped using its news service with no inquiry about whether the charges in defendant’s publication were true or false,” the suit states. BuzzFeed itself has written stories citing CEN reporting in the past, but following the publication of “The King of Bullshit News,” they went back and added editorial notes to those stories.
The suit also includes a particularly morbid note about Leidig’s 50th birthday.
Reached for comment, Peter Heneghan, BuzzFeed’s European head of communications, said, “We’re aware that the suit was filed, but we don’t comment on potential litigation.”
How long was he in there? “About 1 hour and 20 minutes.” Did he learn anything from the experience? “I’m not getting comfortable on ANYONES couch, so this experience won’t repeat itself.” He even gave a detailed explanation of how he ended up inside the couch:
But, most important, he gave advice on what to do if you ever live this nightmare. Read carefully, because this hack could save your life.
Six months ago, one man lived the nightmare that we all hold in the back of our minds: What if you fell into a fold-out couch and couldn’t get out?
Last July, this waking nightmare finally caught up with Dank, a poster on the message board the Coli ("The Premier Sports, Hip Hop, & Urban Lifestyle Forum on the Internet") who became lodged in the furniture without his cell phone. (Standard story-from-the-internet disclaimer: This is a story from the internet. Not just from the internet, but from a message board. So take it with a grain of salt.)
Out brave hero did what anyone would do in that situation: He took out his (Wi-Fi-enabled) iPod and posted to his favorite forum:
He even provided a photo for proof and, as any dutiful board member would, live-posted throughout his ordeal, despite low battery life:
He was eventually rescued by his friend’s mom and stuck around to answer questions:
France’s national police force, the Gendarmerie nationale, has issued a strongly worded Facebook post imploring parents around France to stop posting pictures of their children online. “You can all be proud moms and dads to your magnificent children, but be careful,” someone, presumably a police officer, wrote (charmingly literal translation via Facebook). “We remind you that posting photos of your kids to Facebook is not without danger!”
The initiative was launched by the police in response to the “Motherhood Challenge,” an awful Facebook thing that trivializes actual challenges of motherhood in favor of posting generic pictures of mother and child smiling. The French seem to be most concerned with the privacy of children whose pictures mothers are plastering their photos all over Facebook; a French internet law expert told center-right newspaper Le Figaro that, since French law prohibits taking and publishing pictures of anyone without their consent (including children), it’s not too hard to foresee a future in which aging French parents are jailed and fined for posting pictures of their children, should those children later object.
Another, unspoken aspect of this seemingly strange statement from the French police could be the fact that everyone hates seeing pictures of other peoples’ children on Facebook. Le Figaro summed it up quite nicely when they referred to a friend’s child being born as “D-Day.” The French are, as usual, far ahead of us on the front of barring parents from spamming us with posts about their awful children. I call on the FBI, which is almost like the Gendarmerie nationale, to issue a similar warning and prevent me from ever seeing a picture of a child I don’t know ever again.
Over the weekend, a number of Facebook pages for so-called white student unions began cropping up, with more than 20 universities tied to supposed student groups claiming to celebrate white culture.
As was pointed out by Bears for Equality, however, the groups are likely an astroturfing campaign carried out by white supremacists. Last Wednesday, a page for a white student union at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign was shut down, drawing the attention of Andrew Anglin, a neo-Nazi who blogs for the Daily Stormer, a notorious and virulently racist and anti-Semitic publication. In a post about the controversy, Anglin directed readers to set up more Facebook pages.
And that’s how you end up with 25 or so pages for white student unions at universities like Rutgers and NYU. In an interview, the admin for the NYU page, a proud and outspoken advocate for white people, declined to identify themselves.
The now-defunct page for Penn State’s white student union posted a status at one point proclaiming that the group was united with other WSU’s under the NAESA. It’s unclear what NAESA actually stands for, though it’s probably not the National Association of Elevator Safety Authorities. Still, the posting indicates that whoever was establishing these pages was either coordinating with others or setting up every account on their own.
Many of them even share the same filler text about European ancestry, proclaiming, in part, “We unapologetically provide a safe space for white students to air their true feelings about the future of our nation, discuss and reflect on the lessons laid down for us by our great European writers, philosophers, and artists, and develop a positive program to restore the pioneering will and greatness of our unique and virtuous people.”
The moral of the story: College students are not-quite-adults who often make careless decisions. Creating a nationwide network of white student unions probably isn’t one of them.
Still, as Bear for Equality writes, the best recourse is to report white-student-union pages to university administrations who might act to protect their trademark. The other point is to not engage with trolls; these aren’t people looking for spirited, rational debate.
Earlier today, an avid Donald Trump supporter who’s spent several days tweeting pro-Trump videos at Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton, and the official GOP account, learned an important lesson: the “Establishment” does not have a Twitter account. Yes, those elite D.C. politicians — maybe including Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Ted Cruz, depending on whom you ask — and Wall Street banker billionaires do not share a Twitter; @Estblshmnt actually belongs to a feminist magazine.
Live and learn, and credit for the graceful apology. For those curious, however, here’s a handy list of U.S. senators on Twitter.
This is the second such incident this month: Two weeks ago, Sikh actor and designer Waris Ahluwalia, who’s appeared in three Wes Anderson movies and a Gap campaign, was prevented from flying from Mexico City to New York by airline employees after refusing to remove his turban. The Sikh turban, called a dastaar, is an integral part of the religion, and cannot be removed in public. “When a Sikh man or woman dons a turban, the turban ceases to be just a piece of cloth and becomes one and the same with the Sikh’s head,” according to the website of the Sikh Coalition, an advocacy group.
Vine star Jasmeet Singh, a Canadian Sikh who performs as Jus Reign, was forced to remove his turban by TSA agents at San Francisco International Airport — a humiliating experience he related in a series of tweets in which he called out the TSA for its xenophobia.
Singh, who has more than a million followers on Vine, is likely among the most well-known Sikh men in North America. Many of his most famous videos skewer Western interpretations of people of color and their culture, like “Brown People Try White People Food,” a response to BuzzFeed’s ubiquitous “White People [do something mildly out of their comfort zone]” videos.
But being a charming and popular presence on Vine isn’t quite enough to avoid TSA suspicions:
His legacy is being revised, with some calling for a return to the policies Stalin implemented to “bring order” to Russia. Cultural institutions are celebrating him, and his poll numbers are up.
So, that’s one theory, as sideways as it sounds: Through the lens of history, millennial Russian selfie-takers might actually view Stalin as … cool?
Here’s another, maybe more plausible: It’s that mustache. Stalin may have killed millions as he forced the Soviet Union through industrialization, but his contribution to the digital age is one funny-ass face.
Try putting it on. It’s shocking at first, but seconds later, you just have to laugh. Sure, this futuristic facial-recognition app could be celebrating the merciless past, but it’s more likely it’s just laughing at it.
Russia’s hottest new selfie video app, MSQRD (pronounced “masquerade”), has taken Instagram by storm this year, the Moscow Times reports. The app lets you put on all kinds of virtual “masks” and watch them move as you move your face. There are bunny ears, exaggerated tears, KISS makeup, and the faces of a tiger, bear, or gorilla. And, strangest and best of all, there’s Joseph Stalin.
And the Stalin mask isn’t just an option in MSQRD — it’s the default option. The first time you start up the app, you’ll see the mustachioed face of a brutal Soviet dictator staring back at you. It’s both jarring and strangely hilarious, and Russian Instagrammers love it.
But what’s the source of the Stalingram’s appeal? Its absurdity is an obvious selling point, and there’s got to be some ironic appreciation in the mix, too. But the Moscow Times, while offering a wag of the finger to those who think “it’s fun to turn themselves into a dictator whose reign saw millions of people persecuted, imprisoned, tortured and killed,” suggests that attitudes toward Stalin have softened in Russia over the 60 years since his death.
On Twitter Wednesday, internet grammarians attempted to settle what is apparently an age-old debate — is the notification you get when someone reads your email or text message pronounced “red” receipt or “reed” receipt? Is it intended to be past tense, or present?
And it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay; Then said they unto him, Say now “read receipt”: and he said “red receipt”: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.
I was not aware that this was even a debate — obviously, the answer is past tense. A read receipt indicates that someone has “red” your message. Does the other option make even a single iota of sense?
Apparently, it does. Mic editorial director Cooper Fleishman put a poll on Twitter to resolve this very important question, and with a sample size of 150 voters thus far, past tense holds only a slim lead — 42 percent to 40. (The remaining voters indicated they had no idea what Fleishman was talking about.)
The intractable reed/red controversy has been around since at least 2010, and it doesn’t appear to be going away anytime soon. It’s gotten so desperate that reasonable people are asking Nicki Minaj to issue a final ruling on the issue before it tears the internet apart at the seams:
We haven’t seen a pronunciation squabble this contentious since the GIF/JIF wars of ‘13.
As humans, we spend every waking moment contemplating our death. Death is, after all, the great uniter. Some of us will go to heaven, some of us will go to hell, a select few souls will linger forever in Purgatory, where time has no beginning and no end.
As we await our inevitable return to the earth from whence we came, so does San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit, which got very dark on Twitter last night. Running the BART’s Twitter account has become a thankless role in recent years, as the city’s explosive tech boom has pushed the public transit rail system to capacity.
BART calmly (stoically?) explained that, among other issues, the system needs to replace 90 miles of rail. They also said that publicly funding BART is a far more complex issue than funding, say, Shmorplr, which is Uber for hyperlocal dog Groupons. Still, the agency did share that they were working on large-scale overhauls for the system.
In case this entire thread has been bumming you out, the department did clarify that they were not resigned to their fate, telling one rider, “No despair! We are moving forward and finding ways to fund our future needs.”
What this mainly boils down to is that Twitter, while great for light chatter, is maybe not the best platform for robust civic engagement.
So, to Guido, it’s technically possible to do what the FBI wants here:
“On the iPhone 5C, the passcode delay and device erasure are implemented in software and Apple can add support for peripheral devices that facilitate PIN code entry,” he writes. “In order to limit the risk of abuse, Apple can lock the customized version of iOS to only work on the specific recovered iPhone and perform all recovery on their own, without sharing the firmware image with the FBI.”
Forensic scientist Jonathan Zdziarski agrees it should be doable “on a technical level,” noting that Apple has firmware signing capabilities for all its devices, making Apple employees the only people who can get a locked phone to accept new software.
It’s also possible that whatever method Apple uses won’t work on the latest phones — the 5S and up — with the Secure Enclave. Can Apple modify that Secure Enclave? Probably, according to John Kelley, an InfoSec expert at Square. It just doesn’t appear that they’d have any incentive to do so when they’re only being asked to help break into a 5C.
But no matter what measures Apple takes to make sure the custom software only works on Farook’s phone, the company will still have built a back door into iOS devices. Helping the FBI in this case will confirm that disabling the iPhone’s limit on password guesses is possible and create the potential that it could be repeated by malicious hackers (or, more likely, that the government could order Apple to repeat the process on other devices in evidence).
Those are just the consequences of installing new software on the phone. There’s also the question of how the FBI can access the device after that happens. The two options laid out in the court order both seem risky: Apple can bring the software to the FBI and let them try to crack the password, or Apple can take the phone to one of its facilities, then let the FBI try to crack it remotely.
Even if the FBI never handles the firmware file itself, and lets Apple do everything except the brute-force password entry, the company would be forced into creating a system that could be used again.
“Part of the court order also instructed Apple to essentially design a system by which pins could be sent electronically to the device, allowing for rapid brute forcing while still giving Apple plausible deniability that they hacked a customer device in a literal sense,” as Zdziarski wrote.
Cook seems to share all of these concerns, but without admitting to the possibility that Apple could theoretically build a hack with this phone only. In his open letter, he wrote, “[M]ake no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.”
There may be a way to limit its use, but that doesn’t undermine Cook’s larger point: that if Apple doesn’t take a stand in this case, they could be forced to build “limited” back doors again and again, targeting any number of devices.
This week, a federal judge ordered Apple to assist the FBI in unlocking the iPhone of Syed Farook, one of the shooters who opened fire at a party in San Bernardino last December. The court order calls for a narrow tool that would only work on Farook’s iPhone, but Apple CEO Tim Cook declined on Tuesday in a strongly worded letter, arguing that such a narrow tool doesn’t exist and would be “too dangerous to create,” essentially opening a back door into every iPhone. Cook makes a very strong case that Apple shouldn’t be forced to hack the phone, but is the company bullshitting a little bit when it says opening one phone is equivalent to opening them all?
“No reasonable person,” Cook wrote, “would find that acceptable.”
What Apple is specifically being asked to do is disable an iPhone security feature that erases a phone after ten incorrect password guesses. That would allow the FBI to “brute-force” their way into the phone by entering passwords at a rate of 12 per second until they find the right one.
According to Cook, Apple can’t simply turn off the feature. The company hasn’t written code that would bypass the password safeguard, because that code would be extremely dangerous in the wrong hands. Turned over to the FBI, it would allow the agency to unlock any iPhone it could physically seize.
“While the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control,” Cook wrote.
But the court order suggests a way to bypass the password limit on Farook’s phone only: by creating “a signed iPhone software file” that “will be coded by Apple with a unique identifier of the phone so that the [software] would only load and execute on the SUBJECT DEVICE.”
A very limited hack, only workable on one phone, is certainly nice to talk about, but is it actually within Apple’s technical capabilities?
According to Dan Guido at the Trail of Bits Blog, it is. Guido writes that Farook’s iPhone 5C doesn’t have the modern security measures Apple introduced along with TouchID — the feature that lets you unlock your phone with a fingerprint. Newer phones have a “Secure Enclave,” a separate computer that handles password security; installing a custom version of the operating system wouldn’t get around that.
But in the 5C, the operating system handles all the password functions, and the operating system could theoretically be replaced with a firmware update, even on a locked phone. In fact, this is something Apple allegedly did for law enforcement around 2012, back when the iPhone’s operating system was less secure and Edward Snowden hadn’t yet turned government surveillance into a hot political issue.

So, there you have it. Apple’s next event is then.
But at what time?
Today, my friends, is that day.
On March 21, Apple will bestow upon us a new product — rumored to be an iPhone called iPhone SE, with a smaller body close to the size of the iPhone 5S, but with the speed and features of the newer iPhone 6S. Oh, happy day!
It’s finally here. After months of waiting, the Apple event is actually happening. What event? Oh, you know, just the big one. Apple. Event. Tech. Slides. Graph. Keynote. Announce. It’s all happening on the big stage.
Tim Cook’ll be there, leading the circus in a rousing techapalooza. “Small iPhone. Big iPad. Apps. New … chips,” he’ll say with a wry smirk. “Siri.”
Sounds amazing, right? So when’s all this going down? I’m glad you asked. It’s very difficult to find information on when Apple’s next keynote is. Apple is very secretive about invites. Luckily, we managed to dig up a few articles.
“Apple Is Making a Big Announcement This Month,” Time
“Apple Sends Invites for ‘Let Us Loop You In’ Media Event on March 21,” MacRumors
Rihanna has been promoting her next album cryptically for the last few months. Anti, her first album since 2012, was first announced at a private event in L.A. last October, and then further intimated with a Samsung-sponsored website called ANTIdiaRy. Despite the PR rollout, Anti was not finished and since then, the singer has been mostly silent. This has led to frustrated fans wondering, “Where’s Anti?”
This morning, Rihanna indirectly announced that the album was nearing its release, and that she was listening to it.
You might think that a single picture of Rihanna wearing ostentatious headphones is not enough material for a meme. Yet the internet was able to MacGyver a meme using only the picture, a rubber band, and two bendy straws. Thus, “listening to ANTI 🎈” was born.
Opinionated first started creeping into developer lingo after being prominently featured in Getting Real, a 2006 strategy book self-published by the Chicago-based software company Basecamp, then known as 37 Signals. The fourth chapter ends with a segment titled “Make Opinionated Software“:
In other words, a program can be philosophically concerned with larger issues in the world, beyond its own error-free execution.
This notion has always existed, but more explicit examples proliferated once the approach was codified. Today, opinionated musical software might try to steer you away from dissonant chords that would sound bad, and an opinionated spell-checker might refuse to recognize foul language. Facebook’s popular library REACT took off in part because it argued very effectively for powerful simplifications of the many confusing ways in which data can flow through complex systems. These days, whenever the Python programming language presents multiple similar solutions to the same problem, the options are often immediately subjected to intense debate about which are most “Pythonic” — that is, best aligned with the governing principles of the language. The web-development package Ruby on Rails even conveys its opinionated nature right in its name: “On Rails” is a phrase used in game design to describe scenarios in which the player’s freedom of motion is deliberately limited so as to instead emphasize other elements.
For the most part, software can’t yet think entirely on its own, so its opinions ultimately derive from the people behind the projects. Someone powerful at Google wanted Gmail to provide them with a large corpus of text for analysis, and to hold on to its users by organizing their message history so that text could be processed again later as new analytical techniques emerged. Ruby on Rails is powered by people who don’t much care to micromanage every minute detail when building things for the web. Opinionated software interprets human priorities and values as program architectures. The scope of the opinions can thus sometimes be accordingly broad.
Firefox, the popular web browser project of the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, is built around open sharing: development happens in public, and the codebase is freely provided under a flexible open-source license. But a huge impediment to those goals emerged around the turn of the decade with the release of the newest revision of HTML, the language used to write web pages. One of the most prominent new features in HTML5 was integrated multimedia support, which allowed videos to be decoded by the browsers directly, instead of always being offloaded to a separate plug-in component such as Flash or QuickTime. This was a very big deal – even YouTube was soon rewritten around the new functionality. Unfortunately, the best video encoder on the market was subject to patents that were irreconcilable with the Mozilla Foundation’s vision of a free and open internet, in particular for users in emerging third world markets where even small licensing fees for media playback might actually turn out to be consequential. As a result, for many years Firefox would only read videos made using an alternative free encoder, doubling the number of files in circulation and vastly complicating all web-based video software. Mozilla eventually caved in on this point, but until that finally happened, the deliberately contentious design of the Firefox multimedia system was a specific, elegant, highly visible, and completely exasperating argument that access to the web should be fundamentally free.
One reliable peril of advanced technologies is that the details of implementation usually aren’t yet common knowledge among most people — often including judges and lawyers, regrettably — but the compulsion of speech, or software-as-speech, isn’t made any more acceptable simply because fewer people know how to interpret it. The FBI’s demands in this case rely on that confusion: Its application for the order to compel Apple to provide them with the custom software states that “writing software code is not an unreasonable burden for a company that writes software code as part of its regular business.” This phrasing contains a subtle gamble: that both the courts and the public will conceive of the software as a tangible artifact produced by an incomprehensible factory in the clouds, rather than fully considering its design and development a coordinated act driven by human motivations, politics, and principles. Never mind that the FBI itself employs a formidable staff of politically motivated technologists, and is deploying them in pursuit of this case!
The argument that the iPhone and iOS are structurally opinionated when it comes to matters of privacy and encryption will require that Apple demonstrate that the various subcomponents are coherently aligned. This remains to be seen, since only Apple has access to the proprietary source code, but it seems likely enough, considering that the newer models of the phone now also include a secondary computer for managing the encryption keys safely. No matter how this turns out, the continuum that stretches from the iPhone’s encryption layer all the way out to human values does not end at Apple’s doorstep, because Apple operates in a world that the rest of us built and now have to live in. The semantics of the engineering term are not so different from the colloquial meaning, so if the designs of Apple’s products turn out to be demonstrably opinionated, then the logical conclusion would seem to be that the government is trying to outlaw a value system, literally forcing an opinion by undermining architectural decisions that were guided by priorities that diverge from those of its intelligence agencies. Whether or not this succeeds, we should consider what the attempt means for the rest of the world beyond Cupertino.
The FBI is headed toward a brutal legal showdown with Apple over a court order that requires the computer manufacturer to create a custom software tool designed to undermine the security and encryption features in the iPhone recovered from San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook. A central element of the case is the treatment of Apple’s code as a type of “free speech,” because the United States government is clearly not allowed to compel speech that does not yet exist from objecting parties any more than it can silence existing statements it simply doesn’t approve of.
By now there’s plenty of precedent by which First Amendment protections have been applied to software — but the nature of that characterization isn’t always consistent. There’s an obvious similarity of form: Both code and more conventional written statements are presented as readable text. In a motion to vacate the order filed by Apple on February 25, Erik Neuenschwander, Apple’s manager of user privacy, directly likens code to prose. “[W]riting software,” he claims, “is an iterative, revision intensive, and mentally challenging task, just like writing essays, whitepapers, memos, and even poems.” There’s a sense, however, in which this description papers over the ultimately utilitarian nature of code: A poem does not set out to accomplish anything so mechanical as a set of commands sent to a processor. To the extent we feel compelled to compare code to other texts, it might be more accurate to liken coding to writing an instruction manual: still able to carry expressive meaning in the right hands, but also usually removed from the purely artistic goals of a poet.
Zooming out, there’s also another more compelling level of abstraction. An astute amicus brief filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in support of Apple explains how the FBI’s requests would have lasting ramifications for the company’s identity:
This is true. But it’s not just that the FBI’s demands could be considered unreasonable because Apple’s programmers may disagree. There’s another party at stake. Software itself can have opinions, too.
Bear with me here. We should anthropomorphize only very carefully, since “information wants to be free” got a little out of hand, but the truth is that opinionated is a very real term in software development, used to explain how code works and even to plan entire program architectures.
When used by programmers to describe their software projects, the word opinionated means that a program intrinsically embodies some conception of “the right way” of doing its job, usually at the expense of flexibility. The tradeoff is made based on broad goals or values that are not or cannot be included in the source code directly, but are still expressed through indirect reflection. This simplifying clarity then guides downstream decisions, sometimes even allowing the application to make them automatically.
At the macro level, Gmail could be considered an opinionated email application in the sense that it is designed to encourage message retention — that is, it prefers “archiving” and saving messages instead of outright deleting them. As a result, it always subtly guides users toward searching and filtering their messages, and to save them indefinitely instead of routinely deleting them; “search don’t sort” was among its stated principles at launch. These goals are evident throughout the application in many different ways: It launched with vastly more storage space than any of its competitors, the command to delete an individual message is buried under nested menus, and the search bar is always the second thing rendered on the screen, preceded only by the logo.
Credit where credit’s due: Amazon is very good at giving its customers different, weird ways to part with their money. Its line of cheap entry-level tablets is designed around making it easier to click the order button and to stream video, and they also make Wi-Fi-enabled logo-emblazoned buttons that order products with one press. (Full disclosure: I have one of these stupid buttons and use it to order Gatorade.)
The latest possible way to pay Amazon is via selfie. In a recent patent application, via Recode, the company details how sending them a picture of your face could authenticate payments. Facial recognition is, in many ways, more secure than a password, but there are other reasons besides security. As the application states, password entries “require the user to turn away from friends or co-workers when entering a password, which can be awkward or embarrassing in many situations.”
Selfie authentication isn’t the only way Amazon wants you to authorize a purchase. As other examples, users could potentially also tilt their head, smile, or blink. Whether or not emoting at your phone is less intrusive to your social life than entering a password is not quite clear.
Lying just below the service of all this great meme-ing is a meta reflection on Jepsen’s career trajectory. Emotion, the album the song is from, was critically acclaimed but a commercial flop when it was released last August. Some have dismissed her as a one-hit wonder, but true fans will still find any opportunity to sing Emotion’s praises.
Really, #RunAwayWithMeme is about three things:
1. The saxophone solo is corny as hell, but it rips.
2. Not enough people listened to Carly Rae Jepsen’s latest album.
3. This song is just a banger, pure and simple.
Here at Following, we do our best to inform you about the latest online trends as quickly as we can. When we know about it, you’ll know about it — except that sometimes this isn’t true. Sometimes, memes are better when not every single person on earth is aware of them. That may sound quote-unquote hipster, and, well, it is. But that’s how it goes. Sometimes fame ruins things and sometimes it doesn’t and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t factor that variable into how I choose what blog posts to write.
All of this is to say that for the last couple of weeks, I have known about a meme, and yet, I kept it to myself. I apologize.
Please enjoy… #RunAwayWithMeme.
Yes, after years of waiting, Carly Rae Jepsen has a second meme to call her very own (the first being the 2012 earworm “Call Me Maybe”). There are many different aspects to the #RunAwayWithMeme, but the two main ones involve the song’s unimpeachable saxophone opening, and the drop when it reaches the chorus.
The whole thing works a bit like Rickrolling — it plays on your expectations. Is someone going to play any sort of brass or wind instrument, or are they going to make a loud, sustained noise? Maybe replace the audio with the sax solo “Run Away With Me.” Just a suggestion.
Here is Rihanna caught off guard.
A new development in way-too-expensive Williamsburg, New York, is offering a new, high-tech reason to move in: Slack. Slack — the chat program and all-consuming blob combining Gchat, Dropbox, and email — is popular in office and enterprise situations, though it’s also gaining a foothold elsewhere, in casual situations. Like your apartment!
Here’s a scenario direct from Brad Hargreaves, the CEO of Common, the company trying to turn adult living into dorm lyfe: “Someone will say they are making pancakes [in the channel] on a Sunday morning, and people will show up and have their own impromptu breakfast.” Hmmm … no, thanks! Being in constant communication with your neighbors sounds like a nightmare.
I strongly believe that there should be high barriers to communication with neighbors, especially those you aren’t friends with. A recent example from my life: A neighbor (whom I do not know) took their dying Christmas tree out to the curb, leaving needles all over the stairs. They did not clean them up. There was a trail of tree leavings going all the way from the front door to their apartment. It was not — in the grand scheme of things — annoying, but, also, cleaning up would have taken five minutes and been the considerate thing to do.
Here’s what would have happened if my apartment building had a dedicated Slack channel: I would have left a dumb, passive-aggressive note and come off looking like a real grouch and a schmuck.
Here’s what actually happened in my Slack-less building: I said nothing and did nothing, and my annoyance lessened gradually over a few days, in direct correlation with the amount of leaves in the hallway.
Another anecdote: A neighbor once came to my door to complain about the volume of my music (it was seven in the morning, which I think is the daytime, but whatever, I’m over it). I felt a deep and abiding shame because I had to look that person in the face, and they had to do likewise.
Slack diminishes that experience and makes it a lot easier to bug people about stuff. If I had a Slack channel for my apartment, I would be terrible, and I bet pretty much everyone else would be, too. Bugging your neighbor should not be as easy as sending a text.
If you’ve been to the airport recently, you might have experienced the TSA Randomizer, an app that decides into which line passengers get placed for screening: either the standard line or the much quicker PreCheck line. The purpose of this is two-fold. The app “[makes] it harder for potential terrorists to detect any patterns,” reported Bloomberg in 2014, and “[t]he randomization also helps to prevent accusations of racial or other profiling. The program is used at peak travel times when queues increase, such as early morning and evening.”
How much might you expect to pay for the development of an app whose sole function is to choose between two binary options? Would you pay as much as $1.4 million? Because that is apparently how much the federal Department of Homeland Security paid for the Randomizer.
According to a FOIA request from developer Kevin Burke, the $1.4 million was paid to IBM over nine transactions between May 2014 and August 2015. Burke’s FOIA response only contained the contract award’s largest single transaction of $336,414, so whether or not the other eight transactions were for the Randomizer as well, or for other associated work, is unclear. “They might have just gotten the iPad app; they might have gotten iPads, or work on multiple different apps, including the TSA Randomizer,” Burke wrote.
In any case, paying — at minimum — $336,000 for work on the Randomizer seems like a lot. Then again, coding a truly random algorithm is no joke. Computers aren’t designed to act randomly; they’re designed to do the opposite: perform the same task identically every time. So when you combine a seemingly counterintuitive function with the stringent security measures of the DHS, that six-figure bill begins to make a little more sense.
Note that, in 2001, we were still trying to frame internet virality in terms of TV: “It’s like people seeing the Budweiser ad and going around saying ‘Wassuuuuuuuup.’”
Only Josh Schachter, who’d been running a weird-links message board called memepool since 1998, described the All Your Base phenomenon in something close to contemporary terms, calling it “a fairly virulent meme.”
Fifteen years later, memes come and go much more quickly and in much greater quantities than the Y2K-era media ever anticipated. “Something weird is happening on the internet” is still a news story, but it’s a given that something weird will happen on the internet every day, and that it will disappear just as rapidly.
Back then, it took All Your Base years to spread and years to die — and it happened in a time before social media, so there were no #brands on the scene to exhume its corpse for advertising purposes. There was no Twitter, so there were no fast-food burger chains tweeting bad “All Your Baes Are Belong to Us” puns.
It was a more innocent time, before somebody set up us the bomb.
Fifteen years ago, long before everyone knew what an “internet meme” was, the first real internet meme was born. It was a flash video that married a bad techno track, robotic text-to-speech voices, and an absolutely terrible English translation of a Japanese video game. I’m referring, of course, to All Your Base Are Belong to Us.
Internet forum jokesters had been making fun of the incomprehensible script for the game Zero Wing — full of clumsy lines like “Somebody set up us the bomb!” and “You have no chance to survive make your time” — since at least the late ‘90s, but the meme didn’t quite take off until late 2000. That’s when posters on the gaming forum site TribalWar seized on a single line — "All Your Base Are Belong to Us" — as hilarious, and started Photoshopping it into virtually any image that had words.
The game spread to SomethingAwful, which was basically the ground zero for internet humor at that time, and the forum goons there created thousands more All Your Base pics. A meme was born.
But it wouldn’t truly explode into the mainstream until February 15, 2001, when Tribalwar poster Bad_CMC released the All Your Base video. It opened with the infamous Zero Wing cut scene, and then the true innovation kicked in — Bad_CMC used a techno track by a SomethingAwful poster, “Invasion of the Gabber Robots,” which sampled the Zero Wing soundtrack and featured a computerized voice speaking the “All Your Base” line. For the visuals, he used all those forum Photoshops.
The video was weird, and it was perfect. Just weeks after its release, Wired reported on the phenomenon in an article called “When Gamer Humor Attacks.”
“The ‘all your base are belong to us’ T-shirts are already available. Chat rooms are buzzing with ‘all your base’ mutations and gossip. Web reporters are frantically searching for an explanation, firing off e-mails to geek gurus, demanding to know what is going on,” wrote Jeffrey Benner.
Even Fox News awkwardly covered it:
Who’s a good girl?
This dog!!!
At Microsoft’s annual Build conference in Seattle this afternoon, CEO Satya Nadella announced that the company’s next big push is not a new version of Windows, or faster hardware — it’s chatbots, programs that you message in the same way you’d text a friend. Nadella’s grand vision for bots is to make their development easy enough that anyone, not just experienced developers, can do it. (Of course, even experienced developers make mistakes, as Microsoft learned last week when one of their bots turned racist.)
A Bloomberg profile of Nadella’s new initiative explains it thusly:
In many ways, chatbots make sense. If you use Siri or Cortana or “Ok Google” or have ever texted your bank to check your account balance, then you’ve already used one of them. The grand idea here is that language is the main method of interacting with computers, not a pre-designated series of clicks and key presses. (This concept might sound familiar.)
But on top of users switching to bots, the possibly more radical thing Microsoft wants is to lower the barrier for their development. To that end, the company is introducing a bot framework that lets anyone create a program. (Their sample implementation was a bot that people could talk with to order Domino’s pizza.) Complex tasks that are difficult to code, like visual analysis, already exist within the company’s tool kit.
The possibilities are big for Microsoft. If they’re correct in predicting the next era of personal computing, then they’re essentially laying a foundation upon which everything else will be built, similar to how Apple popularized the concept of an app store. And like Apple with the app store, they’re offering a service they can charge money for, or take a cut of transactions that pass through them.

Everyone else: Sad reaction
You: Haha reaction, as in “Haha, heaven isn’t real and religion is the opiate of the masses.”
The company has been testing the feature since last October and is finally ready to roll it out worldwide, which means you no longer have to click like on breakup announcements. And for the people writing those downer announcements, you no longer have to structure them in a way that makes liking them seem like the appropriate response.
There is an obvious side effect of adding more granularity to how people can react to Facebook posts: It gives Facebook and advertisers a better idea of who you are and where your interests lie. If, for example, you were to continually use the angry reaction on posts about Donald Trump, you might see fewer posts about him.
Facebook says Reactions should start rolling out in the next few weeks.
But how is one actually supposed to deploy these new reactions? Navigating the murky waters of social media can be dangerous, so here’s a guide.
Status: “This clip from last night’s Jimmy Fallon is amaaaaaaazing!”
Everyone else: Haha reaction
You: Wow reaction, as in, “Wow, please get off my feed.”
There are lots of ways to become a meme. Your dog could be really cute. You could be making a really dumb face in a single unfortunate photo. Or, you could be a Kurdish military commander and look exactly like Stalin, as Hossein Yazdanpanah does. Yazdanpanah has gone viral on the Russian internet for his eerie resemblance (see the photo above, did someone smuggle some DNA?) to the Soviet dictator. As one Russian news outlet tweets, “With a commander like this, Kurdistan’s army could make it all the way to Berlin.”
Yazdanpanah is a political leader and an aggressive fighter for the Kurdistan Freedom Party in the struggle against ISIS — see this photo from earlier this year.
Already, Slack is becoming a hub for people who don’t even work together, people who just hang out in friend Slacks, or family Slacks, or apartment building-specific Slacks. Slack is enterprise software made personal, while Facebook’s is personal software turned enterprise. The unstated conclusion to services like these is a world in which people are accessible at any moment all the time, either fielding messages in real-time or letting their virtual inbox pile up. Regardless, the door is already partially open.
As meetings and discussions that once took place in oak-paneled boardrooms at gilded tables surrounded by Cigar Men (again, to reiterate, I’ve never worn a suit to work) move online, the question of work-life balance gets muddy. What is work-life balance when you can shift from one to the other as easily as opening an app? If, for instance, you are an hourly worker (the gig economy!) instead of a full-time employee, workplace social networks bring up a billion thorny issues.
On Facebook at Work, when does the work day end? Trick question! It doesn’t.
Are you ready to use Facebook at work? Okay, wait, sorry, the wording here is key. Everyone who doesn’t work in some draconian hell-office uses Facebook at work. What I mean is … Are you ready to use Facebook for work. Like, to talk with co-workers, I guess, about synergy?
Anyway: Facebook at Work. Imagine Facebook, but it’s for everyone in the office and it’s used to talk about projects and graphs and … road maps. (Can you tell that I do not work in biz dev?) It’s not everywhere yet but it is starting to creep out into the wild. Fortune reports that the Royal Bank of Scotland and Club Med are among the companies testing out the service on their thousands of employees (more than 60,000 companies reportedly applied to be part of the beta).
Facebook at Work is reportedly not all that different from the Facebook you use now to look at baby pictures, observe your friends’ emotionally fulfilling romantic relationships, and watch free-booted WorldStar videos. Except this work-version of Facebook is more about “project updates, sales leads, and customer service problems.” It’s got all of the features you’re used to: groups, news feed, chat, event listings, and so on.
Important to note is that Facebook at Work does not interface with your personal account. From the service’s FAQ, “Facebook at Work is a separate account that is associated with your company.”
Here’s what it looks like.
Facebook at Work makes sense! People use Facebook all the time anyway. You can claim that you don’t use Facebook, and in almost all cases you are for-sure lying. Mainly, this is Facebook’s best shot at eating Slack (as well as competitors such as HipChat), the chat-and-collaboration hub around which a growing number of modern workplaces are situating their computers. Slack, in case you were skeptical of how big it is, is currently pursuing a $4 billion valuation.
But there’s a large shadow looming over services like Facebook at Work and Slack that they generally don’t acknowledge. If you watched the above video (and it’s okay if you didn’t; it is very twee), you might have noticed that every scenario the service presents is in an office context. Facebook at Work never leaves the office in this conception. In reality, work-based social networks are tethers that keep you just keystrokes away from checking in with work wherever you are, at any hour of the day. This is especially true if the service supplies mobile apps (which Facebook and Slack do).
The whole strange drama is below, narrated on Twitter by VoidBurger, the first person to call attention to AlexShepherd and his singular quest.
The obsessive administrator of a wiki site dedicated to the video-game horror franchise Silent Hill, so devoted to the site that he’s made 40,000 edits, apparently went mad with power this week and decided that Silent Hill isn’t just about a spooky hospital. It’s actually a subtle allegory against male circumcision. That’s a new one!
The power struggle started when someone noticed that the administrator, AlexShepherd, had turned a character’s biography on the site into an 800-word rant about “male genital mutilation,” speculating that the character had been circumcised as a child. That seemed strange, so the anonymous editor removed the circumcision references.
AlexShepherd freaked the hell out, and has continued freaking.
“You’re a fucking horrible human being for advocating GENITAL MUTILATION, and 99 percent of Americans who advocate mutilating penises are fucking brainwashed morons,” he wrote to the anonymous editor who changed his post. “Circumcision can have a HUGE EFFECT and HUGE INFLUENCE on the development of a human being’s psyche. It’s the truth. What you are trying to do is erase American history and hide the truth. Seriously, don’t be on the wrong side of history. It’s like trying to delete the Holocaust article on Wikipedia, saying it’s some ‘anti-Holocaust’ or ‘anti-Nazi’ rant. That’s how brainwashed you sound.”
As other fans of Silent Hill continued to dispute the games are about circumcision, based solely on the fact that there’s actually nothing about circumcision in them, AlexShepherd only dug his heels in deeper. He argued that because he “grew up with Silent Hill as a child” and sees himself as one of the five “best Silent Hill fans in the world,” he’s able to notice subtleties in the game that others can’t.
And besides, it doesn’t matter who disagrees with him, because he is the most prolific editor of the Silent Hill wiki. That basically means he owns it. So if he wants the site to be about a Satanic/Illuminati conspiracy about babies’ penises, then that’s how it’s going to be.
“And LOL @ me being removed as an admin by a random anon IP user,” he wrote. “You all realize this entire site is essentially mine, right? I am the top admin/bureaucrat of this site and have been for years. I have 40k edits on this site, and the next admin has 13k.”
There’s really not much the anonymous editors can do, other than bail out and leave the foreskin-obsessed despot to his own private website. The internet lost a wiki about the Silent Hill games this week, but it gained a wiki about the anti-circumcision movement.
These jokes are great individually, but their sheer volume is another joke in itself. There’s enough material here for a Bundy Militia erotic comedy fanfic novella of respectable length. Much stranger things have happened in the darker corners of Amazon’s Kindle store, believe me.
All in all, an excellent use of a day on Twitter — and of the Bundys’ beloved First Amendment.
As Ammon Bundy and his fellow militiamen continued to occupy the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon Tuesday night, praying for snacks and free federal land, the Decemberists singer and Wildwood author Colin Meloy felt inspiration striking: He couldn’t wait to read erotic fanfiction about this ridiculous standoff.
He wouldn’t have to wait long either, because he started writing it himself on Twitter. His followers, possibly somewhere between amused and aroused, joined in with their own contributions. Although Meloy tapped out after just six hours of writing short, homoerotic vignettes about rural gun enthusiasts, the #bundyeroticfanfic hashtag continued for a full day — an orgy of beards, bird-watching, and Bundys:
Look, there’s not much to say about this Vine without spoiling it. Vines are only six seconds! What do you want? A play-by-play? Sorry, I won’t do that. I’d like to preserve the mystique and surprise of this very good Vine! All I can say about this Vine is that if you open your heart to love, love will find you. You might have given up on finding the One, but he/she/xe is out there.
The tiny port town of Goole in East Yorks, U.K., has just about the worst SEO in history. Every time its residents look for something about the place they live online, Google, in all its narcissism, assumed they meant to search for the company instead. So a group of volunteers from the Goole Museum decided to launch their own search engine.
The result is Goole isn’t Google, a site designed solely to search for information about Goole, a fascinating place with a population of 19,000 founded in 1862—way before the tech company. “All we’re trying to say is that Goole isn’t a search engine,” says Chris Collins, with the despair only those ignored by the Internet can know. Enter a term into the Goole search engine, and you’ll get information about its port, its links to the Dutch, or its numerous pubs.
Instead of Googling, try Gooling! Just don’t expect to find much.
Daniel Schneidermann, writing on Arrêt Sur Images, took the most extreme anti-lolcat stance, asking whether a compulsory “chatonnisation” — catifying — of the media during emergencies was coming next.
“Obviously, to avoid publishing geographic information during a police operation does not undermine press freedom,” he wrote, “But will we then refrain from criticizing police action if — it can happen — it’s poorly conducted? Will we refrain from speaking to the neighbors of the searched apartments? The lawyers of the arrested?”
It’s an odd effect of social media — the same techniques that allow for the rapid distribution of information also allow for the rapid distribution of noise. But what should be most disquieting to free-speech advocates isn’t censorship — the lolcats only have the effect of making a search more difficult, not impossible — but the eager and performative attempts of citizens to not just comply with, but extend, a police gag order.
As of Monday morning, 21 people had been detained after police raids in Brussels and Liege. There’s still no information about those arrested, but police did say that Abdeslam, the primary suspect, was not among them. Around 1,000 officers are reportedly involved in the manhunt.
Police also made sure to thank everyone for the lolcats:
Police in Brussels, Belgium have locked down the city for a third straight day as they search for Salah Abdeslam, a suspect in the terrorist attacks in Paris earlier this month. Belgian authorities have asked Brussels residents not to tweet about police action, in case the suspects they seek are monitoring social media. And citizens have obliged — with enough cat pictures.
Some Bruxellois have been spamming the #BrusselsLockdown hashtag with lolcat pictures and memes, attempting to prevent any observers from gaining information about the police action. Did it work? Well, it did, but the way most social-media stories work: Only once the news media got involved. At first, there weren’t enough cats to bury the latest information about police raids around the city, but the trick started to work once international media picked up the story of the lolcat brigade. Now #BrusselsLockdown seems to feature more stories about cat pics than actual cat pics (and more cat pics than news about the manhunt.)
Even some Belgian news outlets complied with the police request. Le Soir’s Christophe Berti defended his paper’s decision to observe radio silence, saying, “We do not play with lives. It is not censorship nor a way to prevent us from doing our jobs.”
But, as some journalists are asking, are we dealing with lolcats ou censure? By quickly jumping to the aid of the police, are Brusselians fighting terrorism or blocking the flow of crucial information to a public that has the right to know? Pourquoi pas les deux?
Plus, the company’s response to the Shade Room has been wildly disproportionate. Rather than take down the offending posts or warn Nwandu beforehand, Facebook removed the publication’s presence entirely. It plays into the media’s worst anxiety toward the tech companies trying to lure them: If Facebook doesn’t like something, it can just disappear it. When you run a publication on someone else’s platform, you let them have the final say. For news organizations, that’s never a good position to be in.
Yesterday, in an instant, the popular news site the Shade Room disappeared from Facebook without explanation. The Shade Room, which tracks celebrity gossip, is the first big news service to live entirely on social media: It started as an Instagram account, before expanding onto Facebook and other platforms. It has a website, more or less as an afterthought. Which means that a disappeared Facebook page isn’t just a lost source of traffic — it’s an entire lost arm of the publication.
According to TSR’s advertising kit, the brand has more than eight million followers across all of its web platforms, which include social networks and the dedicated website. Instagram and Facebook are, by far, its most popular presences, with follower counts on both hovering in the mid-four millions.
Much of what the Shade Room does is take and compile content from elsewhere, laying its own watermark on each image. For the most part, the service uses screenshots, but, as Jezebel points out, it occasionally posts professional photos that it doesn’t have the rights to, without attribution.
Angie Nwandu, who runs the Shade Room, confirmed that her Facebook page had been shut down but told the Nieman Lab that no explanation had been given (the Instagram account, which Nwandu briefly took private, is still live). A rep for Facebook later told Jezebel that TSR had violated community guidelines, but did not elaborate further.
Today, the company told CNN that the page was in trouble for repeatedly violating intellectual property rights. The move makes a bit more sense when placed next to Facebook’s newly unveiled Rights Manager tool, meant to give IP holders the ability to monitor unauthorized use of their work. Facebook is cracking down on copyright violations — a huge issue that had gone largely untouched until this year.
But Rights Manager is of little comfort to the thousands of pages that have built a following upon generous interpretations of “fair use” — Facebook pages that could disappear in an instant for a single alleged infraction.
That swiftness with which TSR’s Facebook page disappeared, and the lack of explanation that accompanied it, really encapsulate the current moment of media’s relationship to platform holders. Facebook’s big pitch is that by placing video and articles directly on their network, and thus the site’s weighing them more heavily in the News Feed algorithm, media organizations will experience increased readership. This is, for the most part, true — participants in the Instant Articles program are seeing compelling increases in reach, as are those making a big push into video.
But that can all disappear in an instant (no pun intended) if one runs afoul of Facebook’s nebulous community guidelines or practices. When companies take advantage of Facebook’s platform offerings, they’re also ceding a lot of editorial control to Facebook, which has been inconsistent when it comes to enforcing its rules. (For instance, Facebook is institutionally terrified of female nipples in almost any context.)
Hogan’s team’s defense, on the other hand, appears to be, in part … existential? While Hulk Hogan and Terry Bollea are ostensibly the same person, the distinction between Bollea and his alter ego is a key component of his side’s argument. Hogan testified earlier Tuesday that in his interview appearances, he was in character as Hogan, not Bollea. “I was in character and I embellished a little bit about the number of women,” he testified, later adding, “I was on an entertainment show and I had to be an entertainer, so I just kept going.”
All of this leads to some conflicting indication of who, precisely, is on the stand. The plaintiff seems to be arguing that Terry Bollea is talking about the character he plays, Hulk Hogan — the idea being that while Hulk Hogan may be a public figure who brags about his sex life, Terry Bollea is just a regular Florida guy. Hulk Hogan says the bad things; Terry Bollea has sex with his friend’s wife. This is a fascinating, if a bit muddled, argument that may work here but would work less well in, say, a murder trial. Last summer, the judge in the case ruled that Bollea would be allowed to wear his dress bandana (a quintessential Hulk detail) in court. So a question yet unanswered is, exactly how separate is Hulk Hogan from the man who supposedly plays him?
Bollea speaking directly about Hogan as a theatrical creation is actually an uncommon event in the world of pro wrestling — an act known as breaking kayfabe.
How big is Hulk Hogan’s penis?
Among the aspects of Hulk Hogan that Bollea, um, augmented in public was his penis length. “I do not have a 10 inch penis….Terry Bollea’s penis is not 10 inches,” he admitted.
Has Hulk Hogan ever fought or tamed wild animals?
Hulkamania is running wild, brother. The trial between pro wrestler Terry Bollea — better known as Hulk Hogan — and Gawker, the gossip website that posted excerpts from a tape showing Bollea and the wife of a friend having sex, is currently under way in Florida this week.
Hogan admitted to lying about fighting animals, having neither body-slammed an elephant nor surfed a tiger shark.
In what other ways has Hulk Hogan failed?
The previous day, Hogan spoke on a number of topics including his attempt to fix his relationship with now-ex-wife Linda Hogan. He stated unequivocally that their reality show, Hogan Knows Best, was fully scripted.
Perhaps most devastatingly, Hogan did not speak fondly of his brief time at TNA, a WWE competitor. It was, according to him, a “small company.”
Was there anything for the New York–media Twitter crowd to joke and gossip about?
The day ended with the taped depositions of Emma Carmichael (Gawker’s managing editor at the time) and John Cook (then a … senior writer, I think? A long portion of his deposition was closely focused on his specific titles and his overall career path). Parts of the deposition focused on Gawker’s content strategy and how aggressive their tactics were in terms of getting traffic, while other sections included transcripts from the site’s internal chat rooms, including questions such as “Was it common at Gawker to share pictures of penises with colleagues? Did that happen on a regular basis?” Cook’s answer was no.
(Disclosure: Following editor Max Read used to work at Gawker and was the subject of an excruciating moment during Cook’s deposition in which Cook was forced to explain a bad joke Read had made in Gawker internal chats.)
Bollea’s argument is that Gawker violated his privacy, publishing in a fit of greed excerpts of a tape recorded without his knowledge. Gawker’s is that the sex-tape excerpts constituted newsworthy reporting on a public figure: As Gawker has pointed out, Bollea publicly discussed his sex life — including the question of whether he’d had sex with the woman in the tape, Heather Clem, wife of radio shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge Clem.
But the case has larger ramifications. At stake are questions of free speech, newsworthiness, and privacy that resonate across a changing media landscape. To what extent can a public figure have an expectation of privacy? What constitutes the “public interest” in reporting? What is the ontological distinction between Hulk Hogan and Terry Bollea, if any? And has Hulk Hogan ever body-slammed an elephant? Read on to explore those questions — and more!
Let’s set the scene:
Who, precisely, is Hulk Hogan?
Gawker’s main defense, which its lawyers laid out last summer when the lawsuit was originally set to go to trial, is that the sex tape was of public interest because it directly contradicted statements that Bollea/Hogan had made in interviews in which he’d openly discussed his sex life.
Most coders use some type of version-control software to track changes to their work over time. Letting them compare different versions of software — called “commits” — easily. Looking at a program’s past iterations offers indications of how and how quickly it has evolved. Which again makes me wonder, do music and art, as they switch to a more flexible release model via the internet, need their own version of Git? (This is, admittedly, a stupid and gimmicky question.)
Should past commits — a song’s journey from rough demo to finished master — be visible? The space between the edits can often be almost as interesting as the edits themselves. Last month, Jon Caramanica at the New York Times wrote:
There is also an easy and cynical interpretation of this. West has been vocal in his attempts to get people to subscribe to Tidal to hear his album. It is not available anywhere else. If Kanye were to lock in The Life of Pablo, and never update it again, people could get their fill and then drop their subscriptions. But if the work is constantly in flux, people might stick around to see what happens.
On Tuesday night, Kanye West patched an album. That might sound odd, but that’s the best way to describe it. The initial version that West released on Tidal was, to his mind, full of bugs and glitches. And, as though it were a video game or an app or another big software release, he updated the album, patched the bugs, and released a new version on Tidal.
In video-game development, these bugs are referred to as “known shippables,” meaning that developers are aware of them, but the defects are not crippling, and they can be fixed after release. Most video games these days are released alongside day-one patches meant to correct problems that weren’t remedied by the time discs started to be manufactured. Developers have come to rely on the day-one patch so much that several high-profile releases, like Battlefield 4 and Assassin’s Creed Unity, have launched with serious glitches, at times unplayable.
In updating TLOP, Kanye was addressing the known shippables in his album. “Ima fix wolves,” he tweeted shortly after its release, referring to the album’s final track. And, by all accounts, he did last night, even separating Frank Ocean’s vocals into a new track not included in the original release. He also changed at least one lyric, according to a Reddit thread tracking the changes.
Kanye is, if not the first, certainly the highest-profile artist to consider music as a service, rather than a one-off product. Software companies have been moving toward similar models in recent years: Instead of marquee releases, they ship incremental upgrades and feature additions on a more regular basis — small steps instead of one massive leap. Adobe’s creative tools used to cost hundreds of dollars, now they cost a much lower (but never-ending) subscription fee. Microsoft’s latest suite of Office applications offers a similar pricing scheme. Apple’s recent trend of a rebranded, free OS X upgrade every year is high-speed relative to other OS release schedules.
That’s what Kanye evidently hopes to achieve with his music: a perpetual motion machine of releasing new material and patching it. He’s announced plans for another two albums this year (one named after the early TurboGrafx-16 game console). Three major feature releases is an outsize output for a musician right now, but not a nimble tech company.
It’s in part a business decision — a confluence of trends affecting both the software and tech industries and the music industry. What is true of Adobe Photoshop is true of The Life of Pablo, too: The rise of digital distribution means piracy is all but guaranteed for high-profile one-offs; people are increasingly tied to always-online devices, and much of what they do “on their phones” is really taking place far away, on cloud servers owned by much larger companies; platforms and distribution channels have been consolidated, and developers and musicians can both make use of that consolidation to exert more control over their products.
But there are interesting artistic questions that Kanye’s release plans raise, too. Is there version control for art? Not really, but artists have been tweaking their work for decades. There are five different cuts of Blade Runner. The Wikipedia entry for changes George Lucas made to Star Wars runs an obsessive thousands of words long. A new edition of Hillary Clinton’s biography omits certain details. Last fall, the video game Destiny completely cut out all of the voice-acting done by Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage and replaced it. The website NewsDiffs tracks corrections in the same way GitHub tracks source-code changes. Creative works, as much as we like to think otherwise, rarely have one version.
West is clearly aware of how people consume music nowadays. When he initially released the wrong version of “No More Parties in LA” in January, he quickly took it down and asked, “When it’s back up all rippers please rip the new one instead.” Remix culture has exploded thanks to the internet, but it’s less common for an artist to make the changes themselves. Remix culture builds upon, but what Kanye is doing is swapping out.
What were your mentions like while the tweet was going viral?
Josh Nalven: It’s almost like if you’re watching competitive eating. It’s like, “Wow. How many hard-boiled eggs can this guy shove in his mouth? How many eel tweets before the internet decides it’s had enough?”
Has anything awkward come of this tweet?
JN: One guy did a Vine of him singing it, and at-replied me about it. I was like, I don’t really know what to do about that.
Before you posted the tweet, did you think it might go viral?
Ashley Ford: I’m just not that strategic. Sometimes I just kind of want to put a funny thing out there. I don’t want to burn out … I don’t want to be going so hard or joylessly every day that I get to a point where I can’t even think about justice and ending police brutality and things like that anymore.
What’s the best thing that came of this tweet?
AF: It did make for an interesting conversation with my family. Most of my family on my mother’s side works in law enforcement. I’m black, and my family’s black, but I was worried that people would be defensive, and think of themselves as law enforcement first, black second. And that’s not the case. They definitely feel conflicted.
Celebrities reach insane levels of Twitter exposure every day, just by existing. Justin Bieber recently got 60,000 retweets by simply tweeting “Happy thanksgiving”… on October 11. So what happens when a Twitter civilian hits that level of exposure?
Can you talk a little about the horse?
Caleb McGowen: The horse’s name is Harvey Bailey. He’s my grandparents’. When they saw the tweet, they thought it was pretty cool that their horse was famous.
What’s the best thing that came out of the tweet?
CM: Nothing really. I got 300 followers, but that’s about it.
Before you posted this tweet, did you think it might go viral?
CM: I knew that it was going to go viral. Oh, yeah.
Is there a response to the tweet that stands out as your favorite?
Demi Adejuyigbe: I love every response that asks where I got the DVDs. I like faving those tweets to show I saw them, but not responding. I mean, if I went “online bulk ordering” or “Blockbuster goin’ out of business, baby!” it would be much less funny than imagining a Click truck tipping over on the highway, or some sort of elaborate DVD heist.
There’s an obvious response: new followers and replies, and lots of bots and shady "parody accounts" copying your tweet to bolster their numbers. But also: a deep sense of satisfaction. To the users who find and share them, viral tweets are Twitter’s Easter eggs; to the people who write them, viral tweets are more like winning Lotto tickets that don’t get you any money. They lift their writers to a level of internet renown that anyone could reach, theoretically, but few actually do.
Have your parents seen the tweet?
DA: Yeah, my sister brought it up one time to all of us. My parents said they’d seen the tweet at some point, and they went upstairs to see the DVDs themselves and just went, “Oh, huh,” and left. They still didn’t talk to me about it, even after the tweet.
To find out more about that experience, I microinterviewed five people whose tweets have gone viral. They’re probably best known by their handles: @skullmandible, @jnalv, @iSmashFizzle, @heloocaleb, and @electrolemon. Here’s what they said.
Does this tweet ever get stolen?
Cohen Edenfield: Constantly. I’m of two minds about it. If it’s just some high-schooler doing it, I don’t care about that. What irritates me is when it’s stolen by people who are turning their Twitters into something where they sell promoted tweets. So it’s just getting turned into somebody’s marketing thing, so they can then sell tweets for 25 bucks to Bud Light.
CE: I’m the head writer on the video game that they’re making of "Homestuck," and the creators reached out to me in part because they liked my Twitter. I would say health insurance was the best thing that came out of the tweet?
Fernandez is just the latest young video star to be accused of sexual misconduct. Teenage Vine hunk Carter Reynolds was seen on video apparently pressuring a 16-year-old girl for oral sex, and controversial British prankster Sam Pepper, 26, was accused of rape and sexual harassment last year.
Despite the public outcry against them, both continue to make videos and command wide audiences. Chances are Fernandez will too.
Teen skater and YouTube star Steve Fernandez was arrested in November for allegedly trying to use his internet fame to solicit sex from a 12-year-old girl. The Los Angeles Police Department announced this week that Fernandez, 15, and two of his older friends are being investigated for sexual exploitation of teens.
The tween victim told detectives that Fernandez and two men “called her over to a car on Ventura Boulevard” and “promised to introduce the girl to A-list performers and appear in Fernandez’s non-existent MTV special in return for her engaging in sexual acts” with them.
Police arranged a sting by posing as the 12-year-old and setting up a meeting with Fernandez for sex in an abandoned building. One of the other men, Fernandez’s 22-year-old manager Jose Barajas, was also caught up in the sting.
The third man in the car, 27-year-old pro skater Keelan Dadd, didn’t go with them to the meeting, but later turned himself in to police
Police believe there may have been other victims, and that “the suspects tended to cruise West San Fernando Valley, Hollywood, and Compton, looking for young girls to solicit.”
Fernandez’s attorney, Ryan D’Ambrosio, claims Fernandez was an innocent victim who was exploited by adults.
“Once the investigation is complete, I think evidence will show that Steven’s celebrity status was preyed on by the adults who were arrested in this matter,” he said in a statement.
Fernandez continues to post on social media, where his schtick is mainly posting photos of himself with crowds and girls, and promoting his clothing line. The most recent video on his YouTube account shows him leaning out the passenger window of an SUV, trying to pick up girls.
“So …,” Evan Griffin writes on YouTube. “Gave my Dad my [camera] while he was in Las Vegas, I did not, however, instruct him on how to use it, so my dad being my dad, and a culchie, didn’t know which way to point the fucking thing …” (A culchie is an Irish hick, basically.)
Is this a viral marketing stunt for the camera brand in question? I would say: probably. Is it still amusing? Yes, very.
CEO Jack Dorsey also announced that more changes would be coming to the board soon to increase diversity. That’s probably also a good move given that the board is mostly white, while the most visible culture on Twitter is generated by black users.
This morning, Twitter announced that it was rotating some of the seats on its board of directors. Newly appointed are PepsiCo CFO Hugh Johnston and entrepreneur Martha Lane Fox, replacing Peter Chernin and Peter Currie. (Guess they “peter”-ed out. Great joke, tweet it.)
Fox has an active presence on the social network; her account was created in 2009. Johnston, on the other hand, seems like a less obvious choice, given that his first tweet ever was sent at 9:29 this morning.
For people worried about Twitter’s future (lol), this might appear odd. A guy who’s never used Twitter … deciding on the direction of Twitter?
This is good. Twitter, as it currently stands, is having difficulty attracting new users. Who better to articulate that problem and fix it than a professionally accomplished businessperson who has never felt the need to use the service? The worst thing the company could do is to bring on people who believe the social network is fine as is and are averse to change (read: most journalists).
I messaged Conrad on Facebook to find out more about this conspiracy.
As far as I can tell, you were the first person to post about the Panthers’ real 6–1 record. What inspired you to reveal the truth?I’m not the first, but I’m a true believer in our 6–1 record. You can’t just go around spouting nonsense about a 7–0 record if it ain’t true, brother.
ESPN, a big sports site, is reporting the 7–0 record. What evidence do you have that they’re mistaken?Well, a lot of it is just a gut feeling, Brian. Then, of course, God spoke to me about it. Also, ESPN are lying libtards. I would trust them as far as I could throw them (like a football).
So you’re saying that the liberal media is falsifying records for the Carolina Panthers? To what end? What’s the goal here?Yeah, that and lizard people. Obama is probably working behind the scenes as well. The fix is in, they want all these bandwagon Caroliner fans to jump on an undefeated team.
Hmmm … this is super interesting. Which team did the Panthers actually lose to?The Patriots, man. Don’t believe all you see or hear.
Mr. Conrad abruptly ended our conversation at this point, noting, “God told me I can’t talk to you anymore, brother. You media types are always out to get us.”
This interview has been edited for grammar and clarity.
Over on the Facebook event page for yesterday’s Panther Talk event, fans are battling over whether the Carolina Panthers’ reported 7–0 record is actually 6–1.
Mainstream news sources, and institutional actors like the NFL and the Carolina Panthers, would have you believe that the Panthers are undefeated, but that supposed “fact” is being reevaluated by football fans flooding Facebook. Are they pranksters? Or are they only people who can see the truth about the Carolina Panthers? Panthers diehards, unswayed, still insist their team is 7–0.
One of the earliest posts alleging that the Panthers’ record is not as it seems came from Austin Conrad, who wrote shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday, “It’s so painful knowing you could be undefeated but oh well 6–1 ain’t bad. Go panthers!”
“We can expect to learn whether the attackers were using encrypted channels of the type FBI Director James Comey has been warning about for the past year … as well whether the attackers avoided specific channels where they believed surveillance was possible,” writes Benjamin Wittes at Lawfare. In other words, as we understand better how the attacks were planned, we can understand what methods terrorists are using to communicate and better target them, rather than resorting to blanket surveillance.
The government likely already has a certain kind of access to plenty of platforms. There are two levels of access when it comes to surveillance. There’s the metadata — who connected to whom, for how long — and then there’s the content of the messages. Encryption protects the specific content of communications, hence the government’s fear and the need for even better back doors. Encryption means that it’s difficult, if not impossible, to read the messages.
Through the PRISM program that the Snowden leaks revealed, the government was already working with many seemingly safe companies and products to get access to that metadata, but not encryption. These included Facebook, Google, Yahoo, YouTube, Skype, AOL, Sprint, AT&T, Apple, and Microsoft. In other words, backdoors likely already existed in familiar technology long before the PS4 rumors. The government is actively working against the encryption software Tor — it even targeted a public library that was offering encrypted internet access, making anonymity more difficult to achieve than ever.
Having access to unencrypted data is rarely enough to prevent attacks. As BuzzFeed reports, France was warned “weekly” about the possibility of a coordinated terrorist attack by Israel and Jordan, though they lacked information about a possible date or targets.
Government agencies and lawmakers will likely propose beefed-up anti-encryption laws. The role that messaging like the PlayStation rumors plays is to drum up mainstream suspicion that encryption is the one thing preventing the government from catching terrorists. Glenn Greenwald pushes back against blaming the Snowden leaks or encryption for the attacks. Terrorists already knew to avoid easily tracked communication channels, so the use of encryption is nothing new, he writes. Government officials “want to demonize encryption generally as well as any companies that offer it.”
Greenwald avoids the point that some access to encrypted information could stop attacks, though the chances of success may be vanishingly small. Which do we value more, the full integrity of our privacy, or that chance that giving up privacy may lead to safety? After all, the U.K. recently proposed a bill that would allow for systematic access to encrypted information. As more information is revealed in Paris, we will be confronted once more with the question, and it applies equally to smartphones and chat apps as video games.
Contrary to rumors inspired by mistaken reporting, it’s unlikely that ISIS planned the Paris attacks using PlayStation 4. The possibility that the video-game system’s inherent encryption technology played a part in ISIS’s plotting incited an avalanche of rhetoric for and against encryption and government surveillance, including remarks made by New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton today on Morning Joe that companies allowing encryption “are working against us” in preventing terrorist attacks.
Bratton’s overheated rhetoric and the rapid spread of a baseless rumor about PlayStation showcases the worst side of our relationship with surveillance and encryption technology. It’s not just that we don’t know how the attacks were planned; it’s that we don’t have a clear picture of the debate over encryption at all — what’s at stake, what’s possible, and what needs to be changed.
At its core, the argument is fairly simple. Most modern messaging applications, like WhatsApp and iMessage, encrypt their data, essentially scrambling it and locking it behind very serious security technology. Governments (or hackers) might be able to intercept communication between two people, but because that communication is encrypted, they’d still have to decrypt it before being able to read it. Depending on the technology used, that process can range from “incredibly difficult and time-consuming” to “impossible.”
This is great for people who want to keep their communication away from prying eyes. But people like Bratton believe that if the government can access all data, all the time, it will be better equipped to detect attacks in advance. Bratton and others, including many government officials in Europe, have argued that tech companies should be forced to build a “back door” into their encryption technologies to allow unfettered access to interpersonal communication.
It’s easy to assume that the government is already reading everything you send, and paranoid crypto experts will warn you that we don’t know the full extent of government surveillance. The NSA has been accused of spending many years and millions of dollars attempting to undermine encryption technology, and the Snowden documents demonstrated that the NSA had far broader access to data from tech companies than was suspected before. But theoretically, the NSA was being given access to “metadata” that could help pinpoint identity and location — not to encryption back doors. If the U.S. forced those companies to build back doors (as the U.K. recently proposed), the NSA and Homeland Security would suddenly have access to a huge swath of communication they’d never had before. And, at the same time, so would many other governments. What else should you know as the encryption debate flares up again?
The attackers likely didn’t use PS4s to communicate, and we need to wait to see how they coordinated the attacks before we can say whether encryption is to blame. How the Paris attackers communicated is uncertain, though they did use encryption. “It was not clear whether the encryption was part of widely used communications tools, like WhatsApp, which the authorities have a hard time monitoring, or something more elaborate,” the New York Times reported, though the newspaper later edited the article.
PS4 isn’t out of the question. An Austrian teenager used a PlayStation console to download bomb plans in June and was later arrested. Authorities say the teenager was also communicating with ISIS members in Syria using the system. But the PlayStation lacks a solid encryption system, according to Motherboard. Experts note that Sony likely has strong access to users’ communication on the system. Video games in general are more difficult to track than web browsers and smartphones, however, and the FBI has previously fought to access Xbox Live. There are simply more spaces and formats to communicate in video games — like Steam chat or the in-game group-message function of an MMORPG.
The security expert Graham Cluley warns against assigning blame to one specific technology. Any digital communication method, from chess apps to World of Warcraft, can be used for clandestine planning. He interprets the blaming of PS4 as “politicians attempting to use the ghastly events as a pawn to promote their own anti-privacy agenda.”
Facebook vice-president for Latin America Diego Dzodan was arrested and quickly released on charges of not complying with Brazilian law enforcement’s requests to access encrypted WhatsApp messages between drug traffickers. (Stop me if you’ve heard this one before.) Judge Ruy Pinheiro said that Dzodan’s arrest constituted “unlawful coercion.”
“We are disappointed with the extreme and disproportionate measure of having a Facebook executive escorted to a police station in connection with a case involving WhatsApp, which operates separately from Facebook,” Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, said in a statement. In a separate statement, WhatsApp said it is literally unable to access the requested messages. Brazil has suspended use of WhatsApp before, for similar reasons, though WhatsApp insisted then, as it is now, that it does not store messages between users on its servers. Reportedly, some 90 percent of Brazilians use WhatsApp.
WhatsApp is generally known as one of the most secure messaging apps, and began implementing end-to-end encryption of messages in late 2014, though a December Re/code report said it had not finished rolling that out to all users. A request for comment to WhatsApp regarding encryption implementation was not returned by press time.
Brazil’s conservative Congress, pushed by the telecoms industry (which has lost millions of customers to WhatsApp), has been pushing laws that would compromise net neutrality, require companies like Google and Facebook to store personal information of users that could be easily accessed by the police, and allow politicians to censor social-media posts, among other initiatives.
Craigslist can be a wonderful place, and despite the existence of newer, flashier, Web 2.0–ier websites, a lot of people still turn to it when they need to buy or sell furniture, cars, bicycles, or large wooden viking ships. And because love is like a chair or a car or a viking ship, people also turn to it when they believe they have found the love of their lives.
Over at Vox, Ilia Blinderman crunched the numbers on 10,000 posts from Craigslist’s legendary Missed Connections sections last January, extracting some interesting results. And what’s the point of crunching those numbers if you’re not going to extract some lessons from them?
Lesson one: Your chances of showing up in a missed connection are pretty slim. In Dallas, there were 12 posts for every 10,000 people; in larger cities like New York and L.A., that stat drops to 3.14 and 1.82 per 10,000, respectively. So don’t obsessively refresh hoping someone will post about you.
If you are going to obsessively refresh, do it in the evening. Blinderman found that — lesson two — the highest number of posts generally occur between 6 and 10 p.m.
Lesson three is probably obvious. If you want to meet someone through a Craigslist missed connection, be a woman. Men posted far more often than women; in L.A., “Men post 5.3 missed connections for every post made by a woman.” In NYC, that ratio dropped to “just” 3 to 1.
What can you do to stand out from the crowd? Don’t use the phrase “eye contact.” In three of the four categories — men seeking men (m4m), men seeking women (m4w), women seeking men (w4m), and women seeking women (w4w) — “eye contact” was among the most-used phrases. (The converse lesson: If you don’t want to show up in a Craigslist missed connections ad, don’t ever make eye contact.)
Finally, not a lesson, just an observation from Blinderman: m4m posts were consistently among the shortest, while w4w posts were often longer.
So what’s the takeaway? It’s tough to say, but I guess it’s this: If you’re constantly refreshing Craigslist during the day, hoping that guy or girl you made eye contact with on the subway spotted you, maybe find a better use of your time.
Hackathons: the event of choice for idealistic Silicon Valley types who think all the world’s ills can be solved through code. Turns out, a bunch of well-intentioned volunteers can’t necessarily fix intractable social problems with an app built in a weekend. Weird! But that doesn’t mean hackathons are all bad. At the annual Stupid Shit No One Needs and Terrible Ideas Hackathon over the weekend, someone built a giant dick that spurts the gross, white “meal substitute” Soylent.
The hackathon was launched two years back by Sam Lavigne and Amelia Winger-Bearskin, and, as its name would indicate, it’s dedicated to building projects “that have no value whatsoever.” But the Stupid Hackathon is not actually stupid. It is very good. And its projects do have tremendous value. Tremendous comedy value.
Case in point: the aforementioned Soylent Dick, created by Nicole He, Katherine Pan, and Chino Kim. It’s a phallus made of wire mesh and Soylent-based Play-Doh that will ejaculate Soylent into your mouth or a cup if you feed it by typing in some lines about how wonderful Soylent is. This … is brilliant. It’s a parody of everything awful about tech culture, condensed into a penis and an Arduino.
See also: a “non-ad blocker” Chrome extension that blocks all internet content except ads. Or a Dark Net wedding registry that you can only get to using the anonymized Tor browser — because Pottery Barn was blocking Tor users. Or this delightful browser extension that puts the same picture of celebrity chef Guy Fieri on every page you visit:
Are these “terrible ideas?” Does “no one need” an extension that replaces all the voices in Netflix shows with the computerized voice of a British nanny? Or a 3-D printer that only prints in spray cheese? Or a cake made out of Tums? (That last one was entered in the “Disrupting Solid Foods” category).
Well, probably. But we can still be glad that, after Saturday, these are all things that now exist in the world. And maybe we don’t need to throw hackathons in the garbage after all.
As the days grow shorter and the nights grow longer, as we scream head-on toward the winter solstice and the icescape that will surely lead to the demise of us all, there is but one light in the darkness.
His name is DJ Khaled.
Khaled is well-known worldwide (and on the worldwide web) for dispensing important success tips and inspirational techniques via social media. His 2013 album was titled Suffering From Success, but it appears that Khaled has bounced back.
When you feel that you can’t go on, just remember what DJ Khaled said: “Put this money in your savings account. Buy your mom a house.”
Are you ready to seize the day? I know I am. Carpe diem.
So I checked it out, and the answer is, no, there’s no evidence based on this incident that the U.K.’s Home Office has lumped in GamerGate with terrorist and hate groups.
I was pointed in the right direction by some GamerGaters in the comments section of a link to the article on the KotakuInAction subreddit, an unofficial GamerGate HQ of sorts. There was — credit where it’s due — a fair amount of widespread skepticism about the article among the GamerGaters there (though it did reach the front page of KiA with a red UNVERIFIED sticker next to it). Some folks mentioned having seen the pamphlet on Twitter almost a month earlier, and one of them mentioned that the author of the original tweet, Son_of_Cad, had corresponded with a GamerGate-friendly writer who might know what school this had taken place at. I DM’d that writer to ask and was told the name of the school. (The writer attempted to retroactively take our conversation off the record, but I’m not going to name the school anyway.)
Then I had a quick DM chat with Son_Of_A_Cad, to whom Yiannopoulos had reached out after his initial posting of the handout. I asked him to recount what had happened, and nothing about his retelling immediately jumped out as fishy or scammy — he said that he was pissed off about the flyer and had brought it to the school’s attention, and that the school had told him the GamerGate-terrorists connection had come from the Home Office.
So I checked, through a generic contact email, with the school itself, and received the below email from that same alias, with no name attached [sic throughout]:
So, to be clear, this isn’t a case of the British government misunderstanding and over-hyping GamerGate — rather, it appears some teacher or school administrator screwed up and/or got a little overzealous. (“I’m glad my government hasn’t made the mistake I thought it had,” Son_Of_A_Cad told me via DM after I explained what had happened to him. “I’m happy the College is planning on revising the handout, but I find it strange that they gave such incorrect information the first time round (about the Home Office’s involvement).”) The story here is way less sexy than “The British government is oppressing GamerGaters!”
It was also a very easy story to check — the school got back to me almost immediately, factoring in the end-of-their-business-day timing of my email. Son_Of_A_Cad told me via DM that Yiannopoulos “phoned [the school] up and emailed them, but I believe they never replied.” I tweeted at Yiannopoulos to ask if he ever actually contacted the school and followed up with the school to ask the same, and I’ll update this post if either responds.
Note: After I reached out to Yiannopoulos and while this article was being copyedited, I noticed that he or someone else at Breitbart had begun altering the article. First, an alleged was sneaked into the headline to soften the claim about government involvement — I confirmed this by checking an archived version I had saved earlier using archive.is. Then an editor’s note materialized at the end: “Editor’s Note: since the publication of this story, conflicting information has arisen about the source of advice to the school that GamerGate was a hate movement. We have once again requested comment from the headmaster.” Make what you will of the “again requested comment” line, but there was nothing in the original article stating Yiannopoulos had reached out to the school.
Update, 12/2: In email correspondence, Yiannopoulos told me he spoke with an administrator at the school on November 13 and that that administrator told him the GamerGate terror warning had come from “the government.” “I phoned them three times on 13 November and spoke to a college administrator who was aware of the situation,” he wrote.
Update, 12/3: In an email, the school denies it ever spoke with Yiannopoulos:
Update: Milo Yiannopoulos, the author of the Breitbart piece discussed in this article, responds below, as does the school in question. It’s not unusual for Breitbart News to publish thinly sourced GamerGate-bait or, as it shall henceforth be known, GamerBait. In fact, it’s safe to assume that part of the reason the site recently gave British commentator on gender Milo Yiannopoulos a tech vertical is because he and the site’s token-“liberal”-but-c’mon-let’s-be-real-here Allum Bokhari are so expert at hitting those GamerGate high notes — articles that sound the alarm over the extent to which “traditional” gamers and techies are under attack at the hands of social-justice warriors who have wormed their way into the tech world, hauling with them their unsavory feminist and identitarian baggage. If you want a vision of the future, Breitbart Tech tells its readers daily, imagine a lesbian stamping on your anime collectibles — forever.
I forwarded the message to Yiannopoulos to see if he wanted to respond. In an email, he said: “I was told [that the source of the GamerGate-terrorism connection idea was the British government] by whoever answered the headmaster’s line. She said what I relayed to you over the phone. Nothing to add. Sorry you fucked up so badly!”
So, depending on whether you believe Yiannopoulos or the school in question to be telling the truth, one of two things happened: Either Yiannopoulos was dishonest when he emailed Following yesterday demanding a retraction and an apology because he had discussed the Home Office claim with a school administrator, or Yiannopoulos’s source for that claim — which was stated as a fact in the article’s original headline — was "whoever answered the headmaster’s line."
Consistently painting a world in which straight white gamers and tech bros are under meaningful, sustained attack requires a slight rejiggering of mainstream evidentiary standards. Luckily, Breitbart’s proudly yellow institutional approach to concepts like “sourcing” and “facts” is a natural fit. Most sites wouldn’t publish an anonymously sourced, bizarre rumor about a women-in-tech organization allegedly setting up honey traps to seduce innocent tech guys and then accuse them of rape, for example, but Breitbart Tech found it irresistible.
Even by these standards, though, the article Yiannopoulos ran a few days ago was genuinely weird. Headlined “British Schools Are Branding GamerGate ‘Illegal’ And ‘Extremist’ Following Government Advice,” it started as follows:
There’s also a screenshot of the handout in question, and it mirrors the one in this tweet from November 9:
Obviously, if the U.K.’s Home Office were lumping together GamerGate with ISIL and the EDL, that would be a crazy story. Say what you want about GamerGate, but it isn’t chopping off anyone’s head or trying to drive dark-skinned people out of the U.K.
But there are red flags in the wording here: “According to the headmaster, says one student … ” seems to imply Yiannopoulos didn’t check with the school itself to try to get an explanation. Then: “Breitbart is not naming the college to protect the student who shared his identity with us, and because the headmaster of the school has promised to review the material.” Promised to the student, or promised to Yiannopoulos? And why would naming the school put the student in jeopardy? Nowhere in the short article does Yiannopoulos explicitly state he reached out to the school for a comment on this weird incident.
Atlanta rapper B.o.B revealed himself as a convert to the internet-beloved, celebrity-favorite conspiracy-theory belief that the Earth is flat this weekend, prompting the astrophysicist and world champion parade-rainer Neil deGrasse Tyson to explan that, well, the Earth is not flat, for reasons that have to do with physics and gravity and, you know, reality. But in the cutthroat industries of music and public science education, you can’t get away with telling a man that the world is round and not expect a response. And here it is: a diss track. B.o.B is attempting to ether Neil deGrasse Tyson.
He does not, uh, succeed. Genius has a transcript, and while couplets like “Rappers get off of my dick and get your own bars up / Now the mirror lizard’s breath got the clones scared cuz” have a certain kind of charm, the general incomprehensibility of the flat-Earth theory is difficult to get past. As is the anti-Semitism. Here’s the second verse, in which B.o.B shouts out Holocaust denier David Irving, asserts — in the manner of cranks the internet over — that “Stalin was way worse than Hitler,” and darkly implies that a Jewish conspiracy compels the president to wear a kippah.
That’s Dr. Richard Sauder, author of Underground Bases and Tunnels: What Is the Government Trying to Hide? Just as social media has revealed to us which of our high-school classmates and college friends have turned to fluoridation conspiracy and 9/11 trutherism, so, too, will it reveal to us which D-list celebrities and second-tier rappers believe the Earth is flat.
Who wants to eat an entire bag of popcorn? It’s just so filling, what with all that air. For people looking for a more sensibly portioned snack, it turns out it’s easy to pop a single kernel of corn using something you might already have in your bathroom: a hair-straightening iron.
Take a look at this video. It takes just 16 seconds of squishing the kernel in the hot iron to turn it into a delicious snack, which I assume doesn’t taste at all like shampoo or styling gel.
The video hasn’t even cracked 100,000 views on YouTube yet, but it already found its way to the No. 1 spot on the /r/Videos subreddit.
Plus, I’ve already watched it about 6 billion times this morning, so the view counter should be skyrocketing shortly.
Last week, a similar video made the rounds on Twitter, when more than 14,000 people retweeted a video of a Japanese guy making popcorn with a flat iron and then screaming maniacally at his culinary innovation. As they say: Two is a trend. (They say that, right?)
The guy behind that video told BuzzFeed that he didn’t actually eat the piece of popcorn, but that it was “insanely stiff.” Yum.
Generally used as a way for teenagers to circulate goofy videos of themselves playing pranks or horsing around, Vine is beloved by political journalists for many of the same reasons it’s beloved by teens: It’s easy, lightweight, and frictionless. Uploading a video to YouTube is a relatively arduous process, hardly worth it for a handful of seconds of footage. Vine’s brevity and expedited production process makes it easy to highlight things that might otherwise be overlooked or inconsequential — like, say, a woman reading Claudia Rankine’s Citizen during a Trump rally.
It’s perfect for highlighting slightly odd or awkward phrases that would otherwise be too short or inconsequential to notice. Hillary Clinton inadvertently became a meme this summer when a mostly unwatched Snapchat video she made went viral on Vine.
Vine makes sharing dumb moments (of which every presidential campaign has many) easier. But what makes Vine so compelling for 2016 is that it’s, well, weird. In the past, other platforms have reacted to over-memed moments like “binders full of women” with hacky parody Twitter accounts and bad Facebook-shareable image memes, Vine allows — and maybe demands — something weirder.
This joke about Trump’s facial expressions, based on the N64 game Super Mario 64, for instance, could only work on Vine. You can’t really make a parody account of Trump’s forehead. (Well, you could. But it wouldn’t be funny.)
That’s not to say that conventional gaffes, jokes, and memes aren’t omnipresent on Vine. But video editors like Berger and Dracula are doing something weirder. Their Vines are stilted; they isolate not just obvious missteps but more subtle awkward (and very human moments), finding the humor and weirdness in guaranteed repetition, thanks to Vine’s automatic looping. That they resemble the stilted rhythms of stoner-comedy duo Tim & Eric is no coincidence. Berger works with Tim Heidecker, and Dracula counts both the show and Berger himself as influences.
Just because they’re editing down external footage doesn’t mean their Vines are “factual.” They don’t just isolate six seconds of news footage and put it online. Their remix styles are somewhere in between lightly edited reality and surreal fiction. They edit clips to heighten what candidates are doing and saying, but not necessarily misrepresent them. Berger’s “Macbook Pro, baby!” Vine might not be exactingly faithful to reality — but it somehow feels more true to life than the campaign video.
If there’s a moment that’s managed to encompass Jeb Bush’s awkward, stalled-out campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, it’s “Macbook Pro, baby.” In July, Bush’s campaign uploaded to YouTube a 45-second, theoretically humanizing video of the candidate expressing his technology preferences. iPhone or Blackberry? Throwback Thursday or Follow Friday? Laptop or iPad? “Macbook Pro, baby,” Jeb responds. The video is a bit stilted and goofy, in the manner of all campaign ads ever, but it’s otherwise fairly unremarkable: A silly attempt to humanize a candidate.
Partly this is because both Berger and Dracula seek out those moments. “For the most part, I’m looking for human moments when people are being natural,” Dracula told me over email. “It’s really just a process of feeling it out and trusting my instinct.” As Berger puts it, “I’m focusing more on the awkwardness and pandering of the candidates rather than if they approve of gay marriage or not.”
For this reason, Jeb Bush has been one of Berger’s most frequent targets. At one point, Berger challenged the campaign and claimed that if the above Vine got one million views, he would get a Jeb Bush neck tattoo. (Last Thursday, CNN and Berger revealed this as a hoax. “It wore me out having to pretend that I had this tattoo on my neck,” he says. “At one point, I had a big bandage by my front door in case the local news station stopped by to interview me that I was going to use to cover up my neck.”)
Bush is not Berger’s only target, obviously. “I definitely don’t have an agenda and I don’t think my work comes across as trying to ruin the Republicans,” he says. “I mean, I do work with footage of Democrats, but there is a noticeable difference in the amount of material coming from the right versus the left.”
Dracula — a registered Democrat — agrees. “I’m just not excited about any one party or candidate. I’m not supporting a candidate at the moment,” he says. “Honestly, making these videos is allowing me to enjoy this election in a way that I wouldn’t otherwise.”
That same day, video editor and comedian Vic Berger IV uploaded his own six-second edit of the campaign video. Berger cuts out the establishing questions and leaves only three of Bush’s answers: “iPhone. Macbook Pro, baby. Apple Watch.” He ends with a closeup of the candidate giving an awkward, tight smile. Removing the space and pauses, Berger distills the otherwise harmless video down to six seconds of pure embarrassment. Looping on vine, the awkwardness overwhelms you. It’s impossible to look at Jeb Bush anymore without hearing “Macbook Pro, baby.”
The campaign’s original YouTube video has around 30,000 views and 150 comments. Berger’s Vine has 6.1 million loops and nearly 3,000 comments.
It was maybe the worst of a series of Vines that Elspeth Reeve at The New Republic wrote “showed how Bush can’t quite bring himself to put his whole heart in the humiliating campaign bullshit.” Berger has a similar feeling. “Getting in close to the face can imply something,” he told me when emailed to I ask him why he ends so many of his Vines with closeups of Bush’s face. “I think it strips away at the subject’s public image and brings more of the human side out.”
“Jeb’s original videos where I took the footage from are pretty bad on their own,” Berger says, “but by condensing them to six seconds and having some awkward closeups at certain points, it just makes it even more painfully funny to watch.”
Now that we’ve suddenly found ourselves in presidential primary season, and in the thick of an exhausting run of debates, no platform has proven more indispensable than Vine. Twitter is still the campaign reporters’ platform of choice for communicating news and quotes; some of the campaigns are attempting to use YouTube and Facebook in interesting ways. But only Vine can really capture the soul of the current election: Odd, abrupt, and depressingly entertaining.
Take Berger’s peer Todd Dracula, who mined Tuesday’s debate for TheStreet, creating a breathtaking tableau of stumbles, missed beats, overaggressive assertion, and general can’t-watch awkwardness:
A house divided cannot stand. For weeks now, Americans have been debating a key question that will decide where this nation is headed. That question is not about tax rates or social justice or military interventionism. It is about dog pants.
The question, of course, was first asked last month, in a simple but powerful drawing reminiscent of the famed political cartoons that first led our nation on its path to freedom. It is a direct and important question: If a dog wore pants, on which legs would he wear them?
In a YouTube Q&A with vlogger sWooZie today, President Barack Obama took a stand on the controversy. His verdict? That dog pants would only cover the hind legs — a show of bipartisanship as Obama tacked right. He did not hesitate in his choice. He acted with courage and conviction, rationally and definitively.
Speaking about the four-pant-legged monstrosity, the commander-in-chief said, "It’s a little too conservative."
Our president made the correct choice, of course, because we all know that front legs are arms, and do not need pants.
Super Bowl 50 is coming, and there are a lot of terrible things about it: concussions, parking in San Francisco, and that thing where the NFL keeps screwing over the guy who owns the only tape of Super Bowl I. But there is a bright side to this year’s Super Bowl: Tom Brady isn’t in it. And also, this video of Conan O’Brien playing the new Doom game with NFL players.
For this segment, Conan is joined by Von Miller of the Broncos, who’s a natural screen presence, and Josh Norman of the Panthers, who at least sometimes looks at the camera and is willing to cleverly cheat when a video-game trophy is on the line.
They blow up monsters, they taste some wine, they try to do improv, and then their party gets crashed by Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch, the NFL’s most affable character. Dude carries a late-night segment the same way he carries six defenders down the field: patiently, and all by himself.
When Beast Mode retires over the offseason, someone had better give him a TV show.
“Outrage” is a pretty good encapsulation of the feelings of hikers, campers, and outdoors enthusiasts who see themselves as the true fans and protectors of the parks. Nocket, Mr. Andre, and anyone who takes a selfie with a bear is an enemy of this first group; they are the Instagram Hikers, the largely younger group of people who stream into the parks to hit the most famous spots and post pictures of their trip on social media.
To the Original Parks People, the national parks aren’t just nice bits of the outdoors. They’re sacred, and private. “These are really special places for people,” says Casey Schreiner, the editor-in-chief of Modern Hiker. “You’ve formed an intense personal bond with these places, and when you see someone coming in and trampling it, you obviously get really upset about that.”
“A lot of the people who are sharing these photos on Instagram, or inspired by these photos on Instagram, aren’t the traditional park visitors,” says Schreiner. “So they may not even go to the visitor center; they may just drive right through, pay their entry fee, and try to find the place with the photo.” This does not earn the respect of the Original Parks People; this is lazy fandom, inauthentic appreciation of a place the Original Parks People feel a partial ownership of.
There’s a quintessential “I knew about this first” issue going on here; the position of the Original Hikers is not all that different from a fan of some small musician whose single gets featured in a movie. All of a sudden, there are people in your special place, a place you thought was only yours, and look — they don’t even know the full depth and breadth of the special place! All they know is that one thing!
This dissatisfaction tends to come out in the form of scolding, often in Instagram comments or on Yelp. The biggest instances are legitimately famous outside this world: Casey Nocket became a sort of meme scandal after leaving her paintings on rocks in National Parks, and Grayson Schaffer at Outside has been documenting the law-breaking of Instagram photographers for a while now, focusing on vandalism and the legal hinterlands regarding whether taking Instagrams for a sponsored account counts as “commercial photography.”
But more often, you’ll see scolding for little things. Taking a dog where you’re not supposed to, say. Or camping too close to water, or forging your own trail, or getting too close to wildlife to take that perfect selfie. These are legitimate problems, all; each has serious implications for the health of the environment. But they’re also an easy way for an Original Hiker to assert his or her superiority over an Instagram Hiker. If you follow or browse through enough outdoor Instagrams, you’ll find some gems. Here’s one, from a selfie one user took with a black bear: “WTF! Not a smart thing to do at all. This isn’t the cute teddy bear from the cartoons. This beast will kill you. I am amazed at the ignorance of some people.”
But the Original Parks People are conflicted, because the ethos of the parks demands that they be welcoming and open to all who want to visit the parks. They are public, after all, which is a major part of what makes them special in the first place. Everyone that I spoke to was clear that, overall, Instagram is a good thing for the parks, that getting people out there in the wild, even if they’re kind of ignorant dicks, is a good thing.
When you talk to National Parks devotees about Instagram, you usually come away with a story. Here’s one from Kathy Kupper, of the National Parks Service’s office of communications:
Schreiner told me that he thinks the primary problem is a lack of education. “There’s a big percentage of people who go to the parks who genuinely just don’t know the rules,” he says. For people who just want to see the geyser, the waterfall, the oddly shaped rock, or the perfect view they saw on Instagram, they may not bother stopping at a visitor’s center, the way an Original Parks Person would prefer. The NPS is working on ways to educate people; they will sometimes promote good behavior in their own very popular Instagram feeds, and, very rarely, point out egregiously bad behavior (as in the case of Casey Nocket).”
“From my perspective, getting people outside is always a good thing,” says Schreiner. “But then there’s that challenge of, okay, how do you capture someone who’s just there to take a selfie for Instagram? How do you show them what else is special about the parks?” And that appears to be something nobody has really figured out yet, if it even is something that can be figured out. People become fans in different ways; some people only care enough about a particular thing to hear the single, or as Schreiner calls it, “the highlight reel of a place.”
And, as Kupper notes, while the volume may be higher, the parks have always had a history of people coming just for that perfect picture. Today, it just tends to be seen by a few million more people.
“In Yellowstone, about a month ago, there was a grizzly bear feeding on an elk carcass. And a guy went almost right up to this grizzly bear to take a picture. And so literally they had to station a park ranger 100 yards away from this grizzly bear as long as it was there, which was for several days, to keep people [away], because otherwise people would keep going up to a GRIZZLY BEAR that’s in the wild eating an animal, to take a picture. I mean, they’re going with kids and things like that!”
Instagram has been a huge boon for the National Parks. The filter-heavy photo-sharing social network seems tailor-made to capture perfect vistas, crashing waterfalls, and beautiful wildlife. Many of the parks have extremely successful feeds of their own. Yosemite has over 260,000 followers. Yellowstone has over 90,000. And the Department of the Interior has over 845,000, orders of magnitude more than any other government bureau. (The Department of Labor, its Instagram strategy in disarray, has a little more than 2,000.)
Yosemite alone has been tagged in over 900,000 Instagram posts, and that’s not including the many more that forgot to use the hashtag. Many comments feature users tagging their friends and leaving a comment with some variation of “we should go here.” (Tagging someone in an Instagram comment is a sort of workaround that alerts the person you tag to the post in which you tag them.) At the same time, National Parks have experienced a huge surge in attendance over the past few years — many of them spurred, no doubt, by Instagram.
But there’s a growing dissatisfaction brewing among longtime parks enthusiasts and employees. The flood of “Instagram hikers” — the sorts of people who see a pretty photo on Instagram and want to go take their own picture in that spot — isn’t just inconvenient, it’s potentially damaging. And, as people who regard bears as a lot more than funny opportunities for selfies will tell you, dangerous, too.
Kupper told me about a particular waterfall in the Delaware Water Gap that suddenly took off in popularity among, she says, “teens, or young people” last year. “It was extremely popular so it brought all these other problems — there was trash, and overuse, and vegetation being trampled,” she says. The park had to station rangers nearby to try to lessen the flood, while, you know, not actually trying to discourage people from enjoying the parks. “Some of the rangers,” says Kupper, “had to say, yes, this is beautiful, but there are 20 other beautiful spots like this! Find your own beautiful spot!”
In October 2014, Modern Hiker broke the story of Casey Nocket, a.k.a. “Creepytings,” an artist who was discovered leaving paintings on rocks in a series of national parks. A few months later would come Mr. Andre, a French artist who posted images of his tags on rocks in Joshua Tree. Far from being appreciated for their artistry, the paintings were legally considered vandalism. The outdoors and national parks community reacted strongly to these scandals and the considerably more minor ones that followed; Slate placed the Casey Nocket story in its “year of outrage” roundup.
Despite its support for Apple in the computer company’s fight over encryption with the FBI, Amazon has quietly removed enterprise-level encryption from its Amazon Fire tablets, which run its proprietary operating system Fire OS. All of Amazon’s other devices run Fire OS, but the change only affects tablets, the Daily Dot reports. While Fire OS will no longer have data encryption, it appears that the devices themselves will continue to. According to BoingBoing’s Cory Doctorow, this means, “[i]f you run the update and then lose your device, whomever finds it will be able to see any private or sensitive information you’ve stored on it (if you don’t run the update, you won’t get patches and your device will be liable to being taken over by hackers).”
Confusingly, according to Amazon, this doesn’t mean that the devices will be less secure. In a statement, they said, “In the fall when we released Fire OS 5, we removed some enterprise features that we found customers weren’t using. All Fire tablets’ communication with Amazon’s cloud meet our high standards for privacy and security including appropriate use of encryption.”
In case you’re still doubting that such a product actually exists (I wouldn’t blame you), here’s a look at the bed in action at an event in Madrid earlier this April. The actual beds are still in the production phase, a Smarttress representative told Re/code.
All in, Smarttress sounds like a totally foolproof and cost-efficient method to find out if your partner is cheating, since people never have sex anywhere other than their own beds.
You’ve made your bed, now walk away and wait for your phone to notify you if anybody else lies in it.
This is the bold, beautiful, useless idea behind the Durmet Smarttress, a tech-enabled bed so strange I double-checked my calendar to make sure today wasn’t April Fools’ Day. (It’s not.)
Here’s the deal: The bed, which retails for a cool $1750, includes vibration sensors in the springs and sends a notification to your phone if those sensors are triggered. Smarttress will then break things down further, using a speedometer to analyze “intensity and impact per minute.”
Because that is exactly what everyone with a cheating spouse is looking for: data.
“The global infidelity crisis knocks on your door,” proclaims this Smarttress promotional video, complete with some steamy footage and a dramatic tune that can only be described as the orchestral love child of The Da Vinci Code and Pirates of the Caribbean.
According to a whistle-blowing former employee of Weibo, China’s largest social-networking platform at some 222 million active users, the Chinese government dictates exactly which posts can be published, or not, if they include “sensitive” words. “Those orders are usually clear, direct and urgent, like whose accounts need to removed and which posts need to be deleted," the former employee told the Committee to Protect Journalists. "The Cyberspace Administration of China is the highest authority to Internet companies, but even the Ministry of Agriculture has the power to order us to remove posts.” China has jailed the most journalists in the world.
While censorship on Weibo of sensitive issues — like the war of words between journalists at Southern Weekly, an oppositional Guangdong-based paper, and the government over a Propaganda Department–written editorial praising the Communist Party — has been public for years, exactly how the process works has never been made public. The whistle-blower, who worked at Weibo from 2011 to 2013, told CPJ, “The Communist Party was terrified by Weibo, staring at it with fear and the determination to tame it … The core of Weibo censorship is the lack of clear rules that users can follow. You don’t know whether you will be the next target of censorship. Such tactics instill fear in you, then you start to behave yourself. Gradually, it becomes natural not to speak your mind. Over time, you lose the ability to express yourself as a normal person would do in a free society. That is the effect of censorship in the long run.”
There are some 160 censorship employees at Weibo, according to the whistle-blower, and the work they do makes an impact. “When some mass incidents [protests or unofficial gatherings] happened, or when some political rumor was spread widely, or during the Tiananmen Square anniversaries, police harassed people based on the information we provided,” they said. Describing Weibo as a “giant fortress,” they continued, “It attracted Chinese-speaking users into the fortress, then managed them through a large team of censors and close co-operation with the government. I wonder if Chinese-speaking users would have been keener to circumvent the Great Firewall and use Twitter if Weibo had not existed.”
One of the methods of censorship Weibo uses is making a post “invisible,” which doesn’t delete it, but doesn’t show it to any users besides the one who posted it. A 2014 report from Citizen Lab, a project at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, found that this more obscure method is on the rise at Weibo, meaning that it’s unclear exactly how many, or which, posts are being censored. In 2013, a ProPublica project catalogued 527 images deleted by Weibo censors over a two-week period. The vast majority of the censored images dealt directly with political speech.
It was never going to work, but it was a brave attempt to channel some of the anticipation of a day off from school and give the weather a little help in making it happen. Lehr said hundreds of kids send tweets to the station hoping for news whenever it looks like there might be snow, but only one was bold enough to try this stunt.
When I was your age, kid, we couldn’t tweet the local news station while we were waiting for snow days. We just had to sit on our thumbs and hope for an announcement that never came. And then we’d have to walk five miles to school, uphill both ways.
As social media steals an ever-larger share of our attention from TV and newspapers, some things don’t really change. We still have the winter tradition of kids gathering around the TV to see whether school will be closed due to snow. It’s just that now, we also have kids sliding into local TV stations’ direct messages on Twitter and pretending to be with the Department of Education in an attempt to create their own snow days.
That’s exactly what happened to WTVC’s NewsChannel 9, Chattanooga, Tennessee’s local ABC affiliate, on Tuesday. WTVC wasn’t fooled by the kid prankster, but they found her attempt funny enough to send out this tweet:
After seeing several people retweet this instant classic, we got in touch with WTVC web director Dan Lehr to ask exactly how many kids tried to pull one over on the station, and what they said in their direct messages.
“We just got one DM yesterday - but that sure was enough, wasn’t it?” Lehr said.
“This DM was so obviously from a kid, there was never any doubt. Our entire newsroom thought it was hilarious. As most kids do, she used pseudonyms for her Twitter handles - I don’t know what her actual name is.”
“This is [name] with the Hamilton County Department of Education, please inform students of no school tomorrow,” the prankster wrote.
“Ha ha - nice try,” Lehr responded, “You obviously don’t know the password.”
Thank god, someone is finally providing opportunities for white people in America.
According to Russell, 1,000 people had registered for White People Meet as of this Monday.
A dating site called White People Meet sounds like a bizarre, racist joke — and it is, but it’s also an actual website where you can theoretically find a date with a white person. The site, created by a Utah car salesman and his wife, launched last week with a large billboard near Salt Lake City, and — surprise! — it was immediately controversial.
White People Meet is a weird phenomenon in that its co-founder, used-car guy Bill Russell, seems to see it as both a satire of a dating site for people of color and as a legitimate, totally non-racist business venture.
“He found himself marveling at the number of Black People Meet ads airing on daytime TV,” the Washington Post reports. “He and his wife, who technically owns the dating site, quickly became convinced both that online dating was a good pre-retirement business endeavor … and that white people faced a dearth of online dating opportunities.”
“The site” — again, that’s White People Meet Dot Com — “is not racially motivated in any way,” Russell, who “dated a black woman once,” told the Post.
As an example, he suggested his site would be “a good option” for black men looking to date white women (because they’ve definitely got a great shot with white women who’d willingly sign up for a site called “White People Meet”).
Russell insists White People Meet is about “equal opportunity” … for white people.
“I just believe it’s hypocrisy to say ‘one group can do this, but another can’t,’” he told the Post. “Equal opportunity means equal opportunity for everyone.”
Even Keller’s own Twitter poll, now answered by 14,000 people, shows that the wide-style dog pants are dumb, wrong, and utterly against nature. Nearly 80 percent of voters agree.
But, like I said, it’s post-Christmas week. Nothing is happening. And when there’s no real Dress, you might as well make your own, even if you have to make it out of rejected, misshapen, four-legged dog pants.
The week between Christmas and the New Year is perennially a time of détente in the internet “content” game. Websites publish their year-end lists and looks back, but everything new and exciting must wait to Happen until the calendar turns over. Into this hopeless gap screams a dog wearing pants! But what kind of pants? That’s up to literally thousands of people on every major social network, resigned to the idea that we’ve got nothing better to do.
The dog-pants conundrum exploded when journeyman social-media professional Jared Keller — currently working for Maxim — found the above image on Facebook and tweeted it to his 24,000 followers.
It’s now spread to Tumblr and Reddit, and has been recycled back to Facebook, much more popular than before. There’s even a Twitter Moment about it, whatever that is.
In a Maxim article, Keller traces the dog image to a Facebook page called Utopian Raspberry - Modern Oasis Machine (or “UR-MOM”). An administrator of the page claimed to have drawn the dog pic at 2 or 3 a.m. Monday, after he “saw some dogs wearing pants, and I thought about how they don’t really have arms so their pants should technically go on every leg.”
Keller frames the dog in pants as a population-dividing debate along the lines of “The Dress” — the infamous optical illusion that spawned the most popular BuzzFeed post of all time. It’s not, though: Observers were split nearly down the middle about the colors of the dress, but there’s a clear answer to this dog debate.
Every dog ever seen in pants has sported the two-legged variety. Try to imagine the four-leg garment on a human, or question how it would even stay up without suspenders. Unless you’re contemplating it at 3 a.m., like the original artist, it is absurd.
Or, as one person astutely put it on Twitter, “fuck the first option wtf.”
Thanks for the tweets. And yes, I’ve seen the picture #Crimewatch — Jason Mohammad (@jasonmohammad) February 8, 2016
When someone in his replies asked him how he held it together, he replied, simply, “I am professional.”
A true pro at work, totally unfazed. Or a secret criminal who knows he just got away with everything? Hard to say. Hard to say.
Crimewatch, the decades-old BBC TV staple that re-creates unsolved crimes in hopes that the public will come forward with new info, often runs updates on previous cases that have been closed, flashing up the arrested perpetrator’s mug shot. On Monday night’s edition, one of those updates turned extremely awkward.
The man on the left is regular Crimewatch presenter Jason Mohammad. The guy in the mug shot behind him is not Jason Mohammad. He’s Viktor Lakatos, who was previously featured on the show for assaulting an elderly person. Lakatos is now serving 18 years in prison. Mohammad, his doppelgänger, remains free and appears on television professionally. He is not currently a suspect in any criminal investigations.
The resemblance became something of a Twitter phenomenon in the U.K. after a police constable noticed it and posted a screenshot:
That awkward moment… #Crimewatch pic.twitter.com/2eINnkYJrs — PC Alice Nicholas (@KernowKop) February 8, 2016
And so did everyone else watching the show:
This presenter on crime watch is starting to sweat… - startling resemblance lol #Crimewatch pic.twitter.com/PrisLFJoaw — OkHelloYou (@okhelloyou) February 8, 2016
Is it just me or does the Crimewatch presenter look like the criminal he’s asking the public to look out for? 😳😳😂 pic.twitter.com/z75pdL4P3Y — Gusto (@GustoNBT) February 9, 2016
Eventually, Mohammad had to acknowledge what happened:
After Chelsea Peretti’s scathing performance hosting the Crunchies, the Silicon Valley awards show wherein technology blogs celebrate the millionaires and billionaires behind the companies they cover, it might be time to retire the entire concept of a Silicon Valley awards show.
For context, Peretti is a star of Brooklyn Nine-Nine and the sister of BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti. She was hosting one year after T.J. Miller, one of the leads in HBO’s Silicon Valley, had the job. Miller, who has made his disdain for real-life tech bros abundantly clear, spent much of his monologue calling the audience “bitches,” made a racist comment to an audience member, and was not invited back. So, following Miller and John Oliver before him, Peretti was the latest comedian to take on the task of mocking Bay Area start-up culture — but not enough to make the audience uncomfortable.
Peretti didn’t try. She just took their heads off.
She repeatedly mocked the Valley monoculture — the audience had both millionaires AND billionaires! — and said that instead of asking her to talk about diversity, they should have hired a nonwhite host. She called out their deleterious effects on the local population, saying that she loved what they’d done with the poor people, and that instead of a monkey, the Crunchies mascot should be a drone with a big dick, pissing on the city of San Francisco.
It was funny, incisive, and clearly made the audience uncomfortable. Hopefully it also makes the sponsors think twice about hosting an awards show for tech companies and their founders, who already get awards in the form of millions of dollars.
Uber and Facebook won Crunchies, if that tells you anything about who these are for. The Uber award was for “best overall start-up,” which raises questions about what a “start-up” is and whether words have meaning. Neither company’s CEO showed up to collect his monkey statue.
Outside of Peretti’s monologue, there was one other good moment at this year’s Crunchies: Trendy messaging app Slack won an award for “fastest rising start-up” and four black female engineers took the stage to accept it.
Klein’s outrage really picked up steam when his “SoFlo Facebook Rant” video made it to the top of Reddit’s hugely popular videos forum, r/videos, and racked up over a million views. The beef between two popular YouTubers was now a full-blown internet controversy, and SoFlo felt compelled to respond with videos of his own and threats of legal action.
His initial response was to flat-out deny being a video thief, and to claim that he licenses every video on his page — in fact, some people even pay him for the placement!
And when that didn’t seem particularly truthful to the mob calling him out on Reddit, he switch tactics and accused Klein himself of stealing videos for h3h3productions:
These clips do indeed show Ethan Klein using other people’s videos, but SoFlo cuts them off after a couple of seconds, before getting to the part where Klein parodies, comments on, transforms, or does whatever this is to the videos.
The attack fell flat on Reddit, and didn’t win SoFlo any friends.
And that’s when he apparently started sending legal threats from “investors,” threatening to sue Klein for tarnishing the valuable SoFlo brand. Klein lawyered up, working with video-game attorney Ryan Morrison (whom you may remember from the other big YouTube scandal this month, the Fine Bros. attempt to trademark reaction videos).
Here’s Klein explaining his legal situation:
Facebook has a huge and long-standing problem with freebooting, the practice of downloading other people’s original videos and reuploading them as your own, and it finally came to a head this week when one popular channel accused another of blatant, repeated video theft. Insults and legal threats were exchanged, Redditors got involved, and now, half a dozen videos and millions of YouTube views later, the dust is finally clearing.
And SoFlo responded to it with … well, this. I can’t tell whether it’s self-aware parody or some kind of sincere, school-yard assertion of masculinity, but I can assure you it is the most humorous part of the entire saga:
SoFloAntonio may be kind of a jerk, but consider that he’s also a product of the Facebook environment and a symptom of a much larger issue.
In a world where Facebook’s algorithms reward uploading a video to Facebook over just posting the YouTube original, giving native Facebook videos several times as much reach, what incentive is there not to steal videos?
h3h3productions recently had one of its videos ripped off by another page and tried to go through the process of getting the violator’s post taken down. Facebook asked him to try to work it out with the offending page directly. Even if the thief had agreed, the damage was already done.
At least on YouTube, there’s an automated Content ID system to prevent this sort of thing. That, of course, comes with its own set of problems, but it makes Facebook look like the lawless Wild West by comparison.
And, considering how much of Facebook’s revenue plan is built on video, that’s something they might want to clean up sooner rather than later.
Antonio Lievano, a.k.a. SoFlo Antonio, is a popular YouTube prank “comedian” whose Facebook page has nearly 7 million subscribers. He started out making original prank videos but has come under fire in the past year for recycling others’ content as his own without permission or proper credit.
The allegations against SoFlo have been floating around for some time, to the point that he’s become something of an internet meme. In November of 2015, another popular YouTuber, Ethan Klein of h3h3productions, started a parody Facebook page called “SoFloBro” to spoof his business model.
SoFlo apparently didn’t take kindly to being mocked. On Tuesday, Klein posted a video on the h3h3productions YouTube channel, claiming that Facebook had shut down his SoFloBro parody page and transferred all its “likes” to the real SoFlo page.
“They actually closed down our parody page, of people who hated SoFlo, and moved all of the likes to SoFlo, in a sweeping act of justice,” Klein sarcastically explained in his video.
That SoFlo himself ended up with thousands more unearned “likes” was especially galling to Klein, considering the lip service Facebook has paid to dealing with the rampant copyright infringement and freebooting problems on its platform.
Klein also accused SoFlo of pretending to give credit for stolen videos by uploading them to a separate dummy Facebook account first, then linking to that account from his real Facebook page. Klein dubbed this scheme “Facebook like laundering.”
Since Dorsey’s alleged deal with Banks was reached, he was reappointed CEO of Twitter, and Square went public. Curious. If you would also like to hire Banks to cast a spell on you, you can presumably pay her via Square Cash.
Many advances in modern technology can seem like magic — face-swapping, artificial intelligence, driverless cars, hoverboards — but few actually are. Except, uh, this.
Today, an actually (maybe (hopefully)) true story of tech-industry magic surfaced when oft-embattled rapper Azealia Banks promised to hex Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Banks says that last year she struck a deal to promote Square, Dorsey’s other company. In exchange, he was supposed to promote Banks’s new album. As far as we can tell, he did not.
Banks did really promote Square’s Cash app — a micropayments system like Venmo or PayPal — last March, but Dorsey’s #Promo4Promo has yet to materialize. Representatives for both Square and Twitter responded to queries from Re/Code with cheeky GIFs related to magic which, for your sake, I will refrain from embedding here.
Rick and Dilan are both Twitter power users, but of a sphere that rarely intersects with the more commonly covered power user of the media or tech industries. Rick spends “like five hours” a day on Twitter (“but I’m always on”), which he uses to “stalk” his “idols” — the pop singers Zayn Malik, Ariana Grande, and Selena Gomez. Dilan, who’s “mainly on Twitter” but also uses YouTube and Instagram, says she spends most of her time on Twitter if she has nothing else going on. “I’m honestly boring 😜,” she wrote me.
Except on Twitter, I guess. I asked Dilan what she made of her crude joke’s success. “I guess people just want to be me,” she said. Twitter is competitive, the celebrity-reply game doubly so. Tweet-stealing, Dilan says, is “very common.” It burns her that an obscene tweet of hers from last year (11 RTs, 28 likes), was repurposed into a hugely successful celebrity reply. When you live by attention, you die by it, too. “People lack originality,” she told me, “and I deserve more credit.”
But credit, ultimately, isn’t worth as much as 3,000 retweets. If “come to Brazil” springs from the democratizing impulse of social media — the ability of the fan to connect directly to his or her hero — the cucumber tweet is the natural outgrowth of metrics-focused attention economy. If you want people to see you, there’s no better way to do so than with creative obscenity adjacent to a celebrity tweet, like a nude cyclist drafting off a semitrailer truck. And a certain kind of attention matters most. Dilan told me that there was, maybe, another reason to catcall celebrities on social media: “So they” — the celebrities — “can see it (maybe).”
I asked her if she had anything else she wanted to say to the readers of nymag.com. “Tell them to follow me,” she said.
Twitter obeys a certain kind of gravitational law. When large bodies move through it, accumulating likes and retweets, they create waves in the gravitational field of your news feed. Smaller bodies are caught up in their wake. A reply to a celebrity or a brand can drag off its parent’s popularity for hours, collecting nearly as many likes and retweets, forming a small planetary system of its own.
There are few Twitter bodies larger than Kanye West, and none with orbits more erratic. When, on Tuesday, he unexpectedly and enthusiastically expressed a belief in the innocence of accused rapist Bill Cosby — “BILL COSBY INNOCENT !!!!!!!!!!” — he seemed to pull all of Twitter with him. (West has been frantically tweeting in the run up to his runway show, which you can see images of here.) The replies to his tweet are endless; the feelings expressed innumerable: castigation, disbelief, anger, confusion (and I’m only listing what was being expressed through GIFs of Tyra Banks). And then there was this: “@kanyewest I just masturbated with a cucumber and put it in the fridge by accident 😳 my dad is eating it.”
This tweet — we’ll call it the Cucumber Tweet to save time — seems to have struck a nerve. I reached Rick, the Colombian college student who tweeted it, over Twitter direct message (I’ve added punctuation and capitalization to his quotes for clarity) and asked what he expected from his tweet. “Nothing, LOL,” he told me. “Just 20 RTs.” Instead he got 3,000. And nearly 5,000 likes. And 600 new followers. And a multitude of replies, which he gleefully tweeted out over the course of the evening. “Most told me that I need Jesus and ‘WTF that’s disgusting,’” Rick wrote. “A lot of guys DMed me this: ‘You can do whatever you want with my cucumber.’” The tweet, by Twitter’s own metrics, has been seen 1 million times.
The practice of tweeting vulgar replies to celebrities and top accounts on Twitter and Instagram is a phenomenon that is well-known but little-understood. Beneath nearly every tweet or Instagram photo sent from a celebrity is a litany of fantastically crude come-ons, ranging from the direct and imperative (“fuck me daddy”) to the peculiar and narrative (the cucumber tweet), creating a category of response rivaled only by the infamous “come to Brazil.”
To some extent, the crude-celebrity-reply comment game is driven by humor. In September, Broadly’s Monica Heisey interviewed the teens who tweet “fuck me daddy” at the pope: “I do it mainly because it’s funny but also as like a social commentary?” one told her. “It’s just for the fun of it,” said another. Rick was similarly unforthcoming: “I did it bc is funny lol.”
I tend to sympathize with the view that tweeting rude things at famous people is, well, stupidly funny, in that stubbornly incomprehensible way teen pranks often are. But it’s also an attention-getting strategy. “People who do this are called ‘trolls,’ and they do it out of humour, and just want everyone to see,” a London teenager named Dilan told me. “By getting top reply, [a tweet] will get lots of RTs.”
Dilan, an influential fan (she has nearly 50,000 followers) of Lady Gaga and the English girl group Fifth Harmony, is the original author of the cucumber line, which she first tweeted back in August. Not prevalent or well-known enough to be properly called a meme, the cucumber line is nonetheless a repeated reply line: It appears on Twitter in replies to Rihanna and Ed Sheeran, among others. Rick, who says he lives and attends college in Bogotá, told me he first saw it on the account of a “mutual” — a Twitter friend — who no longer uses Twitter.
Ted Cruz Is the Zodiac Killer has also been a T-shirt slogan — as Tim Faust, the activist who’s raised $30,000 for a Texas abortion clinic selling the shirts, told Broadly, “I first saw Ted Cruz speak in the flesh back in 2013, when I was covering the GOP convention in Texas. He is extremely lifelike” — and it’s now also a major poll question.
Though mathematically impossible, it makes complete sense. SF Weekly came up with a few more recent unsolved murders they may be able to pin to Cruz/Zodiac, however, and as main perpetrators of the meme have pointed out, Cruz has yet to address the allegations.
This election is, unquestionably, the meme election. And now that Jeb Bush and his made-for-Vine face have dropped out, one meme is ascendant: Ted Cruz Is the Zodiac Killer.
To be clear, Ted Cruz is not the Zodiac Killer, who terrorized the Bay Area for years in the 1970s. But Ted Cruz Is the Zodiac Killer is a meme that feels almost preordained for this cartoon of an election cycle. Of course Ted Cruz Is the Zodiac Killer; why wouldn’t he be? Launched on Twitter, the meme has transferred itself to a Facebook page called Ted Cruz Is the Zodiac Killer.”
Some seemed confused:
Others just wanted the gear:
The answer to these questions always directed new users to a text file with primers on how to get started running python scripts to find ISIS presences on the web. (No word on where to buy the mask.) Another document tracked ISIS Twitter and Facebook accounts to report and get shut down.
If this was a “war,” it was remarkably clean and civic-minded. Overall — and maybe unsurprisingly — it felt like an extended orientation session for a volunteer group. Veteran Anonymous members would frequently emphasize that there was no hacking going on in the channel, which was freely accessible to law enforcement and writers like me.
Some expressed the internet’s most common exasperation:
As you may have heard, the loosely organized “hacktivist” group Anonymous “declared war” on ISIS over the weekend in a stagy, eye-catching video in which a masked man promises “massive cyberattacks.” Massive cyberattacks! How could I miss this? I embedded myself on the front lines.
All IRC channels let the moderators set the topic of discussion. #OpParis’s included, in bold red text, “No DDOS/Defacing, just collect targets!” One of the comments alongside the document of targets stated in no uncertain terms that, “If you are here asking how to hack. You shouldn’t be on here.”
The Anonymous war on terror isn’t quite as dramatic as its videos and the attendant coverage promise. No “massive cyber attacks,” just a lot of earnest people hoping to join up and help in whatever small way they could. But if the reporting is theatrical, my day in the chat made it understandable — the group has become a collective internet folk hero. Who wouldn’t want to help it take on ISIS?
The truth is, Anonymous has already been fighting the Islamic State online for over a year, in an “operation” it is calling #OpIsis. And “fighting” is maybe not the most accurate term. The conflict is mostly occurring on Twitter: ISIS is estimated to run tens of thousands of Twitter accounts as a recruitment tool; #OpIsis is an effort to get those accounts shut down as quickly as possible.
Nevertheless, what is, in effect, a public-minded anti-graffiti campaign has been covered in the kinds of awestruck terms usually reserved for Seal Team 6: “Anonymous Just Declared War on ISIS with a Massive Hack,” Mic.com declared in March after the group released a list of 9,200 Twitter accounts it claimed were linked to ISIS. To be clear: Anonymous is not hacking Twitter or Facebook in order to shut accounts down; they’re using readily available spam and abuse flagging tools built in to the social networks.
The declaration of war Mic covered in March has been followed up by an explicit declaration of war this weekend: an offshoot of #OpISIS called an offshoot #OpParis. The announcement was widely covered: “‘Anonymous’ Hackers Declare War on ISIS in Video Message,” NBC News reported. (You might wonder how many times Anonymous can declare war on ISIS before it stops getting coverage.)
The IRC channel on anonops.com saw a large influx of users over the weekend, mostly from new people who didn’t know where to start. IRC, or Internet Relay Chat, is a standardized protocol that internet users can set up themselves, rather than chatting over third-party services like Facebook or Slack; the IRC channel on anonops.com is a popular hub for members of anonymous, though far from the only one. I spent the day yesterday monitoring it.
What I saw was mostly stuff like this:
Many members were not as poetic in their declarations of support:
Ah, but what is love? Is it a feeling, an emotion, a series of thoughts? Or is it rather an action — an abstraction that takes shape in the movements of the devoted? What is love but the moment of the lover’s instinctive dive after her beloved?
The 2015 Christmas season blanketed the American landscape with hope, cheer, and hoverboards — and it took about ten seconds to lose all three of those things in a series of completely avoidable accidents. As Mike Tyson and countless others demonstrated, a hoverboard isn’t so much a gift to its owner as a gift to the comedy Vine community. But this might be the dumbest, most awkward hoverboard mishap of all.
According to one Austin Malone, his sister had only been using the board for two hours when she foolishly rode it near the edge of an in-ground pool. Hoverboard and dignity both quickly disappeared under the clear blue water as the girl futilely struggled to hold onto them. A failure, but one we can admire.
On the bright side, her brother got 20,000 likes and retweets on Twitter.
Last October, an Amazon customer had a ten-inch pink dildo called “The Hulk Huge Dong” in his virtual shopping cart. That wouldn’t ordinarily be news — it’s 2016, and one imagines people unwrap huge dongs from nondescript Amazon cardboard shells daily — but our shopper hadn’t ordered this particular dong himself. In fact, he alleged, an Amazon customer-service rep had put it there in an act of hulking, huge, pink, and ultimately impotent revenge.
Ars Technica U.K. editor Sebastian Anthony related the amusing (but also kind of creepy) tale of “Pedro,” an Ireland-based IT guy who had a bad experience trying to order a textbook on Amazon.de. After Pedro left Amazon some honest, negative feedback telling them what happened, a dildo described as “10.25 inches in length, perfect for comic book lovers” unexpectedly appeared in his shopping cart. He put two and two together: Amazon was dicking around with him.
I know what you’re thinking: There’s more than one explanation for this mystery dildo. Could it be just a bug? A prank by one of Pedro’s friends? Probably not. Ars’s Anthony investigated, and found what looks like a clear-cut case of an employee using his powers for evil (and/or comedy). After sending in a screenshot of the ominous dong, Pedro managed to escalate his case to “Executive Customer Relations.” According to Ars, he was told that the matter had been referred to the HR department to make sure it didn’t happen again.
The executive rep told Pedro he couldn’t reveal whether the prankster had been fired or put on leave, and said he “can’t really understand” how someone could do that to a customer. Amazon offered Pedro a €100 credit by way of apology, and he sent Ars a screenshot to verify that he’d received it.
Despite corresponding with Pedro and directly with Amazon, Anthony felt he still couldn’t definitely prove a low-level rep was behind the prank, but it “certainly looks” like that’s what happened.
Pedro added some additional details in the comments of the Ars story that are also worth reading. The combined text probably constitutes the most thorough investigation ever conducted into a ten-inch pink dildo that didn’t actually ship.
To be fair, she did add cheese at the end.
On her cooking show Simply Nigella this week, Nigella Lawson made a dish so preposterous that viewers are still calling her out about it days later. The dish, meant to be an alternative Caesar salad, was really just unchopped lettuce with a fried egg on top.
“Nigella faces ANOTHER backlash over her simple TV recipes as she makes a baked lettuce and fried egg dish (and even ‘burns it’)” British tabloid the Daily Mail wrote.
“I suppose this riff, in a way, is like a little culinary joke,” Lawson admits in the clip. That didn’t stop people from giving her crap online.
A courageous graffiti artist took it upon themselves to return a lost meme to Netflix headquarters over the weekend, when they approached a sign near the streaming site’s offices and appended “and chill” to the sign.
According to one Redditor who saw the tag, the graffiti is already gone. Following suspects that the graffiti was added to the company’s recently constructed buildings, but we have not been able to confirm. We’ve emailed Netflix and will update if we hear back.
There’s really very little to say about this video of three (teenaged?) dinosaur vandals jumping out of a truck and attempting to vandalize Christmas decorations before getting chased off the lawn by an old man. Watch it, love it, be it.
Below you will find the music video for “Daddy,” a new video from Psy, the Korean rapper who had a monstrous breakout hit (Stateside, at least) with 2012’s “Gangnam Style.” The video for “Gangnam Style” is still the most-viewed YouTube video ever, with more than 2.4 billion views.
Now, in 2015, we have “Daddy.” (Oppa Daddy Style.) It’s pretty nuts; there are a lot of costumes. Psy plays a small child and a senior, in addition to some sort of disco version of himself? It seems like they’re trying to recapture the magic of three years ago. Fellow Korean music star CL features on the track, with one line — “Hey, where’d you get that body from?” — frequently repeated.
Oppa Daddy Style.
Here is the hot new dance move everyone is going to be doing at the club (the one club we all go to) later this week.
Meet Munis, a Malaysian guy secretly (“secretly”) filmed by his friend and co-worker Haiikal Benot dancing in a parking lot. Munis, surprised, blows up at Haiikal before bursting into a charming smile. “Munis trying to dance like drake [crying emoji] [crying emoji] [crying emoji] [crying emoji] [crying emoji] [crying emoji],” Haiikal tweets.
It is a bravura performance start to finish, Drakeian in its meme-worthiness, and Munis has been rewarded with the greatest kind of international celebrity: the kind where you are Photoshopped into Drake GIFs.
Munis’s fame has largely spread via the actions of the mega-viral Facebook page Unilad. Today, he reached the front page of Imgur. Haiikal takes it in stride: “i dont do munis video for fame,” he tweets. “do you think i give a damn bout fame? Nehh i dont..i do it for the fun of it [grin emoji] for the fans of munis [wink emoji]” Those fans might enjoy the Munies [sic] Facebook Fan Page, which features other videos of their charming hero.
North Carolina’s horrible new anti-LGBT law, which prevents local governments from passing laws protecting the civil rights of gay and transgender citizens, has attracted attention from, well, everyone: Disney and Time Warner have threatened boycotts, and Bruce Springsteen canceled a concert in the state in protest. And I mean everyone: The porn site XHamster placed an IP ban on the state Thursday, effectively blocking anyone in North Carolina from visiting the site.
Anyone trying to access XHamster from a North Carolina IP address starting Monday is greeted with only a black screen, and site spokesman Mike Kulich told the Huffington Post that it eventually plans to replace that with a petition protesting the law.
Kulich added that this past March alone, the site was searched for “transsexual” more than 400,000 times and “gay” more than 300,000. “Hopefully, [the petition] will get as many signatures as the ‘transsexual’ searches,” Kulich told HuffPo. (“Transsexual” is a slightly outdated term, but, well, you write your statement with the porn-site searches you have, not the porn-site searches that would be respectful.)
The ban will probably reach a considerable number of visitors — XHamster is currently the 91st-most-visited site in the world, according to Alexa. “I think that porn has the power to do what Bruce Springsteen can’t,” Kulich estimated. It probably won’t stop people from doing whatever they do on porn sites, though. There are a few others out there on the net.
A new Financial Times report (subscription required) paints a “wtf” and “fail” picture of BuzzFeed’s revenue: The company’s been forced to cut its 2016 revenue target in half, from $500 million to $250 million, after missing its 2015 target by more than $80 million — nearly a third of the target figure. According to three sources who spoke with FT, the sprawling content engine generated less than $170 million in revenue in 2015 against an internal target of $250 million.
That’s not entirely unexpected (Lucia Moses at Digiday first reported that the company missed its targets in February), and it’s less a sign of imminent doom than it is of more realistic expectations. The digital-media economy has been built on a swamp of venture capital, and most people understood that there would be some settling (if not sinking) once the initial phase of construction was completed. Nevertheless, that’s a wide swing between targets, and one that could put a damper on BuzzFeed’s larger ambitions in video and TV.
The problem, according to FT’s sources, is that the company is having trouble scaling its sponsored-content operation. Unlike most of its peers, BuzzFeed doesn’t sell “display ads” — the banners and overlays you typically see on news sites (like nymag.com). Instead, it makes money by selling so-called “native” ads — posts or videos similar in tone and format to BuzzFeed’s editorial content, but made at the behest of a given advertiser, who has editorial control over the unit. “Native” has traditionally commanded a lot more money than “display,” but it’s also more resource intensive: “It takes too long to do each campaign, and you can only do so many,” one source told the Financial Times.
This is particularly true in the case of video content, where most of BuzzFeed’s resources have gone over the last year or so, as anyone who’s come across a “Tasty” recipe on Facebook has noticed. For a number of reasons, among them the enormous, young audience on YouTube and the quirks of Facebook’s News Feed, which promotes video over external links, BuzzFeed videos can attract much larger audiences than traditional posts, and BuzzFeed’s web operation has slowed as its video operation has accelerated. (Buzzfeedologists will note that Jonah Peretti, the company’s founder, moved to L.A., where “BuzzFeed Motion Pictures” is based, earlier this year; a February Fast Company profile of BuzzFeed barely mentioned editor-in-chief Ben Smith, focusing mostly on Motion Pictures head Ze Frank.)
But video still represents a small portion of BuzzFeed’s overall revenue, and as an operation it’s much harder to scale than list creation. An article takes at most a writer and an editor to create, but even short videos of the kind that have created enormous audiences for BuzzFeed require several people and a lot of time to produce. At the same time, the gulf between what actually travels well online (“Guy Best Friends See Each Other Naked for the First Time”) and what brands want to be associated with is wide, meaning BuzzFeed has trouble guaranteeing the virality potential advertisers are hoping for.
Which adds up, ultimately, to slower growth than the company, or its investors, have been hoping for. Some of that missed growth might be made up with TV deals — BuzzFeed took a $200 million investment from NBCUniversal last year — but it seems more likely that BuzzFeed will just be recalibrating its ambitions. Or maybe it’ll figure out how to make money off the 800,000 people who tuned in to watch two BuzzFeed employees explode a watermelon live on Facebook last week.
As 2015 leaves us, so too may its most popular dance moves: the Whip and the Nae Nae. The final nail in the coffin? This video:
According to the captions on one YouTube video, the White People Whip Circle kids are really “making this dance their own lol.” Indeed.
But let’s back up here. What is this stunning display, and what are its predecessors? What you see above is the nadir of a meme: “White People Whip Circles.” What is a “White People Whip Circle”? Well, here is a whip circle:
And here’s a white-people whip circle:
The “White People Whip Circle” seems to have taken off in October with this awkward performance by what looks like a high-school track team:
Is the latest and silliest video a parody of previous White People Whip Circles, or just another bad one? Thanks to Poe’s Law — that without knowing the author’s intent, parodies of something ridiculous are indistinguishable from the real thing — we can’t really tell.
For 36-year-old professional wrestler Joey Ryan, defeating an opponent with the sheer power of his penis is either the pinnacle of his career or rock bottom. Either way, the video of his … unique finishing move has gone viral, and the internet is eating it up.
Ryan has been an independent pro-wrestling staple for roughly 15 years, fighting in a half-dozen leagues — including the WWE — and more recently hooking up with upstart West Coast league Paragon Pro Wrestling, whose heavyweight title he claimed back in October. He’s also been fighting overseas, and in November, he brought his sleazy persona to Japan’s DDT Pro Wrestling league.
That’s the source of the now-infamous video, which has been viewed nearly 400,000 times and discussed on ESPN’s Highly Questionable.
Ryan explained the match to Vice Sports, for people who may not be familiar with pro wrestling. Or Japan. And according to Ryan, the crotch-grab idea actually came from his opponent, Danshoku Dino:
He plays a very unorthodox character, very homoerotic to say the least. Part of his offense is to inappropriately touch and grab opponents for the thrill of it, or maybe to throw them off their game a bit. He speaks very little English, but wrestlers can usually speak wrestling, so we understand something. So we’re going over the match and he says “Maybe I grab, maybe you no sell, because American cock so big and so strong.” So it was kind of his idea. We both play sexual characters so it fit with us.
Is the switch from iPhone to Android proving difficult for Donald Trump? After loudly proclaiming on Twitter that he was boycotting Apple products because of the company’s refusal to write software that would break into its own security system for the FBI, several typos began showing up on his Android-sent tweets, as Seth Weintraub points out on 9to5Mac.
He noted, as well, that he uses both an Android phone and his iPhone — but the switch to exclusive Android use, with its differently designed autocorrect function may be causing some embarrassing mistakes, including calling Marco Rubio a “leightweight chocker,” whatever that means. Requests for comment to the Trump campaign have not been returned.
There’s a compelling argument to be made that Rey is instead a Chosen One, much in the same way Luke was in the original trilogy.
And being a Mary Sue isn’t even an inherently bad thing, as famed nerd-culture director Guillermo del Toro explained.
The point is that a lot of Hero’s Journey stories — and really, fictional narratives in general — contain characters who become incredibly skilled very quickly. The claim some have leveled here is that people like Landis are annoyed at Rey’s development because Rey is a woman. When a male character undergoes the same arc, he receives far less scrutiny.
Landis also cited extended-universe character Mara Jade as more evidence that he is open-minded; a one-two punch that serves to establish that he supports women and is more knowledgable than everyone else about Star Wars. (Never mind the fact that Mara Jade is no longer part of the official Star Wars canon. And never mind that "Mara Jade" should never, ever, be a mic-drop moment in any argument.)
Over the weekend, a new Star Wars film was released. You may have heard. It features some of the old characters you like, but also some new ones, like Daisy Ridley’s Rey and John Boyega’s Finn. They’re all pretty good, I (and the millions of people who saw it this weekend) think. But some people disagree. Spoiler alert: for stupid reasons! (Real spoiler alert: If it’s not already obvious, I will be talking about details from The Force Awakens from here on out.)
The weird Rey-centric frustration also ignores the fact The Force Awakens includes a ton of other audience wish-fulfillment detail: Finn’s atonal giddiness at some of the film’s most dramatic moments echoes audience excitement to a very unsubtle degree (Finn: “We’ll figure it out, we’ll use the Force!” Solo: “That’s not how the Force works!”). There’s also the fact that all three new characters are stand-ins for Han Solo, an audience favorite: Rey has Han’s flying skills, Poe has his leather-jacket bravado, and Finn has his … horniness, I guess? To single out Rey is to ignore that, well, the entire movie is fan service. The question is then “Why is Rey being a Mary Sue notably worse than any other detail?” and not “Is Rey a Mary Sue?”
Some of Landis’s gripes might stem from a point he’s brought up in the past — that audiences and Hollywood value lucrative franchises like Star Wars, and ignore “original ideas” like Landis’s recent bomb, American Ultra. By the way, American Ultra was about a lazy stoner who suddenly becomes a highly skilled CIA operative after being activated by a magic phrase. Interesting concept!
The backlash against Rey, The Force Awaken’s main character, stems from the argument that she’s a "Mary Sue" — a character in fan fiction clearly intended as an authorial stand-in. Mary Sues are a fan-fic trope that dates back to when the internet was only ARPANET, and the concept is consequently a bit broad and fuzzy, but in general, the character is abnormally competent. As TV Tropes puts it, the term “is generally slapped on a character who is important in the story, possesses unusual physical traits, and has an irrelevantly over-skilled or over-idealized nature.” The male version would be a Gary Stu.
For some people, like screenwriter Max Landis — the film industry’s most profesionally accomplished 4chan user whose career is largely a result of his parentage — being a Mary Sue is bad.
Of course, Rey being excessively skilled (which she is) does not necessarily make her a Mary Sue. The specifics of pop-culture tropes are messy.
There is a very good chance that this fight will go to the Supreme Court and will dictate the level to which tech companies must cooperate with law enforcement. Understanding how an iPhone’s internal security works can help you understand this case, but it’s not essential — and will be irrelevant a few years from now, when new iPhone models have been designed and produced. Again, the legal specifics of the case are more important here than what type of chip the iPhone has inside.
The FBI is asking Apple to create a tool, to be used only on its campus, to bypass the security code and extract data. The FBI is not asking for Apple to hand the source code over, but is asking for it to be built and used. That doesn’t seem particularly invasive or arduous, but when that request is acceded to even once, it sets a precedent.
The big question that remains is then: Do technical safeguards matter if they can always be lawfully broken down? The answer is no.
Since news broke last week that the FBI was suing Apple over an iPhone owned by one of the San Bernardino shooters, many engineers, coders, futurists, cryptographers, pundits, and journalists have been asking whether the FBI’s request is even feasible.
If you are a technologist, or have any sort of interest in computer science, then the technical specifics of the case are very interesting. The FBI’s specific request — not an actual key, but a tool that lets them brute-force their way in themselves — is a very smart move. They’re asking for a hint, not the actual answer.
This has many implications for the tech industry, but those implications are, for the most part, inside baseball. The types of encryption used, the firewalls and sandboxes in place, the safeguards that prevent unauthorized access. It is both an ethical puzzle and one of engineering.
But do the tech specs really matter here? Wall Street Journal writer Chris Mims asked a related question when he wondered if legal experts were more qualified to comment on this case than the technological experts.
He’s probably right! Apple’s opposition to the FBI’s case has never really been about technical feasibility. Tim Cook stated as much this week when he wrote in a company-wide email, “it is certainly possible to create an entirely new operating system to undermine our security features as the government wants.”
The most important question that will be answered at the end of this showdown isn’t about the way the phone works (or doesn’t work) at all. It’s about the legal precedent that could be set if a tech company is legally compelled to assist law enforcement (companies already do this to a certain extent, regulating themselves so that the government doesn’t have to). The FBI says the tool would only apply to this one phone. That’s doubtful; multiple law enforcement agencies have stated publicly that they hold devices in evidence that they’d like Apple to unlock. A win for the FBI would open the door for it and other law enforcement agencies to use similar legal strategies for any device that they want to investigate.
Maybe most important, consider that while tech iterates rapidly and specifically, the law does not — and therein lies the vulnerability. Part of the reason Apple previously added better encryption to iOS 8 was so that it would not be able to recover data for law enforcement. Apple is reportedly already working on strengthening its next hardware and software iterations so that the FBI cannot make the exact same legal request for other devices. But there will be other legal requests, written in language making demands about the particular software and hardware in whatever new phones that Apple designs. The law is not selective. We can build a back door that only works for one kind of phone, but, as noted cryptologist Bruce Schneier wrote last week, “We cannot build a backdoor that only works for a particular type of government, or only in the presence of a particular court order.”
Last week, Deorick Williams got a weird text message. Someone, unknown to him, was having a baby. But Williams decided not to ignore the happy news. Despite not knowing the new parents or baby at all, Williams and his brother Dennis decided to pay their respects anyway, by showing up and bringing gifts. Wrong numbers: bringing people together since however long the telephone has been around.
What a nice gesture! Congratulations to everyone who was able to make strangers showing up to a baby’s birth very nice, and definitely not weird. You can see the entire exchange in the Facebook post below.
“[O]ur animal control officers who physically examined both Brown and her littermate found the dogs to be very well cared for, which is why we did not and could not remove them from the owner. The dogs are current on their shots, spayed, and microchipped. They are clean and well-nourished and appear to be comfortable in their surroundings. And there were no signs of injury to Brown’s muzzle, not even detectable hair loss,” Cary police said in a statement.
After police in three states received a flood of phone calls, a woman who duct-taped her dog’s mouth shut and posted a photo of it on Facebook has been arrested and charged with animal cruelty.
Katherine Lemansky, who also goes by Katie Brown, shared the distressing photo of her chocolate Lab last Friday, with the caption, “This is what happens when you dont shut up!!!” It rapidly went viral, shared nearly 400,000 times.
Tens of thousands of people tried to bring the photo to the attention of police, which turned into a three-state ordeal because it was difficult to pinpoint where Lemansky actually lived. Her Facebook page showed a South Daytona, Florida, location, but she also owns property in Connecticut (she had reportedly been on vacation there over the weekend, but went into hiding after her Facebook post wound up all over the internet.)
South Daytona police got so many calls about the dog that they had to bring in seven off-duty employees to handle the phones, NBC News reported. The switchboard eventually crashed due to the high call volume.
Volusia County, Florida, Animal Services was also swamped with phone calls; the organization had to put out a press release pleading with the mob to stop calling so employees could do their jobs and take care of other animals.
Meanwhile, police found Lemansky in Cary, North Carolina, where she was staying with the dog, named Brown. She was arrested for misdemeanor cruelty to animals, and now faces a fine and up to 150 days in jail.
However, Brown and Lemansky’s other dog weren’t taken away from her. A North Carolina NBC affiliate reports police found the pets were unhurt and seemed to be doing fine.
Former MTV VJ (and writer) Dave Holmes got, in his own words, “targeted by the laziest, shoddiest grifters I have ever come across in my life.” Some people might be insulted by the level of stupidity these con artists demonstrated; Holmes, to his credit, enjoyed the hell of it — and managed to give some important feedback. Please enjoy his story below.
New legislation in the U.K., introduced this morning by Home Secretary Theresa May, will allow the kind of dragnet surveillance that the Snowden leaks uncovered from the NSA — including police and government access to browsing history and all “Internet connection records,” which will be stored by internet and phone companies for a maximum of 12 months, reports the Guardian.
Under the draft Investigatory Powers Bill — which the opposition Labour party is said to support — police and security services won’t need a warrant to access the data. While the government is required to obtain the permission of judicial commissioners to issue interception warrants in cases of “sensitive professions” like journalists and members of Parliament, those safeguards wouldn’t apply in “urgent cases” that need to be pushed through right away — in less than five days, according to the bill.
In the announcement, May revealed for the first time that, since 1994, the government has issued “secret directions” to internet and communications companies ordering them to provide bulk data on British citizens. What’s more, the data actively prevented terrorist attacks. In other words, in many places the bill would simply legalize what the government has already been doing for two decades. “There should be no area of cyberspace which is a haven for those who seek to harm us to plot, poison minds and peddle hatred under the radar,” May said.
Privacy activists have taken their cause online, tweeting about the bill under the hashtag #SnoopersCharter. The Guardian has a breakdown of what’s in the law here.
While NSA legislation has been slow to come in the U.S., the U.K. law sets a precedent. We’re not looking at getting rid of mass surveillance, or reforming it. Instead, we’re slowly enshrining it, and giving up our privacy in the process.
Australian social-media star Essena O’Neill may have loudly quit social media in an extensive Instagram campaign, but lucky for fans she’s still posting on Vimeo (which is, apparently, not social media) through her new Let’s Be Game Changers site (which is also not social media). Her latest social-media crusade is against made-up social-media relationships — Instagram or YouTube stars who start dating only for the sake of views and fans.
The video is called “Love Gets Likes.” In it, O’Neill displays a series of draft selfies that she snapped for a “famous supermodel” she met in Thailand, who then pursued her over social media and proposed a brand collaboration disguised as a relationship. “We’d both bump up our followers,” he apparently told her, mentioning other online faux romances. “It shocked me realizing this person was only pursuing me because I had a heap of followers,” O’Neill says. That must have indeed been shocking. “I want to focus on being just my dowdy self and having someone love me for who’s inside.” Hmmm.
The video is one of a series of beyond-the-social-media-grave monologues called “Behind the Image,” in which O’Neill reveals the details of her Instagram life. “This life of effortless beauty is not effortless,” she says of a portrait shot on the beach featuring some product placement. “The necklace I didn’t even really like that much.” Watching the videos is a little like listening in on a therapy session. “I see someone that wanted more from life than images,” she says, looking at old pictures of herself.
There’s also a video documenting everything she ate for a day, as a prominent member of the online vegan community (the pumpkin soup looks good). The upload already has 30,000 views, so O’Neill certainly hasn’t forsaken all of her digital audience.
Or her digital enemies! The father of the siblings who disputed O’Neill’s definition of “fake” social media last week even made his own anti-Essena video — “ESSENA ONEILL - The REAL Behind The Image” — on Tuesday. He says the photo in O’Neill’s “Effortless” video was actually taken by his daughter. You can watch the video and more on his YouTube account, Vegsource.
FBI Chief James Comey appeared in front of the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday to, well, from the looks of it, demonstrate the FBI’s inability to maintain a consistent position on — or even, it would seem, basic knowledge of — the question of iPhone encryption and security.
Comey made a series of baffling statements, saying that Apple needs to let the FBI into their “back door” to prevent others from doing so (uh?) and claiming he’d heard from every available expert, when many say they haven’t even been contacted. At one point, the top domestic law-enforcement officer in the country wondered aloud if he should just kidnap Apple engineers and force them to write the software he wants.
He admitted, against previous statements, that an FBI–San Bernardino County decision to change the password on Syed Farook’s iCloud account was a mistake. Additionally, potentially proving that the federal government has been lying about only wanting to unlock one phone, Comey said that “of course” this case will be used as a precedent to force other technology companies to open their back doors to the government, should they win. As long as the cards are on the table, I guess.
As Representative John Conyers said at the hearing, “I would be deeply disappointed if it turns out the government is found to be exploiting a national tragedy to pursue a change in the law,” referencing an August email from Robert Litt, the top government lawyer for the Director of National Intelligence that read, in part, “[Although] the legislative environment is very hostile today, it could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement.”
The members of the Committee were, at times, openly hostile to Comey: “What concerns me … is that in the middle of an ongoing Congressional debate on this subject, the Federal Bureau of Investigation would ask a federal magistrate to give them the special access to secure products that this committee, this Congress, and the administration have so far refused to provide,” Conyers said.
Comey also said that the NSA had attempted to gain access to the phone and failed — odd because, according to iOS security expert Jonathan Zdziarski, the NSA is more than capable of hacking into the phone. “Comey’s ego has made this such a high-profile case that the NSA will not use this on a probably useless phone. They don’t want to publicize that they have these tools. If this was done in secret, they might have gotten into the phone right now,” he said in an interview conducted before the Congressional hearing.
Don’t you hate it when that happens? You’re speeding along the highway, reclining in the backseat of a car with your feet stretched out the window like an Enrique Iglesias music video, and then all of a sudden you feel a pinch on your toes. What could it be?! It’s this motorcyclist YouTuber filming himself harassing you in what will obviously become a viral internet sensation for a single day (at the top of Reddit Video, no less), but your rainbow-stockinged feet will be famous forever. Thanks, Zim Killgore, if that’s even your real name. Next time, maybe sell a sock sponsorship.
Ethan Couch, the wealthy teen whose “affluenza” defense infamously got him off with probation and rehab after he drove drunk and caused four deaths, is currently under investigation for an alleged probation violation. An anonymous tipster on Twitter posted a video that appears to show Couch playing beer pong, which would fly in the face of a court order that banned him from drinking, driving, or using drugs.
“[Y]a boy ethan couch violating probation. i got more if u want,” wrote the Twitter informant Wednesday afternoon in a tweet to the city of Burleson, Texas, and the Tarrant County, Texas, district attorney’s office.
The attached video, six seconds long, shows a beer-pong player diving onto the table and knocking it down, beer cups and all, while someone who looks like Couch watches and claps. That was enough to start an investigation, the district attorney’s office confirmed to the Dallas Morning News.
Couch, currently 18 years old, was sentenced in 2013 to ten years of probation. A year later, he was sent to a “lockdown” residential rehab facility. If he’s found to have violated his probation terms, the Morning News reports, he could face ten years in prison.
Couch’s blood alcohol level was .24 when he crashed his truck into four people who had stopped to help with a broken SUV on a June night in 2013. All four died, and two people riding in the bed of Couch’s truck were seriously injured.
He faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but Couch’s defense team argued he suffered from “affluenza,” a condition caused by growing up in a rich family that didn’t set appropriate boundaries on his behavior.
It’s recently come to light that rolling the date on an iPhone back to January 1, 1970, can turn the device into a useless brick. There’s no easy software fix, so you’ll have to take it into an Apple Store, where it’ll likely have to be replaced. But what’s so catastrophic about 1/1/70, and why would anyone set their phone to that date in the first place?
Unix, and a bunch of Unix-based software (like Apple operating systems!), express time in terms of the number of seconds that have passed since 1/1/70. That date has a time value of zero (or less than zero, depending on what time your phone is set to and what time you’re in). And that’s what seems to trigger the bug. Wired’s Brian Barrett reports this is probably the same glitch that caused Facebook to congratulate some users for being on the site for 46 years.
But most people don’t know that, so when they see a convincing-looking image meme that says changing your clock to 1970 will unlock “a classic Macintosh theme to relive the magic on your iPhone,” there’s a chance they’ll actually try it. Never mind that Apple wasn’t even around in 1970, when Steve Jobs was still in high school, getting high and reading Moby-Dick.
This hoax allegedly came from 4chan, and people have been falling for it all over Facebook and Reddit. For right now, it’s easy to avoid — just don’t change the date on your phone. But people in Reddit’s iPhone jailbreak forums have speculated that, because most iPhones are set to automatically pull the current time from a server, someone malicious could theoretically set up a Wi-Fi hotspot that would brick any phone connected to it.
No word from Apple on a fix yet.
Also not fixed is a website called crashsafari.com, which emerged in January and does exactly what it says on the tin. If you visit it from an Apple device, it’ll either crash your browser or force your phone to restart. Apple knows about that one, though, and has promised a fix in a future update to iOS.
Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Harvard say that they have developed a new system that loads web pages up to 34 percent faster, a huge boost in load times that will bring load speeds from a few seconds down to, uh, a smaller amount of time.
Reducing page-load times has been a perpetual carrot on a stick for web developers; a task that requires balancing constantly changing hardware, software, and network limitations in order to optimize performance. Products like Facebook’s Instant Articles and Google’s AMP are the latest in a line of products meant to sell websites on the idea that shorter load times equals longer engagement.
Many recent efforts to reduce load times center on compression, reducing file size to ease the transfer of data. “Polaris,” as the researchers have dubbed it, takes a different tack, instead mapping the dependencies of a web page. Dependencies are separate files that contain other aspects of a web page. They’re generally CSS and JavaScript files that determine how a page looks or functions.
Current web pages process dependencies inefficiently. One of the researchers involved, professor James Mickens used a traveling salesman analogy:
It might be helpful to think of dependencies as ingredients on a shopping list. In the current mode of page-loading, that shopping list doesn’t exist. Say you’re making chili, so you go and buy some ground beef. You go back home. Next recipe item is a can of beans. You get that, return, and your recipe says, “okay, open the can.” So you drive to buy a can opener. Next, go pick up some onions. And so on and so forth, to and fro. That’s how web pages load, like making the world’s cruddiest chili.
What Polaris does is compile all of those dependencies into a graph, a single map for fetching objects more efficiently. Its creators have found that its “gains on load-time are more consistent and more substantive” than the more popular method of compressing data, reducing network activity instead of bandwidth requirements. I’m not sure what that means for chili though.
Last week, Gruber’s wife, Amy Jane, responded by tweeting email headers that seemed to show that Samantha Bielefeld was really Victor Johnson, a peripheral tech-scene figure, sometime podcaster, and alleged con artist. Amy Jane also noted that a footer on Bielefeld’s blog (“Most Rights Reserved, Some Are Very Outgoing”) copied the same joke Johnson had made on his own blog years ago.
The allegation was troubling for a couple of reasons, one of which was that Bielefeld had written about the toxic environment women in tech faced, and it now seemed that writing wasn’t based on personal experience.
Another: As evidence that she was being harassed over the opinions on her blog, Bielefeld had presented a horrid, vitriolic email that called her a four-letter C-word and suggested she kill herself. The sender? One Victor Johnson.
The Grubers had apparently been suspicious for some time. In August, before Bielefeld’s blog had even launched, John Gruber tweeted a cryptic message that turned out to read: “I think Samantha Bielefeld is not who she claims to be.”
Even the argument about app pricing that propelled Bielefeld to niche internet fame might not have been her own: Michael Johnson of Building Twenty points out that he made it a day earlier, and claims that when he emailed Bielefeld about the similarities, she admitted his posts had “prompted” her own.
Initially, Bielefeld denied on Twitter that she was truly Victor Johnson, and promised refunds to any subscribers who wanted them. But on Monday, Scottish security researcher Alex Waddell published a post on Medium thoroughly dissecting the evidence and concluding, “I can very confidently say the following: Samantha Bielefeld IS Victor Johnson.”
Bielefeld cleared out her entire Twitter timeline shortly afterward. Reached via email, she declined to comment about the controversy that surrounds her, but wrote that she’s “currently working on a blog post of my own.” Hours later, she confirmed on Twitter that she plans to publish by the end of the week.
If Bielefeld is actually a man posing as a woman, Tiffany Arment — wife of Marco — argued in a post on Medium on Tuesday, he’s making the already difficult position of women in tech even more difficult.
Apple-focused technology blogger Samantha Bielefeld arrived on the scene in mid-September, with a debut post on her personal blog that criticized the tech blogosphere as “without a doubt dominated by journalists who are men.” She promised, as a small corrective, to “increase the number of women adding their insights, by one.”
“A man is able to opt into abuse. If the abuse received was fabricated, that is an even more painfully egregious offense. But even if the abuse is real, he is receiving the abuse willingly. He can opt out when he’s had enough,” she wrote.
“Women can’t turn it off. It’s our daily lives.”
Funny enough, the top Google result for “Bielefeld” is the Wikipedia page for the Bielefeld conspiracy, an internet urban legend that the town of Bielefeld, population 300,000, doesn’t really exist. It’s quite a brilliant choice for a pseudonym.
Bielefeld claimed she was writing under a pseudonym to protect her career, but over the past two weeks, a number of prominent tech bloggers and commentators have claimed her pen name was hiding something else: that Samantha Bielefeld is actually a man named Victor Wynn Johnson. And there seems to be ample evidence to prove it.
To explain why anyone cares, let’s back up to October, when Bielefeld found herself at the center of the first big controversy of her short blogging career.
She had published a post criticizing prominent app developer and podcast host Marco Arment for changing the business model of his podcast app, “Overcast,” to a donation-based “patronage” plan rather than a one-time paid download.
She argued that patronage only worked for Arment because of his prominence in the Apple community and the wealth and fame he accrued as an early employee of Tumblr. Arment could afford to make his app essentially free and rely on the goodwill of his fans, pillaging market share from competitors who couldn’t afford to do the same.
Whether the argument was valid or not, it caused a minor internet tempest. Arment responded calmly, some of his fans got angry, and everyone debated app-store business models for a week or so. Samantha Bielefeld, a prominent new female voice in the Apple blogosphere, had arrived.
She’d built up enough of an audience that she started offering “memberships” to her blog for a few bucks a month, with extra content promised to subscribers. It complicated her argument about patronage a little bit, but that only made her more interesting.
But in November, she seemed to fly off the rails. She tweeted the phone number of arguably the most influential Apple blogger of all time, John Gruber — albeit with the last three digits x’d out.
Over on the Adblock forums some users are reporting that, upon logging into Yahoo Mail earlier today, they were greeted with the above message, asking them to disable their ad blockers. If Yahoo decided to expand this effort, it would be an escalation of the growing tension between ad blockers and the companies that depend on ads to survive.
As Digiday points out, this tactic is also becoming increasingly popular among media companies. A growing number of websites have developed tactics specifically to reach out to users, replacing blocked ads with requests for users to white-list them (allow ads on certain domains) or subscribe. But media sites, which display their own content, are different from services like Yahoo Mail, which function as a third-party go-between. The idea of forced disabling of an ad blocker is different and less palatable if, for example, you’re trying to access a personal email from Grandma.
The issue does not appear to be a glitch, as part of the block’s URL structure includes the explicit string “reason=ADBLK_TRAP.” I was able to visit the error page, but was unable to replicate the actual block on Chrome and Firefox running Adblock Plus. I logged in without a hitch.
Justin Trudeau, tarnished.
Do you like Justin Trudeau? I do. Admittedly, I don’t know much about him or his policies but he seems nice. He certainly gets along well with President Obama. The fumes of their bromance this week were so strong, in fact, that they reminded some of the show Scrubs.
Now, whenever I see Justin Trudeau, all I can think is, That guy looks like Zach Braff. Great, that’s just what I needed: more reminders of Zach Braff.
Okays, aligned.
Everything about this chart is correct.
Two children dancing.
Congrats, to both of these kids, who have great moves.
There’s tons of great stuff happening online every day. Even right now! While we try to get most of the good stuff, things occasionally slip through the cracks. Or maybe they just don’t need an entire blog post unto themselves. Blog posts are, after all, a finite resource, like oil or helium. There are only so many. What follows are some of these good things.
The voice of a generation.
It happens to the best of us. We log online and think, Today’s the day. Today, I will have a productive discussion about politics on Twitter. This happened to writer Vann R. Newkirk II on Tuesday when he inadvertently got caught in the midst of a conversation between activist Shaun King and musician John Legend. Eventually, the cross-talk became too much.
“untag me I want out.” We’ve all been there.
Thing explodes.
A propane tank in Crocker Park exploded but apparently nobody was injured, so it’s totally okay to enjoy this vine.
Best of luck to Mr. Galloway on his campaign.
British politician George Galloway, the leader of the U.K.’s left-leaning Respect Party and London mayoral candidate, has always had a weird online presence. His Twitter account is a well-known peculiarity, mostly because of his itchy trigger finger when it comes to blocking people. He name-searches (a thing some people do to find others talking about them without mentioning their @ handle) and blocks people preemptively. If you specifically write to Galloway online and ask to be blocked, he will probably fulfill your request.
Galloway’s latest tactic, for some reason, is to append a picture of himself to all of his tweets. The picture appears to be digitally zoomed-in. I don’t know why.
When U.K. Twitter discovered Galloway’s striking new strategy, photos of the behatted candidate flooded the service.

A national organization of fraternities is formulating Version 2.0 of its public-relations plan to “advance the fraternity brand,” but there’s a major challenge in their way: fraternity members. Specifically, fraternity members on social media. A white paper from the North American Interfraternity Conference, obtained by the Huffington Post, laments the rise of “popularized social media platforms that damage the industry by glorifying ‘frat’ culture.”
Frat-themed websites and Facebook pages like Total Frat Move have exploded over the last few years, bringing us the latest and greatest in videos, photos, and stories of stupid college students doing stupid things. But is the problem the people “glorifying frat culture” — or frat culture itself?
NIC officials didn’t immediately return an email seeking clarification, and they told the Huffington Post Tuesday night that it would be “premature” to comment, as the NIC’s plans for reform are still being revised during meetings in Texas this week. So we asked Total Frat Move, perhaps the internet’s leader in “glorifying ‘frat’ culture,” what they make of NIC’s comments. Total Frat Move’s vice-president of media, Ross Bolen, said in an email:
NIC has been around since 1909, but it’s certainly not universally beloved among fraternities. It represents 73 of them, but at least one has left in the past year, out of concern over “counterproductive tactics.” In 2015, NIC was best known for pushing the Safe Campus Act, a GOP-led bill that, despite its name, would have made it harder for colleges to investigate and punish perpetrators of sexual assault. Eight sororities came out against the bill, forcing NIC and the National Panhellenic Conference to back off and support the very similar Fair Campus Act instead.
It’s not clear from the NIC whitepaper whether the organization blames social media for the failure of the legislation it spent all year trying to boost, but the organization does seem to believe fraternity members can’t currently be trusted on the internet.
“We acknowledge that these problems are often caused by some of our members’ inability to self-govern and adhere to basic membership expectations,” the whitepaper says.
The organization’s top priority is still a strong “ground game” that will target specific campuses and improve their frat culture — making it more marketable and PR-friendly — but if they’re unsuccessful in getting members to stop doing stupid things, they’d like to at least stop them from tweeting, Facebooking, and Snapchatting it.
Oleg Cricket is a man with a dream.
“I was born in a small city in Siberia. I grew up in a loving family with caring mother and awesome father, being a little boy with ambitions and a dream which only I believed in,” the Russian-born stuntman explains on his website, which greets visitors with a charming motivational quote from Mark Twain and a nondescript hip-hop tune that plays until you finally rip out your headphones.
Now, after seeing this video of Cricket riding a hoverboard atop a skyscraper in Dubai, we’re pretty sure we know exactly what that dream is.
Take a look. Cricket performed the stunt earlier this month, but the video is just now making the rounds on Facebook after being picked up by the LAD Bible, where it has been viewed over 3,000,000 times.
“scENE fROM My fULL vIDEO, HOW AM I sTILL ALIvE? I DON’T KNOW, MAyBE I’M IMMORTAL?,” Cricket very coherently captioned his video on Instagram. He also included three hashtags: #NoPhotoShop, #OlegCricket, and #KanyeWest. Well, there you have it. Cricket’s childhood dream was to scare the ever-loving shit out of us.
Visitors’ fascination with Portal of Evil exhibits always seemed to trade in equal parts on physical and moral disgust. There’s a term that people use for trips to places like Auschwitz and the site of the World Trade Center towers: atrocity tourism. That phrase was adopted by the furry community — itself a frequent topic of Portal of Evil discussion — to describe what we did at our website. Visitors could climb out of their lives for a few minutes to gawp at the truly disturbing, then go back to normal with no harm done.
One former visitor thought that the power of the disgusting could be explained in two ways: “It really does make you feel better about your life. I remember there was that really weird-looking guy who wore diapers and just pissed all over his Looney Toons stuffed animals. That was how he got off, sexually — dressing like a little boy and peeing all over icons of his childhood. I felt way less gross about being something as boring as gay in comparison to that.”
In a way, that was true for me. When I created the site, I was living in a five-by-nine room in a New York City apartment with a guy who cleaned every surface with ammonia twice a week like he was practicing for a crime scene. I hadn’t kissed a girl since moving to the city and ate crullers on a daily basis alone in my bunk bed. My life was disastrous, but these peeks into something worse kept my head above water, both financially and emotionally.
“I was weird and felt like I was the only weird person on earth,” the user told me. “I didn’t even know anyone else who played computer games, let alone really cared about 19th-century metaphysical sex cults … People are fascinating, and extreme people are extremely fascinating.”
What we present online is, typically, our best facets — we skim over food service on LinkedIn and leave the Ke$ha off of our public Spotify playlists. But what was interesting about the people we featured on the site was that they refused to do that. They put every inch of their fetishes, perversions, and inner mysteries out for the planet to discover.
Of course, that’s little comfort to the people who were angry to be featured as unreasonably weird or gross. Some bombarded us with irate emails and lawsuit threats (none of which ever made it to court). One woman, who wrote reams and reams of Secret of NIMH fanfiction, even encoded a Wiccan spell into the HTML of her web page to put us under some ill-defined curse.
But others embraced it. A significant part of our traffic, after all, wasn’t from gawkers looking for somebody to cringe at. It was from other perverts and freaks who browsed the site unironically, connecting with people who were just like them. One of the best moments I can remember was when “Grandpa DeSade,” a cheery bearded sadist who resembled Santa Claus with a bullwhip, showed up on the forums to talk about his lifestyle with the regulars.
Eventually, I began to move away from the site. A feeling of lethargy crept up every time I looked at another furry living in plush-lined squalor, another foreskin stretched over a Perrier bottle, another incest web-comic. I worried I was becoming too accustomed to the horrible things I was publishing online.
A man stretching his anus horrifyingly wide with both hands. Two young women defecating into a cup and then messily eating their own waste. Lovingly rendered artwork of Japanese anime babes being filleted into grisly ribbons. For over a decade of my life, this was how I paid my rent. In Manhattan.
I raised this possibility with Dr. Strohminger recently — the idea that, as a culture, we are starting to become inured to disgusting things. She disagreed. “Hundreds of years ago, people attended executions for entertainment. The thought of watching someone be killed is beyond the pale for most people. I’d resist the notion that we’re becoming less sensitive to disgusting things.”
She wasn’t wrong, even in my case. I was maybe less sensitive to the immediate sight of the disgusting, but I was getting more sensitive to the ramifications of what I was doing. In 2005, users of the site took a concept album written by “the DragonGuyver,” a prematurely balding amateur philosopher in Maine, and put all of the lyrics to music, even getting some of the songs played on the radio; others Catfished an NYC slam poet into sending dick pics and showing up for a fake date. Stunts like this felt too far, and I started to move away from the site.
Chet was working at a video-game company and getting annoyed when former Portal of Evil exhibits would harass the receptionist, trying to get him fired. I was about to leave New York to live quietly on a small island in the Pacific Ocean. I’d been looking at the worst humanity had to offer for 12 years, but now I had other things in my life besides the disgusting.
Sort of. In 2007, before I left the city, I saw maybe the most disgusting thing I’d ever actually witnessed in person: my son being born, cut squalling from my wife’s Caesarean midsection, in a grisly tableau worthy of a website of its own. And out of that morass of gore, a perfectly formed baby boy whom I instantly fell in love with.
I’m not going to argue that there’s something that beautiful in the heart of everything disgusting. How could there be? But if you look hard enough, what you find might surprise you.
Or get you on a FBI watch list. Either way.
10 Favorite Portal of Evil Exhibits That Are Still Online
While many of the sites we featured have faded into bitrot, some are still up and running. Here are ten survivors.
Disgust has a long and proud evolutionary history. It has the power to draw and heighten attention, developed as an evolutionary warning system to keep us from endangering our bodies. One of the leading theories in evolutionary biology postulates that we learned to feel disgust as a defense mechanism to keep us from eating rotten food.
Boston and Shaun
http://www.bostonandshaun.com/
Painfully naïve web-comic about a young boy and his pet dragon who eats him. This curious exploration of the fetish known as vore is all the more unsettling because it appears to be created by a child.
Cockrub Warriors
http://man2manalliance.org/
Postulating a “new concept of heroic M2M,” this site is run by gay men who reject anal or oral sex in favor of rubbing dicks against other dicks.
Waita-Uziga’s Deadly Joy
http://uziga.sakura.ne.jp/
One of the first guro, or Japanese gore-art, sites we ever featured. Uziga’s intensely detailed artwork is still incredibly nauseating.
Madame Guillotine
As the risk level of human existence has steadily dropped, the feeling has metastasized into something quite different — and yet disgust can still instill a sense of urgency perfect for the internet age: A 2014 study from the University of Florida indicated that we’re not only more likely to give our attention to disgusting things, but also to share them with others.

Our first exposure to “object sexuality” came courtesy of Eija-Riita Elkof, a Swedish woman who was engaged to be married to a guillotine she named Fressie.

A young man from Texas with profound obsessive-compulsive disorder, Ulillillia was beloved on POE for his thorough documentation of his mental activities (and the fact that he dropped by the site to talk about his imaginary friends).

A seminal tale of anthro degeneracy, this page chronicles the adventures of a Belgian furry who begged his way into a shared house and then claimed that he had a heart condition that would kill him if he didn’t have sex.

But I don’t need a study to tell me that disgust is highly shareable. Between 1999 and 2011, I owned and ran a site called Portal of Evil. Over that decade and change, my business partner Chet and I drove millions of page views to disgusting photographs, obscure fetishes, insane conspiracies, and things that beggared description.
Plenty of weird porn sites made their way to Portal of Evil, but this one — dedicated to ladies vacuum-pumping their vulvae to massive size — is still pretty unsettling.

Imari Stevenson wanted to make a video game called Eternal Destiny Conquest that would span 80 CD-roms and feature women shooting laser blasts out of their nipples. It never happened, but he has produced a number of utterly bonkers short films.

Some of the most iconic Portal of Evil exhibits were the most banal. Ben Schumin posted photo essays of his trip to Walmart, wrote dismal love poetry, and obsessively documented every fire alarm known to man.

These obsessively rendered erotic comics dependably take a turn to their female leads being murdered, roasted over an open flame, and eaten. And there are hundreds, if not thousands, of pages of them.
Let me try anyway, though: a lady who wanted to chop her hands off and replace them with “twin Dorrance stainless steel No. 5 hooks.” Another woman who chemically castrated her husband without his knowledge and wanted to tell you how to do it, too. An ordained priest who went into deep detail about his love of having sex with dogs. And thousands more unique and terrible exhibits. (Below this essay, I’ve included a list of some of our visitors’ favorites.)
Nina Strohminger, a psychologist working at Yale, proposes a category of revulsion called hedonic disgust, in which the experience of the negative emotion actually makes a positive one more powerful. In an experiment she describes in her doctoral dissertation, “The Hedonics of Disgust,” test subjects were given “primer sentences” designed to trigger disgust (like “The sewage is green”). They consistently rated New Yorker cartoons funnier than a control group that did not receive the primer sentence. (Imagine how funny they’d have found the cartoons if they’d watched “Two Girls One Cup.”)
When I talked to Strohminger, she told me that psychologists only started being interested in disgust over the last few decades. “The field thought that it wasn’t an emotion at all. It was seen as a bodily state,” she said. But once we started to draw connections between disgust and moral behavior, and find the similarities between being physically repulsed and judging a morally reprehensible act, the field of study began to open up.”
Posting the Bee Movie script and forcing people to scroll all the way through it has become something of a tradition online, a wonderful and irritating way to exploit the feed as the dominant mode of consuming content on your phone. On Tumblr, users message it to each other as a prank. One friend of mine and a Bee Movie acolyte said she was unsure whether it originated on Tumblr or 4chan. Regardless, the tag for “bee movie script” on Tumblr is thriving.
Now, you can experience the sensation of scrolling through the entire Bee Movie script yourself, because I have posted it below:
(This post has been updated to clarify that the entire Shrek franchise, as opposed to only the first Shrek film, is bad. Shrek (2001) is extremely good.)
Over the weekend, the Facebook page Bees Don’t Exist — devoted to advocating for the novel and scientifically controversial position that bees, the species of insect, do not exist — posted a new “life event.” The life event is not a birth, nor a wedding, nor a new job. It is a full transcript of the 2007 Dreamworks animated film Bee Movie. And it has been shared 3,800 times, infuriating the friends of people who shared it on the social network.
The film — Jerry Seinfeld’s first big project after the end of his sitcom — stars the comedian as Barry B. Benson, a bee who sues the entire human race for stealing honey. He also falls in love with an adult human played by Renee Zellweger. In the pantheon of “bad children’s entertainment ironically beloved by people who use Tumblr,” Bee Movie ranks slightly below the Shrek franchise.
The above post looks fine on Facebook on a desktop computer. It’s a short block of text, cut off after 100 or so words. But viewing Facebook on a mobile app or in a mobile browser tells a different story. Well, actually, it tells the entire story. Of Bee Movie.
Commenters on the post generally find it funny, find it bewildering, or find it frustrating (because the post is so lengthy that it is causing their app to crash).
Every once in a while, there are those perfect days. You’re on top of the world. Everything’s gravy, nothing can go wrong — you’re unstoppable.
Out on the blacktop at recess, the calls for you to bust a move reach a fever pitch. Immediately — instinctually — you start to groove. There’s no music but regardless, the rhythm and the movement flow through you like a mighty river. You throw in a Dab here, a Superman there. The crowd is going nuts.
But not all days can be like this. On other days, the rhythm is off. You’re not feeling the music. The best you can do is a frantic Bees’ Knees, a dance most famous in the present day for its appearance in the classic cartoon short “The Skeleton Dance.”
Sometimes you are the Dabber. Sometimes, all you’ve got are the Bees’ Knees. Such is the coin toss we call life. The most important thing is enthusiasm. If the only move you have is the Bees’ Knees — do the best Bees’ Knees the world has ever seen.
Making a Wi-Fi password is hard work. It’s gotta be easy to recite, so that guests aren’t constantly bugging you about it, and it’s gotta be something other than “password.” One easy solution is to just make it your name, or maybe your first initial and your last name. (Not that that’s my Wi-Fi password.) This is a bad way to do it:
A lot of ISPs nowadays just give you a router with the network name and password already assigned, which is kind of annoying but here’s a little lifehack: You can swap out the router if you want. It’s pretty easy, there are some tutorials online. Just get a wireless router and then head to Google.com and type “Wi-Fi network setup” into the box and hit the Enter key.
A day after Instagram-star-turned-socia-media-critic Essena O’Neil warned the world that the social-media relationships are often fake, a new relationship is taking the Brazilian viral internet by storm. Should we be suspicious? Or should we trust the reality of this young woman’s friendship with a potato she dressed up in clothes?
BuzzFeed Brazil brings us the story of 19-year-old Roberta Bernardo and her potato. (“Bernardo said that the potato’s name is ‘Potato,’” BuzzFeed writes.) Bernardo’s Facebook post about Potato, whom she found at a supermarket …
bathed in the sink …
and dressed up in pink …
has received thousands of shares and likes. “She is richer and more powerful now,” Bernardo tells BuzzFeed. It is only a matter of time before Potato calls out Essena O’Neill on YouTube and stars in a movie with Nash Grier.
This is ethics, as in Gamergate’s rallying cry, "ethics in gaming journalism."
Logic:
Memes:
Brony:
Swag (light blue) vs class (dark blue):
As a community, the users of the link-sharing website Reddit don’t like to be pigeonholed. But they have been: argumentative, nerdy, atheist engineers. Accompanying that sterotype is a certain vocabulary: bacon, atheism, fedora, brony.
Fedora (light blue) vs. Trilby (dark blue):
But what if Reddit is getting … better? Using this handy n-gram viewer over at FiveThirtyEight, you can now track the popularity of certain words over time. (The X axis represents time; the Y axis the frequency with which a certain word is used.)
Look at, for example, at misandry, the supposed male equivalent of misogyny. We can fairly assume the word is used sincerely on Reddit more often than it is used ironically, and it is, cheeringly, being used much more infrequently over the last couple years:
Here’s atheism — the subject of what was long one of Reddit’s most popular and argumentative subcommunities. It’s clearly heading on a downward trend as the site gets larger and more tolerant. (The spike at the end of 2011 might be from a charity drive in which r/atheism raised money for Doctors Without Borders, or it might be from this scorching blog post, "Reddit Makes Me Hate Atheists.")
Here’s Dawkins, as in Richard, r/atheism’s high priest:
Fan fiction is not real life. But “made-up” has never stopped U.K. tabloids, which published a made-up text exchange between two characters on CW’s apocalyptic soap opera The 100 as if it were a charming incident that happened IRL.
Ryan Broderick points out that the source for a heartwarming Star and Daily Mirror story about a dog named Fish is actually a The 100 fan Tumblr. The made-up text exchange imagines two characters, Clarke Griffin and Lexa, texting about buying a dog (the slash relationship is called “Clexa,” in case you were wondering). Lexa, the show’s Commander of the 12 Clans, says she’s going to buy a goldfish, but then buys a fluffy dog instead! So cute. But not a real thing that actually happened to real humans.
The texts first went viral on Facebook in a degraded form, stamped with watermarks from Samy Irssak. They gained over 830,000 likes, the tabloids jumped in, and followers started to identify themselves as #clarkethehusband or #lexathewife — the stereotypical cranky dude or the flakey woman. Hmmm. This is, as they say, "problematic": The characters the texts were originally assigned to are both women.
Of course, the show’s fandom then rushed to respond, further meme-ifying the meme. The slash never ends.
Right now, nearly 500 people have “liked” a comment under a post about Mizzou student protests on the page of the conservative morning show Fox & Friends. What could receive such a ringing endorsement from die-hard conservatives? “Hit ‘Like’ if you wish you could drink Obama’s pee out of a cup made from Ted Cruz’s skull,” the comment currently reads. Hmmm.
The apparent enthusiasm for drinking the president’s urine is the result of a very funny and very simple prank. The author, Karen Lorde, is not actually the Grumpy Cat–profile-pic-sporting conservative that she appears to be. She is the creation of Twitter users @LRonMexico and @dankmtl, who are using Facebook’s edit feature to troll Fox News viewers.
Facebook now allows users to edit their comments, allowing someone to, for example, garner a bunch of "likes" with pro-conservative sentiment and then change their message to a left-leaning one. Facebook leaves a paper trail of comment-edit history, though it’s slightly buried. Here are the many things Fox & Friends fans have unwittingly endorsed over the last few hours:
Now that they’ve racked up enough “likes” to reliably maintain the top-ranking comment slot, @LRonMexico and @dankmtl are free to change their comment to whatever they want it to say.
Is there any group of people more resourceful or committed to the exploration of the artistic boundaries of their hobby than gamers? The hotly anticipated Fallout 4 has mostly been a buggy disaster, but it has produced at least one excellent meme: Making famous people in the character creator. Above, the so-far pinnacle, a nearly perfect Vladimir Putin. Below, Putin’s video-game equivalent, Waluigi. Kotaku has more, including an eerie Hulk Hogan.
A Hollywood hospital is keeping all of its records on paper this week, after hackers rendered its computer systems unusable and demanded a multi-million-dollar payment to fix the problem. Ransomware, an extortion scheme where hackers encrypt all of their targets’ data and essentially sell it back to them, has become increasingly common over the past few years, but this might be the most extreme case yet.
Employees at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center said the hackers are asking for $3.4 million in Bitcoin. The FBI and Los Angeles police are investigating, but, in the meantime, things at the hospital have slowed down tremendously. Some patients have been transferred, and others have been told to pick up their medical test results at other facilities.
Medical centers and dentists’ offices in Australia have been hit by ransomware gangs — believed to be Eastern European and thus difficult to trace or prosecute — over the past couple of years. In most cases, the hackers keep the ransom low enough that it’s cheaper for targets to pay up than to hire expensive IT professionals to attempt to fix the problem. And that’s if it’s even fixable: Without a key, modern encryption can take years to break.
The typical target for CryptoLocker, probably the most widespread form of ransomware, is an individual internet user who will likely pay around $350 to unlock their data. Or won’t bother to pay at all, which is why scammers typically aim for a huge number of small scores instead of one big one. For some reason, Australians are popular marks. In 2015, 2,500 Australians were taken for a total of around $400,000 — and those are just the victims who bothered to file reports.
All of which is to say that targeting a large U.S. hospital and asking for millions of dollars is a wild new development in the spread of ransomware, and that high-value targets like hospitals and government agencies would do well to keep backups of all of their data on internal servers that are not connected to the internet.
Update: The hospital said Thursday that it paid 40 bitcoins (around $17,000) to the hackers in exchange for the decryption key. Local news reports claiming the ransom was $3.4 million were incorrect, the hospital’s chief executive wrote in a memo.
As Donald Trump, GOP presidential front-runner and slapdash drawing by a child who only had an orange crayon, continues to lead in the polls with just months until the Iowa primary, there’s a growing sentiment among his detractors that it’s time to start treating him as a serious threat to win the presidency. To them, Donald Trump is no longer a joke. One can only assume those people haven’t seen this GIF:
Trump without a nose, looking for all the world like a vintage Señor Wences character, is the brainchild of multimedia artist Jeremiah Warren. His inspiration apparently came from the “no nose” meme, which peaked in 2013 and inspired a Reddit community with 17,000 subscribers.
Some of the older submissions were funny, but Warren’s Trump GIF is easily the no-nose genre’s most significant achievement: It’s turned a divisive billionaire credited with reenergizing white supremacists into a harmless hand puppet and made an old meme great again.
Here’s a nice reminder that not every new Twitter feature demands an enormous, multi-day freakout. Today, the social network announced a new feature in its mobile app aimed at a community that often goes ignored by tech companies: people with disabilities. For the benefit of visually impaired users, Twitter now offers the ability to add alt text to images uploaded to the service.
You’ll be familiar with alt text if you’ve ever hovered over an image on a major publication’s website; it’s that small text box that pops up after a few seconds. While it might seem extraneous, alt text and similarly hard-to-reach metadata are essential for web users who are visually impaired. Screen readers, which parse HTML data for text and then convert it into audio (or Braille), allow those with poor or no eyesight navigate the web.
On social media, alt text basically does not exist. Blogging platforms and content-management systems might have fields in which users can insert alt text, but social platforms — even popular ones like Facebook — generally do not. This is a product of both user and developer laziness. Social-media users are often not aware of the purpose that alt text serves, and, even if they were, adding it complicates the publishing process. Users may be inclined to skip it (which is not great, but fine; individual users generally shouldn’t be held to the same accessibility standards as, say, a major news site would be). Developers, seeking to make publishing as easy as possible in order to encourage users to continue posting, often don’t even provide the option for alt text.
This is what makes Twitter’s announcement today all the more exciting — they’re introducing accessibility options in a simple manner. “The next time you add an image to a Tweet,” they write, “each thumbnail in the composer will have an ‘add description’ button. Tap it to add a description to the image. People who are visually impaired will have access to the description via their assistive technology.” Descriptions can be up to 420 characters (nice). The functionality is also available via Twitter’s API, meaning third-party apps can bake it into their apps as well.
Here it is in action on a photo of a dog that I tweeted.
It doesn’t look like much, but it could make a world of difference for the visually impaired. Now, it’s up to Twitter’s users to actually take advantage of it.
Beyoncé is just like you. When she’s in town on business and all the hotels are booked, she uses Airbnb. The difference is that when Beyoncé uses Airbnb, she rents a $10,000-a-night mansion that sits on 12 acres, and comes with an infinity pool and live chickens. And that her business is turning the Super Bowl halftime show into an artistic and political triumph. But otherwise, basically the same.
TMZ reports Beyoncé made her foray into the sharing economy up in Los Altos Hills, just a 30-minute drive from Levi’s Stadium. The mansion she stayed in — presumably with Jay Z, Blue Ivy, and an entourage — has five bedrooms and eight bathrooms. According to the listing on Airbnb, it can accommodate up to ten guests.
Other nice-to-haves: a game room, a fitness center, a rooftop vegetable garden, an orchard, five ovens, three dishwashers, and “tremendous walls of glass, some that entirely disappear.”
Also essential for a celebrity of Bey’s stature: a gate and a surveillance system. Neighbors told TMZ they knew she was staying there because police SUVs with blacked-out windows were patrolling nearby.
And how was Beyoncé’s weekend at the Bay Area mansion? Same as her halftime performance: super.
Look, writing a romantic note to your significant other is hard. Nobody wants to go overboard and sound creepy or voyeuristic. That’s why, rather than take a chance on writing his own material, Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson did what many others do: He turned to Google.
A quick search of the above text, describing Wilson’s girlfriend, Ciara, will lead you to descriptivewriting.wordpress.com, which contains many tips and pointers on how to describe a beautiful woman.
Wilson likely searched for “how to describe a beautiful woman” and just went with the first result. As Deadspin points out, he’s used this same tactic on at least one other occasion. A word to the wise: If you can find it on Google, so can everybody else.
Perfect. Just perfect. AMAZON WILL NEVER BE DONE.
Rob Dubbin, a writer for The Colbert Report and now director of digital for The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, knows Twitter bots. He’s been making them for years, and wrote a very good New Yorker piece in 2013 about the rise of bots as art and entertainment. His latest project, a collaboration with Clickhole writer and very good botmaker Jamie Brew, is Bezos Prime, an automated parody of Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos.
Bezos Prime apparently draws on years’ worth of Bezos’s shareholder letters to generate new, lifelike sentences, and it is funny as hell. The results always manage to spoof Bezos’s personality — not entirely un-robotic — or the rise of Amazon as a city-eating, bookstore-destroying monolith that we all use anyway because it’s just so damn convenient. The name, of course, spoofs Amazon Prime.
is it easy to use technology? we can do that — Jeffrey (@BezosPrime) January 31, 2016
It even does tiny little two- and three-part tweetstorms.
The Ecuadorian Transit Commission found an adorable, frightened sloth hugging a signpost on the side of a highway in Quevedo, and the little dude has become an instant internet sensation. The sloth is going to be fine, and everyone loves a cute animal-rescue story. But everyone also loves this very relatable photo that speaks to our secret desire for solitude.
Self-identifying as an introvert has surged in popularity as a result of many, many BuzzFeed quizzes, and when introverts see this darling sloth clinging to his pole like, “Leave me alone,” they can totally relate. The sloth? It’s them. See?
The sloth has been to the vet and will be released back into his natural habitat, where he can slowly live out the rest of his life as an internet meme.
As ever, one of Tumblr’s favorite sayings holds true: Your faves are problematic. Oscar Isaac has thus far declined to address the nontroversy, but were he asked about it, one imagines he would shrug.
Between his charming interviews, heavy brow, and X-Wing flight suit, Star Wars: The Force Awakens star Oscar Isaac has swept the Tumblr corner of the internet off of its feet. Can anything stop the Isaac-crush juggernaut? Yes: The possibility that he might enjoy the work of right-wing novelist Ayn Rand. Drama!
Here it is: an old photo of Isaac wearing an Atlas Shrugged t-shirt, the kind of betrayal not seen since Party Down’s Casey Klein expressed affection for Rand in the classic episode “Steve Guttenberg’s Birthday.” Let’s not pause to consider that Isaac could have been wearing the shirt ironically, might not really be familiar with Rand, or might have changed his mind about her in the intervening half-decade — because his outraged ex-fans certainly didn’t. Instead, maybe we can try to understand why the shirt hit such a raw nerve. To do that, we have to understand how the internet chooses its consensus man-crush.
Fortunately, Sulana Misra went deep on the topic for the Cut just a day ago, in honor of the internet and Oscar Isaac formally going steady.
The boyfriend selection process, Misra writes, is a “joke — but not really — about how men in politics and popular culture often fall short of our expectations. Instead of noting how someone has failed to respect us or listen to us, shaking our heads, and tagging the incident #banmen, we’re holding up our internet boyfriends as a better way to be.”
It takes place largely within “the safe spaces of Tumblr and BuzzFeed,” communities where it’s likely to be taken seriously and not condescendingly dismissed.
It shouldn’t be surprising that their vision of ideal man, the one who listens and respects, genuinely seems to care about others, and tends to play roles other than the totally normative romantic lead, doesn’t exactly comport with Rand’s. John Galt, the speechifying individualist who mansplains Rand’s philosophy for 90 uninterrupted pages of Atlas, is not exactly the internet’s “type.”
Hence the disappointment with Oscar Isaac, which was quite emphatic.
Users were also asked to interpret the emoji semantically — as in, “what does this emoji mean?” — and once again demonstrated that there are no universal definitions. The “smirking face” emoji had one of the highest misconstrual scores scores for every platform in the survey, except for Google — which makes sense if you think about it, because who the hell knows what a smirk actually means in any given situation.
The widest semantic interpretation between different platforms applied to the “person raising both hands in celebration” (🙌) emoji. Inversely, everyone pretty much agreed on what the “smiling face with heart-shaped eyes” (😍) meant.
Still no word on whether these hands 🙏 are praying or high-fiving. (For the record: praying.)
Overall, the researchers concluded that between platforms, and within them, there is a clear chance for people to misinterpret emoji on what they mean sentimentally and literally. So if you believed that emoji would somehow magically fix communication, think again. They might just be mucking things up more.
It’s tempting to hold up emoji as a kind of digital universal translator — so simple to use and understand, they can break down language barriers. Tempting, but wrong (or, in emoji, 👎).
As everyone who’s spent time arguing about 🙏 (high-five, or praying hands?) knows, emoji aren’t always clear — and the situation is worse when you’re dealing with different illustrations from Google, Apple, Facebook, and other tech companies. A new study from researchers at the University of Minnesota’s GroupLens laboratory shows that even when two people are looking at the same exact icon, they often have widely varying interpretations of its sentimental and semantic meanings. These disagreements are exacerbated when moving between platforms, as different tech companies have different art styles: “Grinning face with smiling eyes” looks very different on iPhones and Apple computers than it does on Android phones and in Google Hangouts. (The names and concepts behind emoji are officially approved by the unaffiliated Unicode Consortium, but it’s up to platform holders to illustrate their specific appearances.)
For one part of the study, survey participants were asked to evaluate the affects of various emoji on a ten-point scale, from –5, or negative, to 5, or positive. Even when participants were looking at the same icon, they had different ideas about its meaning. Take, for example, the aforementioned “Grinning face with smiling eyes”:
This seems like a fair response: the Apple “grin” is exactly the same as its “grimace,” and the “smiling eyes” are only visible at a large size. It’d be easy for an Android user to send Google’s “grinning face with smiling eyes” and for an iPhone-using recipient to interpret it very differently. More than a third of all emoji have this wide range of interpretation across platforms.
The study measured both between-platform and within-platform analysis, measuring not just the gap between interpretations of Android and Apple emoji, but the gap between an emoji’s intended meaning and its interpretation by a given platform. Take “loudly crying face,” which expresses a negative sentiment but which Apple users assign a positive sentiment — probably because it’s often used to indicate “crying laughter.” Also a problem for Apple users is our old friend “Grinning face with smiling eyes”:
Obviously, emoji are fluid: “eggplant” can mean, uh, a few different things. But if Apple users all believe “crying face” is positive, and Google users don’t, you could end up with some awkward conversations.
Hoverboards are finally good for something other than avoidable bloopers and unnecessary hospital bills. Specifically, dressing up like Dragon Ball Z’s Goku and cruising through Taipei on your flying battle cloud like it’s just a regular day. This video drew a huge crowd of kids in a park, and an even huger crowd of viewers on YouTube.
Judging from the behind-the-scenes video, the cloud is built around a crazy-cheap hoverboard — or “hands-free Segway thing,” if you prefer — like the one recently plugged by popular YouTuber Casey Neistat. Cover it with cloud-foam at your own risk, I guess.
Goku leading an army of screaming children is the only good hoverboard video concept I’ve seen so far that doesn’t involve someone accidentally falling off of one, and brings us one terrifying step closer to a world where anime is real.
But as is always the case, people have taken the #Upgrade format and run with it. Now instead of a humblebrag, it’s turned into a combo of some of the viral web’s favorite tropes: “X looks like Y,” Celebrity Pokémon Evolutions, and Expectations vs. Reality.
The results are very good.
This week, a new meme has emerged on Twitter that threatens to swallow all other memes whole. It is called #UpgradeChallenge. Here is how it works:
Picture No. 1: a picture of something Picture No. 2: a certain stock photo of a keyboard button that reads “UPGRADE” Picture No. 3: the “upgraded” version of whatever was in picture No. 1
It’s got all of the standard narrative. A beginning, middle, and end. Rising action, falling action. Emotion, drama, triumph.
#Upgrade is a super-meme. Initially, it started as a sort of conflation of Throwback Thursday and the #humblebrag. Users post embarrassing pictures of themselves when they were younger, and then pics of them looking mature and attractive.
So here’s a good, dumb idea: There should be a “public option” social network. The open web exists as a public and largely protected space, but it lacks the convenience or centralization of Twitter or other social networks. Let’s build one! A public, open, convenient, centralized social network, dedicated to freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment. The Postal Service — one of the great achievements in networking in U.S. history, lately underfunded, overlooked, and abused — can run it. Yes, it will be bad and slow and janky and bureaucratic; and yes, it will end up being about as much a true public square (and about as loud and exasperating) as Times Square. But at least we’ll be saved the embarrassment of reconciling freedom of expression and verification status in a mall. Because right now, the way we’ve allowed the internet to develop over the last decade-plus, the mall is still the best place to have conversations.
On Friday, Milo Yiannopoulos, Breitbart News’s chief video-game and gender-issues columnist, lost his “verified badge” — the blue check mark Twitter provides to prominent Twitter users like celebrities, journalists, and venture capitalists to confirm that their bad tweets are actually coming from their terrible fingers and not those of parodists or imitators. “I’ve been sat on the naughty table!” he tweeted Friday afternoon, attaching a screenshot of the email from Twitter, which declined to explain why his account would no longer sport the flair that graces leading accounts like Spencer Pratt’s and Charmin’s.
The disappeared verification has turned into an ongoing controversy. Yiannopoulos’s eager and devoted fans have refashioned their accounts in imitation of his, an attempt to illustrate how easy it would be to impersonate him if he no longer had the blue check mark. #JeSuisMilo was trending over the weekend. Prominent venture capitalists like Jason Calacanis and Marc Andreessen tweeted in support of Yiannopoulos. At some point, a petition was formed at WhiteHouse.gov: “We petition the Obama administration to issue a statement demanding the restoration of Milo Yiannopoulos’s Twitter verification badge.” The incident was covered by the tech press: “Twitter Unverifies Writer Amid Speech Wars,” wrote BuzzFeed. “Twitter crackdown on hate speech backfires,” the CNN headline read.
What a silly and impoverished conversation! To the extent that “speech” is really in play at all, Twitter’s decision to de-verify Yiannopoulos isn’t at all about suppressing it. It’s about whether it wants to be seen as supporting or associating itself with a kind that has earned an enormous amount of criticism from an influential audience. Yiannopoulos, best known for his disquisitions in support of Gamergate, positions himself when convenient as a cheeky provocateur, and is quick to hide behind claims of satire and humor when confronted about his racist or sexist jokes. His fanbase is nasty and obsessive and prone to endlessly (and threateningly) harassing anyone Yiannopoulos turns on in his columns or tweets, as Holly Wood/@girlziplocked wrote on Medium last week. It goes without saying that Twitter wouldn’t want to attach any kind of official-looking seal to his account — especially when a huge number of people are constantly complaining about it.
But this is what happens when you say you stand “for freedom of expression” (as Twitter founder Jack Dorsey has) and also create an implicitly tiered system like “verification” that creates the appearance of approval.
By calling itself “the free-speech wing of the free-speech party,” Twitter has consistently positioned the company as a kind of digital town square, and driven every user policy decision into the realm of “speech wars.” And it’s unfortunately true that in many ways, Twitter fulfills the traditional function of being a gathering place for the free exchange of ideas. But when you subcontract the provision and maintenance of a town square to a corporation, it’s not going to be run like a town square (and all the good and bad that that entails). It’s going to be a run like a mall.
And make no mistake: Twitter is a mall. Its function is to entice people to spend time in it so that they can be sold something. I don’t mean this pejoratively, necessarily. I love Spencer’s Gifts and Auntie Anne’s! And, in many cases, malls can be good places to hold quiet conversations about politics between friends. But if you make people uncomfortable — if you yell or harass or loudly and consistently express political opinions far outside the tolerance of the mall’s customer base — eventually, mall cops on Segways will show up to demand your ID and hustle you out, maybe permanently.
The underlying problem is not just that Twitter is a single for-profit service with a specific culture and community, but that it’s been allowed outsize importance in (a portion of) the public conversation. At the Awl, John Herrman writes that Twitter has become, for journalists, “a major part of their jobs” and “a context,” which helps get at how key the service has become for many professional writers and reporters. I’d go further and suggest that Twitter has done what Facebook has always threatened to do and “become the internet” — the central and fundamental point of contact with everything online — for many different loud, influential, and volatile segments of the population, including journalists, activists, venture capitalists, tech workers, and otaku extremists.
In which case: No wonder we talk about the removal of flair as a speech issue! What started as a casual messaging service and a media-tech playground has now become, for a large and powerful segment of the population, the essential space online for public discourse. Somehow we’ve decided that the best place to talk about gender representation in video games is the mall! And now we are discussing whether or not the mall has an adequate commitment to free speech, or whether it’s a given woman’s own fault that she’s being followed around the mall by groups of jeering teenagers. This is self-evidently horrible.
A survey of more than 5,000 Match.com users confirms what you’ve long suspected — heavy emoji users are just hornier than the rest of us. The horny news was reported by Maxim.com, the website of one of America’s horniest periodicals.
People who frequently have sex (and have already signed up for Match.com, which is a telling signpost of horniness in and of itself) are much more likely to use emoji, the study found. In fact, it seems like the more you use emoji, the more likely you are to get laid at least once a month. Only 13 percent of women and 26 percent of men who claim they never use emoji also claimed to be banging on the regular. But among those who said they used “more than one in every text,” 46 percent of the women and 64 percent of the men were getting laid monthly. Eggplant emoji. Splashing-sweat-symbol emoji.
Emoji users also think about sex more often. Those who use more than one per text were also the most likely to say they think about sex several times a day, with those who never use them again proving the least horny.
Is this just a generational gap? It stands to reason that young people are more virile, randy, and DTF, and also more conversant in the sensual language of little fruit and vegetable icons and winky faces. A correlation seems likely, but the published data doesn’t cross-reference age with emoji use and relative arousal, so it’s difficult to confirm.
But that isn’t the only survey of emoji and sex. A separate study by DrEd looked at 9 million tweets and determined that their usage is heavily gendered: In the U.S., women were far more likely to use any emoji containing lips or a heart, while dudes preferred the ubiquitous phallic eggplant. Not entirely surprising. It is interesting to note, however, that when it came to representing the male member in emoji form, men preferred the thick, deep-purple eggplant, while women tended to employ the more modest banana.
Interestingly, the eggplant = penis equation hasn’t caught on at all in Europe. Horny, emoji-using Twitter men of America, perhaps you’re feeling yourself just a little too much? Food for thought.
Chris Poole, the creator of anarchic meme foundry 4chan, now works for one of the world’s largest tech companies. In a short blog post, Poole (a.k.a. Moot) announced that he is headed to Google.
Poole’s post specifically cited his time “building online communities,” mainly 4chan, which had Everest-like highs and Mariana Trench–like lows.
Poole will work on the long-struggling Google Plus, the company’s social network. Bradley Horowitz, the vice-president of Streams, Photos and Sharing, confirmed the announcement by welcoming Poole.
Moot sold 4chan last September. Even prior to that, he had been focused on other web projects, including the failed website Canvas, later renamed DrawQuest.
If you only know Moot through the website he founded, then this news might surprise. 4chan is, well, not for everyone. But this does make a lot of sense once you realize that Moot didn’t really participate in trolling so much as he became a mascot for it (4chan users manipulated a Time magazine poll one year to name him most influential). If you take a zoomed-out view of 4chan, it’s the product of someone who has thought long and hard about how to build a community, determining what its guiding principles and boundaries should be. Google’s idea of a community is probably more SFW, but the mandate seems largely the same.
The “Vlogvember” series is pretty hard to watch. Bliss stumbles through his monologues like a champion mumblecore actor. The awareness that it’s satire sometimes falls away and it just becomes another piece of terrible content on your screen. The project’s strength, however, is treading that line with a completely straight face. Its relative roughness is part of the package. “I filmed, edited, and uploaded each video on the same day and came up with the ideas the night before,” Bliss says. “It was like taking part in one of those 24-hour film-making competitions every day.”
The exhaustion is tangible. By the end of the month, Bliss hints at the emptiness of star social-media presences, with his fake YouTuber girlfriend requesting retweets and trumped-up meetings with Google executives wanting to monetize him. That sadness is part of the project, too. Bliss is sensitive to the YouTuber’s plight, or the quandary of anyone who thinks they can find an authentic connection broadcasting their lives online. “There is a grain of sincerity in there,” he says. “Quite a few of my friends are YouTubers so I am constantly exposed to this weird world.” Maybe it’s not quite all it looks in the videos.
The British director, photographer, and social-media presence Adrian Bliss wants you to know that he started a vlog. It’s part of something called “Vlogvember,” which sees YouTubers post a video a day for an entire month, perhaps riffing off the annual writing-based National Novel Writing Month, also in November. Bliss’s exercise in daily self-documentation is completely excruciating, but that’s because it’s supposed to be.
Bliss’s “Vlogvember” is a parody of YouTuber culture that works only because it’s a send-up. It’s dangerously close to the actual reality of people shooting mundane slices of their lives and then putting them online for the public to see, but watching the series, it’s gradually clear that the long pauses are intentional — as is the halting speech, the superficial question prompts aimed at viewer #engagement, and the terrible video-editing effects. In many episodes, Bliss says that he has a big announcement coming soon. There is never any announcement.
“I started it as a bit of an experiment, and because I wanted to make fun of this unusual world I’m a part of. I always found the whole vlogging thing pretty weird,” Bliss says. In fact, the rest of the channel is filled with slightly less incisive, but no less funny, videos like Vlog From the Future and pieces he produced for other famous YouTubers, like the South African teenager Caspar. But Vlogvember was a way to inject a little bit of criticism. Bliss wasn’t sure how it would be received. “I expected lots of people to not get it, but the comments of the videos were often funnier than the actual video, with people playing along with the joke.”
Bliss aims his smartphone at himself strolling around parks, laying on the couch, going to lunch, never doing much of anything — boring even for a YouTube channel. But he also slyly satirizes community memes like YouTubers going vegan, having fake social media relationships — see “Meet My Girlfriend” — and launching merchandise (a plain teapot and footstool emblazoned with his signature slogan, “have fun during the day”).
The latter was even turned into a twee ballad of a theme song by fellow YouTuber Tom Rosenthal. It’s enough to charm even Essena O’Neill, the Australian Instagram star who abruptly quit and took to Vimeo to decry how fake all social media is.
For some online, sympathy turned to anger, and other Harmons began receiving threats and insults on social media. This afternoon, Brock Harmon tried to mitigate the situation by posting his own photo with papaw.
Most important, though dinner might have been a bummer, papaw is reportedly doing well. “Yes, he’s fine!” Kelsey said. “He is happy and he knows we love him.”
This morning, like every morning, thousands of people got extremely mad online because of a tweet. But this wasn’t just any tweet — this was an extremely sad tweet, about a man whose grandchildren didn’t show up for the hamburger dinner he’d cooked them. We spoke to the lone good grandchild to see how sad we, too, should be. First, some context, not that it will even, really, help: Thursday night, Kelsey Harmon posted this devastating tweet about her dinner with papaw.
That’s a bit depressing! Also, apparently, meme-worthy: As of this evening nearly 80,000 people, fueled by either righteous indignation or Schadenfreude, have retweeted the post. Which, sure! Why not?! Sad burger grandfather can be a meme! It’s the 21st century!
Twitter, desperately trying to figure out what to do with the often inexplicably viral content that seizes its service like a panic attack, turned it into a “Twitter Moment,” embedded below.
Poor Harmon, meanwhile, was forced to field the tide of anger:
We managed to get in touch with her to hear more. Over Facebook, Harmon provided some context for the photo. It’s rare for all six grandkids — some in high school, some in college — to be in town at once, so papaw wanted to get everyone together. But things did not go as planned.
Here is Washington Nationals player Bryce Harper attempting to pronounce the word meme, and inadvertently launching a meme himself:
What is a meme? Meme is a word coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins to describe an idea that passes in a culture the way genes pass in reproduction. Memes are the building blocks of a shared culture; on the internet, they consist of ancient and often inscrutable jokes that can be reconstituted and combined in nearly unlimited ways.
How do you pronounce meme? Not like Bryce Harper.
Episode 0106: “The Appfather”Summary: Garfplr launches and immediately rises to the top of the App Store, thanks to it being featured on Apple’s first television series.
Episode 0107: “The Day the App Stood Still”Summary: Craig and Erika get worried when Facebook copies all of Garfplr’s functionality, but in a not-as-good implementation.
Episode 0108: “Gone With the Apps”Summary: Daily Active User statistics drop precipitously as Garfplr’s harassment problem grows. Craig and Erika raise a third round of venture-capital funding.
Episode 0109: “Appageddon”Summary: Apple Computer releases its own first-party version of Garfplr, cannibalizing Craig and Erika’s app and pushing them out of the market.
Episode 0110: “Appenstein”Summary: Garfplr is acquired by Google.
News broke Thursday that Apple, long rumored to be considering creating its own original content à la Amazon or Netflix, is working on its first television show. According to the New York Times, the show is a “nonscripted” series — which means it’s a documentary, reality TV, or somewhere in between — and it’s about … apps.
Here’s what’s known: World-famous hologram will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas and TV executives Ben Silverman and Howard T. Owens are involved.
Here’s what’s not known, according to the Times: “financing, title, timeline, storylines, episode length or how people will watch the show.” So, everything. Luckily, a very real source who definitely works at Apple sent me a rundown of the show’s first ten episodes. To reiterate, these are completely real.
Episode 0101: “App’s Well That Ends Well”Summary: Craig and Erika set out to create an app that will change the world. But their brainstorm runs into trouble when their Seamless delivery is late.
Episode 0102: “Planet of the Apps”Summary: Craig and Erika decide on a name for their company and begin querying Stack Exchange with questions like “where to get xcode” and “xcode keeps crashing.” They eventually realize that the iOS SDK is only available on Mac.
Episode 0103: “Apps Apps Baby”Summary: While Erika continues to prototype their new app, Craig starts building buzz on social media. Their Facebook page gets 14 “likes” in the first week, while Erika retweets the app’s first tweet from her personal account.
Episode 0104: “App to the Future”Summary: The pair finally decides on a name for their company, Garfplr. They also lock down what their app does: “Change how we experience the world.”
Episode 0105: “The Wizard of Apps”Summary: Garfplr pivots. The app is now “Tinder for groceries and other household items.”
There’s Matt, a hot Harvard guy I met when I was a barista. It took me giving him about 15 free shots of espresso until he finally asked me out. We went on some fun dates, but he ended things pretty unexpectedly. “i don’t want to be disingenuous with you,” he wrote me. “a thing with this person that was off kind of became on again. which changes my situation a bit.” Does this change your situation, Matt?
Matt never replied, which means he’ll be receiving these texts monthly until he responds or one of us dies.
After a brief L.A. fling with an older guy, I found Ian back in New York. We matched on Tinder about a year ago and never ended up meeting, but I ran into him at a friend’s party and we hooked up a week later. We’d texted back-and-forth a bit, but I think we both felt largely indifferent about continuing things, so we never met up again.
“What the what” is not the response of a man who wants to get dicked down in 2016. He goes on the naughty list.
Sam slid into my DMs to ask me out for drinks shortly after Ian. I would’ve liked to go out again, but I got the sense this would be a one-off thing, partly because he was so good at parrying my “want to hang out” texts. I was ultimately okay with all that.
Lackluster and uninterested. Coal for Sam this year.
Which leaves us with Tom. Tom and I went on a series of nice dates, and then some less nice ones. I was feeling weird about our last date, so I sent him a text message effectively breaking things off. He asked that we talk about it in person; I sent him my DICKCEMBER text.
“What’s good?” my text to Tom began. We’d only been on five dates, and it didn’t seem like the relationship was going in the right direction. We planned to meet up and discuss whether we’d continue, but I was pretty sure we were done. I wanted to send him a text before we saw each other. It continued:
Before I sent the DICKCEMBER texts, I wasn’t particularly looking forward to meeting up with Tom. But walking to the bar, I felt oddly giddy and carefree. My past romantic rejections, my occasional regrettable casual sex, the stressful game that is dating: None of it felt serious anymore. It was Dickcember, and I was celebrating.
Matt’s thing with that person that was off kind of becoming on again? No biggie. I’ll keep popping that peppermint pussy. Joe lives in L.A. so things didn’t work out, but so what? I can still get rawed under the mistletoe. Sam was only into me for the night, but who cares? I can find someone else’s candy-cane cum to guzzle.
I found Tom sitting in a booth at the back. We talked about our weird dates, we talked about Dickcember, and we made out a little bit. Did I want to spend my Dickcember with Tom? I did. Was I an UGLY GRINCH? No. I knew I was getting dicked down in 2016, and for that I could thank the anonymous author of the best dirty chain text I’d ever received and passed on.
I can’t claim to have come up with something so poignant and poetic on my own. I’d copy-and-pasted a chain text my friend William sends me monthly. Last month’s:
These dirty chain text messages have been around for a while. If you’re friends with a particular type of smartphone-owning person, you might have received one of these messages already. (On Mic.com, Jack Smith IV likens the messages to “the kind [of chain mail] you’d get from superstitious aunts telling you to immediately forward it along to 10 other people or suffer bad luck or a broken back.”) Many of them coincide with a holiday, or the beginning of the month — when they act as a sort of sexier “rabbit rabbit rabbit” — but others deal with the transition from childhood into adolescence, hotboxing at church, and most unfortunately, “daddies who give you cummies.”
The form is simple: excessive, inventive use of emojis, hilariously explicit sexual content, and a threat of a terrible curse if you don’t pass along the message. They’re all written with tongue planted firmly in cheek (or elsewhere), as you’ll see when browsing the excellent Tumblr that collects them.
I was pleased to receive my early-December text because romantically speaking, 2015 has been less than great for me. For the first half of the year, I became unfortunately entangled in an affair with a man 20 years my senior. Once out of that, I casually dated, but everything fizzled out or ended poorly. In 2015, I was sad and anxious about every romantic tryst I had; nothing was particularly fun. And I was tired of not having fun. The last thing I wanted was a 2016 without getting dicked down. So, following instructions, I sent the Dickcember message to every guy I went out with since September.
This response to men being scummy on the internet is entirely warranted, but does it work?
Sears thinks so. Since she started calling out guys in a personal way, “the number [of dick pics] has been significantly lower. I think my followers are slowly getting the message,” she said.
Really sad that it’s come to this, but at least the victims of online harassment have created a hilarious (and apparently effective) way to regain some agency.
Unsolicited dick pics are a disgusting fact of life for women on the internet, and the problem is many times worse if you’re a model with a popular Instagram account. Emily Sears, an Australian model who lives in L.A. and has 2.3 million Instagram followers, told BuzzFeed that she’s fed up with receiving unwanted photos of penises on a daily basis. So she’s started fighting back by screencapping the messages and sending them to the lecherous men’s wives and girlfriends.
Sometimes she’ll just Google a photo of the offending dude with his girlfriend and send it back to him. That usually gets a quick — if insincere — apology, and, best case, deters the dude from doing it again.
“We send the photos as a reminder for them to have respect for women,” Sears told BuzzFeed. “I think it provides an accountability that people seem to lose online, being behind a screen gives people a false sense of anonymity.”
Sears’s friend Laura Lux, a DJ with 670,000 followers on Instagram, has been shutting down dick-piccing dudes in the same manner. She told BuzzFeed the idea came to her two years ago, when she went to block a guy and saw photos of his girlfriend on his profile. And the girlfriend had commented on the photos, calling him the “best boyfriend ever.”
Lux decided the woman should know what the “best boyfriend ever” was doing in his spare time.
“I sent her a message with a screenshot of our conversation telling her that I was really sorry, but I thought she deserved to know how her boyfriend was behaving towards other women,” she told BuzzFeed.

When The Force Awakens hits theaters on Friday, it’ll kick off a whole new generation of Star Wars films. There’s already a prequel in the works about a young Han Solo, helmed by Chris Miller and Phil Lord of The Lego Movie. Looks like everything really is awesome! (The song!) The only question is: Who should play young Han Solo? Over 2,000 actors are reportedly in the running to take on an iconic role defined by one of the planet’s biggest movie stars. But who could possibly pull it off? For that matter, as other prequels gear up, who can play young versions of all the original gang? Miller, Lord, Abrams, and Disney are turning toward Hollywood. But we have another suggestion: Why not Vine? What better way to pack the seats at a screening than by casting a handful of corn-fed teenagers whose six-second videos of pranks have earned them legions of adolescent fans?

The Snape I saw onscreen was sort of — maybe too — … cool, I thought as an 11-year-old.
But it wasn’t that he was cool — the word my child’s brain was searching for was complicated. We now know what Rowling was gearing up for, the complicated character she was intending to create from the start. It’s not a very original series of tropes — tortured by his lost love, Snape overcomes his sourness to Do the Right Thing — but it’s certainly more interesting than a 30-year-old man who loves to insult children.
It’s a kind of magic, acting, and Rickman was particularly skilled at taking bit parts and finding an emotional core that made these characters seem full of hidden depths, real and difficult memories, a gravity that might have been otherwise lacking. When Alan Rickman started playing Snape, we had all just finished reading The Goblet of Fire and the fandom was just starting to understand that these books were not just a fun romp about wizard children. Rickman, even in those abominable first two movies, found that future darkness, that future complication, before any of the rest of us.
That performance, which anticipated better than any other the darkening universe we were watching Rowling create in the books, ceased arguments about Rickman. He was beloved by nearly the entire fandom, and his fans were particularly devoted and passionate. The only complaint you can have about Rickman was that he might be too charming as Snape, as evidenced by the group of women who claimed to be married to him on an astral plane. Rickman was deeply charismatic. But I think it was the way his intelligent and nuanced performance acknowledged the quality of the source material that placed him so near the heart of a much-maligned fandom.
Snape isn’t even my favorite Rickman role. I tend to prefer my Rickman either sillier (Alexander Dane in Galaxy Quest) or darker (Antoine Richis in Perfume: Story of a Murderer). But there’s something incredible about Rickman’s Snape that I keep coming back to, something made even better thanks to my intimate and consuming fandom of the books. So many of my favorite parts of the books were cut from the movies, many of them dealing with Snape’s backstory. But as a fan, I never felt as if those parts were missing when I saw Rickman onscreen.
I always wondered what other people thought, people who didn’t read the books, when they watched these movies. But when Rickman as Snape screamed at Harry for trespassing into his worst memory, the exact moment when he would lose Lily Evans forever, I knew they saw what I saw. There are many wonderful British actors in the Harry Potter movies, but Rickman was always the core of that cast, grounding those sometimes-shaky adaptations for a wider audience. In many ways, without Rickman, these movies would have been worthless.
There was no other actor who could have made me like Snape. Try as she might, J.K. Rowling alone didn’t truly convince me that he was anything more than a mean, bitter old man. Even when, in the books, Snape was nothing more than cruel, Rickman found his sensitivity.
Last year I deleted all my old LiveJournals. I don’t need a community of screaming fans to tell me how to like things anymore, to help me find what is interesting about characters like Snape. Rickman showed me that I could do it myself — with the help of a talented artist. His immense talent, his subtlety, and his charm revealed more to me than any LJ post could have. When I reread the books, it’s Rickman’s voice I hear in my head. Yes, after all this time. Always.
Alan Rickman did something J.K. Rowling could never do: He got me to like Severus Snape. In the fandom, this was always controversial.
I spent a lot of time in the Harry Potter fandom LiveJournal community as a lonely middle-schooler, and at the time I loved nothing more than to spend my days doing amateur literary analysis on a book series about wizards. That first rush of initial castings was yet another chance for us to stretch our fledgling analytical muscles, and to write essay-length posts on What This Might Mean for the Movies.
In the fandom, every single casting announcement was a signal flare for drama. Rickman was no exception. When he was announced as Severus Snape, Harry Potter’s Defense Against the Dark Arts professor and sometime nemesis, the general consensus was that Tim Roth — rumored to have been in consideration — was the better choice.
The Potters, after all, were supposed to have died ten years earlier in their early 30s, and Snape was supposed to have been their contemporary. Rickman was in his 50s when cast. On LiveJournal, people wondered if he’d be in heavy makeup to age him down, or what, because it seemed obvious to us that this was going to ruin the internal logic of the series.
I was 11. Harry Potter fandom was the single largest fandom on LiveJournal at the time. We had a somewhat-deserved reputation for being incredibly dramatic. Our Rickman-related speculation devolved into a series of sub arguments. Nerdy Anglophiles already found Rickman pretty sexy — was that going to be a problem for the new influx of movie-only fans, who might find him sympathetic instead of loathable? If the young Daniel Radcliffe wouldn’t wear green contacts, would the significance of Snape noting he has his mother’s eyes be lost on the audience?
Despite all of us liking Rickman on the whole, we all searched for ways to prove that somehow he was the wrong Snape. Snape, to those of us in the fandom, was the one great piece of proof that these books weren’t silly. Even if — in part because — the character was detestable, Snape was the sole bit of the books that best demonstrated J.K. Rowling’s literary skill. It was important to us that the movies got this right, and we were all so afraid they weren’t going to.
We were so wrong. Of course we were. Alan Rickman was a perfect Snape, mostly because he started to do what the books wouldn’t get to until much later.
The Snape I was reading in the books was little more than a sad, horrible little man who mourned his wasted life by bullying children. He was the man that went out of the way to punish Harry for simply existing, a man who took one look at a sobbing Hermione Granger, her two front teeth magically enlarged, and said, “I see no difference.”
A lot can be accomplished with complex motion-capture and CGI setups these days, but there’s still an intangible charm inherent to practical effects. Like when a small child climbs into a bear and does the Nae Nae. Great job, small child in this bear. Ted 3 looks amazing.
Yes, in 2014, someone at Facebook decided that the best way to jump into a chat room was to have people scan QR codes.
Riff, launched in April of this year, was inspired by memes like the Ice Bucket Challenge that had a universal structure that people, um, riffed on. It let users record videos and then send them to friends to expand up. At the time, Riff lead Josh Miller said, “We don’t know what a Riff is going to be good for.” It turns out the answer was “nothing.”
Other Creative Labs apps are still available. Moments, for sharing photo collections, is still up, as is the site’s app for Groups. Mentions, the app made so that celebrities could manage their fan pages, is also available. News-reading app Paper also had its underlying tech folded into the service’s new Instant Articles packaging.
Rest in peace, Creative Labs. Much like your apps, you were fine for a brief moment and then everyone realized they didn’t need to keep you around.
Two years ago, Facebook launched Creative Labs, a development studio within the larger organization meant to incubate ideas more suited to a bootstrapped garage start-up operation than a data-mining monolith. Now, that division is no more.
Creative Labs was responsible for apps you used for half a day and only kind of remember now. You know, classic apps like Slingshot, Rooms, and Riff. All three of those apps have been pulled from stores. Of nearly a dozen apps produced by the initiative, none of them were hits. Stand-alone apps for social networks are generally low-stakes pump-and-dumps; experimental stop-gaps to remind people that “Hey, we’re still maybe fun!” every few months.
Slingshot in June of last year was a supposed Snapchat killer with a gimmick that seemed neat(?) but was actually just really stupid. In order to open a photo from someone else you had to send one first. That’s a cool idea, except that it made it impossible to have an actual conversation, because you were responding to … a message you hadn’t read.
At launch, TechCrunch’s Josh Constine wrote:
Rooms was the company’s attempt at a new type of messaging app where users were not required to use their real name and anyone could join the conversation if they possessed the chat-room-specific QR code.
From the Verge:
Those watching were particularly shocked to see ID cards, including one apparently belonging to Farook’s mother, displayed for the MSNBC cameras with no information blurred out. Those calling out the network made sure to censor their screenshots:
CNN’s Victor Blackwell followed, and received the same shocked reaction from his audience:
Blackwell had initially tweeted photos from inside the suspects’ home, but later deleted them and reported that the door had been boarded back up — by private citizens, he made sure to note, not by the authorities.
Many on Twitter noted parallels between the cable channels and someone else who creepily invaded a home with a camera: Jake Gyllenhaal’s character in Nightcrawler. It didn’t take long for the comparison to become a meme:
On Friday morning, cable-news personnel descended en masse on the townhouse of deceased San Bernardino mass shooting suspects Tashfeen Malik and Syed Rizwan Farook, reporters eagerly waiting for the landlord to let them in so they could deliver an exclusive to the hungry public. But the public — at least the segment on Twitter — didn’t want it. In fact, the public was appalled.
Things got even worse when a reporter was seen coming out of the building with what appeared to be a Popsicle.
But the reporter, Toby Harnden of the Sunday Times of London, later clarified that he hadn’t stolen any frozen goodies from the scene. He was just handing an upside-down screwdriver to the landlord, who was trying to open the boarded-up door.
And speaking of that landlord: Along with the outrage and the memes came questions about how the cable-news outlets were allowed into the building in the first place.
CNN reported that the property owner, one Doyle Miller, had let reporters in by prying open the boarded-up door with a crowbar, and Anderson Cooper had an expert on to justify the invasion, speculating that “had this not been a released scene, there would have been a larger police presence.”
But that seemed strange to some, because there was a list of seized materials still sitting inside the apartment:
But did brave Twitter media critics turn off their TV sets in disgust? No. They live-tweeted every minute of the utter clusterfuck.
“I don’t know what’s going on,” Deputy Olivia Bozek, a spokesperson for the San Bernardino County sheriff’s department, told social-media news site Grasswire. “That is not a cleared crime scene. There’s still an active investigation going on.”
MSNBC, moving first, sent Kerry Sanders into the shooters’ closet — proudly trumpeting the move on Twitter, perhaps not aware of how people were going to react.
Viewers immediately wanted to know “WTF” he was doing in there, rummaging through what was presumably still the site of an active investigation:
The remarks made by Pope Francis were qualified slightly. He said that modern forms of communication were “a gift of God which involves a great responsibility.” That’s … so naïve. Nobody has had the heart to tell the most powerful religious leader in the world about all the terrible antics we get up to online. Please, nobody tell him. We must protect this pope at all costs.
Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church, is a fan of the internet and the way it allows human beings to connect. We know this because he said so himself. In a message regarding the church’s World Day of Communications, the pontiff said, “Emails, text messages, social networks and chats can also be fully human forms of communication.”
He added, “It is not technology which determines whether or not communication is authentic, but rather the human heart and our capacity to use wisely the means at our disposal.”
Extolling the virtues of digital communication makes it clear that Pope Francis — who once tweeted that “The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth” — has not spent a lot of time online. He has admitted as much.
Still, there is something very funny about the pope endorsing the web’s power to close expansive geographical and emotional gaps when tweets like these constantly appear in his mentions.
For further proof that the internet ruins the special moments in our lives, see this incident from Ohio. Photographer Delia D. Blackburn’s shots of Brittany Peck’s wedding went viral when she captured Peck’s father grabbing her stepdad to participate in the ceremony. The photos have been viewed 70 million times. Which should be great, right? A heartwarming gesture captured forever for the world to see? Wrong.
The photographer says that Brittany’s father, he of the beautiful gesture, is threatening to sue her for making money off the viral images, and she has received threatening messages online. “They’re trying to ruin me,” Blackburn said. The photographer had mentioned printing posters of the photo on Facebook, but still hasn’t delivered the shots to Peck herself. ”Hand us our pictures and we’ll go our separate ways,” the bride said.
Social media — it’s all one big Upworthy lovefest until someone tries to monetize on internet fame. Then it’s war.
All of which is just to say that this brilliant, perfect Vine mash-up now exists:
It works on so many levels.
Quick: Name two popular white women who have some trouble speaking off the cuff.
Here’s one: Former vice-presidential candidate and devoted reader of every newspaper Sarah Palin, who addressed a crowd in Ames, Iowa, on Tuesday, officially throwing her support behind autumn gourd Donald Trump for president. Discussing Trump’s appeal to her particular conservative demographic, she … well, she rapped. Really.
Here’s what Palin said, semi-rhythmically and semi-rhymingly:
“How ‘bout the rest of us? Right wingin’, bitter clingin’, proud clingers of our guns, our God, and our religions, and our Constitution. Tell us that we’re not red enough? Yeah, coming from the Establishment. Right.”
But the former governor of Alaska stumbled a little bit between “our God and our religions,” calling to mind a proud clinger of a different sort — another white female rapper whose popularity passed its peak years ago and whose delivery needed some serious work. Yes, Iggy Azalea, whose infamous stumbling freestyle was recently immortalized in Vine form:
Here’s a new web app so good and so useful that I can hardly believe it didn’t already exist: Frinkiac, a search engine for Simpsons quotes and their corresponding stills. Everyone knows the pain of wanting to drop the perfect Simpsons line, but coming up empty when trying to find the matching screenshot on Google Image Search. But, unlike Frinkiac’s three creators, not everyone would spend a month solving that problem.
Sean Schulte, Paul Kehrer, and Allie Young uploaded every episode from the 15 seasons of The Simpsons — the only seasons worth quoting anyway, if we’re honest — then wrote code to divide each one into 100 still images, and match those up with subtitle files. Then they made the whole thing searchable, so you can find every “d’oh!” “glaven,” and “Hi, I’m Troy McClure.”
It really helps to know the quotes by heart, though, because Frinkiac’s database doesn’t note who said each line. You can’t search by character. Kehrer told Wired that’s a side effect of how he and his co-creators (die-hard Simpsons fans, all) think about the show.
“We started from an almost encyclopedic memory of Simpsons quotes, which is kind of the basic unit of Thinking About The Simpsons for us. From seeing search queries, that’s not exactly common: many people seem to search for a description of the scene rather than just what is being said out loud,” he explained.
They hope to add more search functionality soon, and the ability to share screenshots more easily. Still, this is a huge breakthrough, and a long-awaited solution to one of life’s oldest problems. (The only previous solution was alcohol.)
It’s action-packed. Will people stride through the puddle or attempt to leap over it? Will someone drown in the puddle? Many commenters are now eagerly awaiting rush hour, when puddle traffic and puddle drama will likely peak. As I was writing this blog post, a man brought a floatie over to the puddle to chill in it.
We will continue to follow the Drummond Puddle and give you updates as needed.
On Periscope right now, a livestream of a puddle in Newcastle, England, has attracted a huge following, as tens of thousands of fans wait with bated breath to see how pedestrians attempt to navigate its treacherous depths (estimated by one commenter to be 5–6mm, or less than a quarter-inch).
That’s it. There’s not anything else going on. Just the puddle (apparently located at the Royal Grammar School in Newcastle), the pedestrians, and the viewers. It’s sort of like when the "Crazy Frog" song went to No. 1 on the charts in England ten years ago.
But, yes, fans are loving the puddle. They can’t get enough of #DrummondPuddleWatch. (Drummond is the company from whose offices the livestream is being broadcast.) The Drummond Puddle is the first big meme of 2016.
This person just walked through it like it was no big deal.
This guy showed up to demonstrate his great puddle-jumping technique.

You could make the case for the latter, but — much like the Smart Battery Case — it doesn’t quite feel right:
One of the most popular knocks on Apple’s iPhone 6 and 6S is that their battery life “sucks.” People demand speed and features, but they don’t want their devices to use too much power, and they don’t want a thicker phone. Apple, unfortunately, has to contend with physical reality when it designs its devices, so there’s nothing it can do about the constant complaints. Nothing except release a hideous new battery case for its flagship phone.
The new Smart Battery Case looks a lot like a regular iPhone sleeve, but the battery protrudes from the back, giving it what people have begun calling “a hump.” Early reviews of the case’s aesthetics are not especially positive:
Is the hump a perfect troll by Apple, showing the complaining masses that this is the devil’s bargain required for more battery life? Or is it a calculated, honest — albeit weird-looking — design decision that fits in with the existing philosophy of Apple’s chief design officer Jony Ive?
The most important component of any holiday or major cultural event is the dirty chain text, as we explained a couple of weeks ago. Today’s release of a new Star Wars film is one of the most important events of the year, and it wouldn’t be complete without a dirty chain text to go along with it.
Sadly, none of our regular sources of dirty chain texts had specifically Star Wars–themed missives, which is definitely just an oversight and not because there is no overlap between the categories “has knowledge of Star Wars” and “has knowledge of sex.”
So we consulted experts on both sides of the aisle and made our own.

Kanye West’s unexpected carpet-bombing of Wiz Khalifa on Twitter yesterday provided the world with more than just several hours’ worth of entertainment. It also provided us with an aspirational goal.
The truth is, while many may claim to be Kanye, in the end all of us are Wiz. But we can try to be Kanye; and to help us do so, we’ve created three motivational posters that you can print out and hang on the wall of your cubicle/bedroom/cell. Each one takes its inspirational and motivational message from Kanye’s tweets. Look to them when you are feeling unsure of yourself, or when someone distracts you from your creative process.
With extra motivational help from Seth Daggett and Jed Egan.
Popular vlogger Mathieu Richard was trending yesterday for all the wrong reasons. The French teen, whose hit channel Math Podcast (a play on his name, not an invigorating educational activity) has over 430,000 subscribers, began trending after some web sleuths and other YouTubers called him out on stealing their video scripts and remaking them.
This is not a Fine Bros. situation, in which Richard only aped another user’s format. He is accused of copying other videos in terms of both writing and visual technique.
A video uploaded yesterday lays it all out pretty well. Soon after, #MathPodcastPlagiat began trending on Twitter.
One of the plagiarized, Motoki Maxted, told BuzzFeed that he was aware of Richard’s behavior beforehand, and had even communicated with him about it. In Twitter DMs, he repeatedly asked Richard to simply add a link to his profile in the videos’ description.
Richard went on the radio to cop to translating and using American videos without credit. “I’ve loved making videos since I was young, but there is something I cannot do, which is write,” he said.
The weird thing about this situation is that this dustup seems entirely avoidable. Non-English speakers had no use for the original videos, and so Richard was filling a need. People repurpose content online all the time, so this issue isn’t particularly unique. The problem is more that Richard wasn’t crediting the original filmmakers. And in the case of at least one of them, Maxted, that’s all they wanted.
Last month, for the first time ever, one of Google’s self-driving cars — the ones it insists are safer than human-driven cars — crashed into another vehicle. According to a report filed with the California DMV, the Google car, briefly entering another lane to avoid sandbags in the road, struck a city bus. The test driver “saw the bus approaching in the left side mirror but believed the bus would stop or slow to allow the Google [autonomous vehicle] to continue,” according to the report, which was obtained by Re/code.
Google released part of its monthly self-driving car report early to Re/code, in which it both accepts blame and deflects it onto the bus driver — who is probably not a robot:
While it’s always heartening to see our future robot overlords screw up, it’s probably important to note that the Google self-driving cars have logged more than a million miles without any accidents that can be chalked up to the robot. Plus, the bus was going 15 miles per hour and the Google car was going two.
The BBC this week published a large, never-before-released collection of phone conversations between Bill Clinton and former U.K. prime minister Tony Blair. The chats between the world leaders took place at the tail end of the ’90s, and they run the gamut from the political to the personal. They’re occasionally revealing and occasionally funny — especially a weird in-joke about a banana. But they’re not as funny as the fake parody conversations that have been flying around Twitter.
These are all very, very good, and people on the internet are very credulous — which only makes them better.
Although the most popular spoofs are spreading without attribution on Twitter, and some people are treating them like they’re genuine transcripts from the Clinton Presidential Library, BuzzFeed reporter Jim Waterson sussed out their real author: London comedian Michael Spicer.
This is Spicer’s best joke, which — let’s be honest — is entirely believable given public perception of Bill Clinton:
It’s so real that even the former prime minister of Sweden apparently believed it and cited it as an example of the “special relationship” between the U.K. and the colonies.
And apparently some folks also believed Spicer’s other four spoofs, one of which features Clinton espousing the benefits of ham-punching — actually punching a ham with your fists until it falls apart — for stress relief.
In each joke, Spicer sets Clinton up as a friendly buffoon, with a quite proper Blair as his straight man. As you can see, it’s a winning formula:
There it is, some really solid reporting from me.
Twitter is unflinchingly public in a way that no other social network is. Facebook is a cacophony of granular privacy settings and its search function sucks, making it difficult to gauge the tone of conversation around the topic. Instagram and Tumblr, by focusing more heavily on multimedia, are cumbersome to sift through, unless you know what you’re looking for. Twitter, partly because of its reliance on text, is easy.
News organizations place a large emphasis on Twitter conversation because, despite its faults, it contains a myriad of opinions on any number of different topics. It might not be where most of the action is happening — Facebook and Instagram are both larger — but it is the most accessible from a technical standpoint. One can log on, query a couple of words, and receive dozens of opinions instantly. It’s all anecdotal evidence, but that’s generally what short, local news stories are — vertical slices, not longitudinal studies.
Social networks often market the perpetual conversation and idea exchange on their service as news value (on Tumblr, this is ironically referred to as the Discourse). Audiences might, as I once did, believe that reporters turn to Twitter because it contains the most substantive dialogue. This might be true, but it is not a foregone conclusion. Its brevity lends itself well to back-and-forth conversation, but I suspect that the unmentioned truth for many bloggers is that Twitter is generally referred to as a source of dialogue because it is the easiest to mine. On Twitter, it is very simple to find an expressed opinion, and then an independently expressed similar opinion confirming that Wow, more than one person thinks this thing. Hell, Twitter makes it easy to find 20 people with the same opinion. In the bygone days of news-gathering, finding 20 people who agreed on something was a lot of work. Now it just takes a few keystrokes.
No matter how terrible Twitter might get, it’s the baseline ease of use that ensures that it’s probably not going away for a while. That’s not meant in the sense of user-base growth but from a more meta perspective: People will continue to talk about what’s being talked about on Twitter.
Ten years ago today, Twitter came into existence. At first, the weird spinoff of a podcast directory called Odeo, Twitter is now the ur-social network, the service responsible for many social-media practices that we use today. Its users created the hashtag and the @-reply. It was the first major service to encourage third-party use of its API and data. And — as any remotely tech-savvy journalist will tell you — it became essential for news-gathering. (I’m not talking about breaking news situations either, though Twitter has proven to be a net positive in those situations as well.)
Still, Twitter’s staying power seems improbable. Almost since its founding, it’s had a reputation of being either inessential or impenetrable to the masses. Why, a prospective user might ask, would I want to sign up for a social network that gives me real-time updates on what my friends had for lunch? Why would I want to use a social network known for the vigor and vulgarity of its trolls? Why would I want to stare at this scrolling record of inanity and misogyny?
This seeming impenetrability has meant that even as Twitter has grown it’s also struggled with its identity, to the point that it’s even waffled on its defining 140-character limit in recent months. Compared to Facebook, which is also publicly traded, Twitter has been slow to acquire both new users and revenue. In addition to feeling simultaneously unusable and useless to the normal person, Twitter has continually struggled to combat harassment on the service. Suffice it to say: Twitter has many, many problems.
And yet: Media organizations are constantly talking about Twitter. An alien unfamiliar in the ways of Earth social media, given only blog posts and television news reports, would come to the conclusion that Twitter is by far the largest and most popular social network. The alien would be wrong — but how would it know?
The obvious reason for Twitter’s omnipresence — oft unspoken because it makes us look lazy — is that Twitter makes reporting easy. The closest old-media equivalent is the local-news, man-on-the-street interview, in which reporters literally just walk up to strangers and ask for a ten-second sound bite. Twitter is pretty much that, amplified by a magnitude of half a billion: an enormous database of average-Joe reactions that don’t even require the legwork of asking a question.
Here, I’ll demonstrate: Why do people love Twitter so much?
This bout to be an MP3 and my alarm RT @TylerIAm: Golden Girls Gospel Remix (Full Song) https://t.co/aBaKaRfxWa via @YouTube — Qwantin Tarentino (@YoungQwan) February 12, 2016
Thank you for being a friend, Aaron.
Back in November, a guy who goes by Finally Aaron “lost it a little bit” and sang his own gospel remix of the Golden Girls theme song, “Thank You for Being a Friend,” ad-libbing vocal flourishes and generally getting as excited as anyone has ever gotten over an ’80s TV theme tune. The 15-second snippet he put on Instagram burned with the heat of a thousand fire emoji, and the streets (of the internet) demanded more.
Months later, Finally Aaron has finally delivered his biggest gift: He did the whole song.
“I’ve warned many people that this would be UNDERWHELMING..buuut Its the full song..its finished,” he wrote on YouTube. “LIKE IT OR NOT ..im just glad I kept my word lol!”
I think Aaron may have underestimated how much people wanted him to do this. Do these folks seem underwhelmed to you? Nah.

Dunbar’s number, named for anthropologist Robin Dunbar, proposes that the number of meaningful relationships a human being can maintain is capped at around 150. During the early days of Facebook’s rise, commentators tried to apply Dunbar’s number to our ever-loosening online definition of “friend.” Now Dunbar himself has undertaken a study of Facebook and discovered the average person only has four “real” friends on Facebook, and around 14 people who give a crap at all. Depressing!
In an effort to determine whether social media can break past the apparent limit on our real-life friend networks, Dunbar surveyed more than 3,000 Facebook users, with an average “friend” count that shouldn’t be surprising: 150. But of those 150 friends, people said they could only count on 4.1 in an “emotional crisis,” and that only 13.6 were close friends who could be counted on for sympathy.
And the “support cliques” and “sympathy groups” didn’t seem to get larger as people acquired more Facebook friends, Dunbar found: “Respondents who had unusually large networks did not increase the numbers of close friendships they had, but rather added more loosely defined acquaintances into their friendship circle simply because most social media sites do not allow one to differentiate between these layers.”
The numbers Dunbar observed on Facebook fall right within the ranges he found in real-life friendships, leading him to conclude that software hasn’t yet increased the human brain’s capacity for maintaining social relationships. As he put it, “online social networks remain subject to the same cognitive demands of maintaining relationships that limit offline friendships.”
He also found that social media alone isn’t enough to maintain our close friendships. Talking online can slow down the decay of a relationship, but if we don’t see our best friends face-to-face, they’ll eventually fade from our group of four, to the group of about 14, to part of our 150, and eventually out into the ether of our 500 loose social contacts.
Technology can do a lot of things, but it still can’t give us more friends.
Chipotle stores were closed Monday so that staff could meet and discuss the health concerns surrounding the burrito chain. As a thank-you to customers who were missing out on their free-range burrito bowls, Chipotle offered a coupon for a free entrée to anyone who texted 888–222. What the company didn’t realize is that it was setting up … the heist of the century.
The setup: Find people who had tweeted their coupon and included the bar code required for redemption. The plan: Use that bar code to nab a free burrito. The mark: Enzo.
Above you see Eli, the master thief, bragging about his score. “I do not have any remorse for nabbing these burritos,” Eli told me over Twitter DM, “due to the fact that it is their fault for tweeting their coupon out.” He questioned the worthiness of anyone who would share their coupon: “How could you [be] that oblivious to the fact that you just tweeted a free Chipotle coupon out?”
Enzo, the victim, confirmed that his burrito had been nabbed by Eli. When asked how he was feeling, Enzo said, “I’m feeling hungry.” He added, “I’m not mad, hopefully he will use the money he saved by stealing my burrito to buy a nicer hat.” (Oh, snap.)
And what of the burrito itself? “I get chicken, brown rice, hot salsa (which is a key), corn cheese and lettuce,” Eli revealed.
As of this afternoon, Eli had already procured a second burrito via Twitter.
The NFL and Twitter announced earlier this morning that the social network had acquired the global rights to stream ten games of Thursday Night Football. According to Re/code, the company paid the NFL less than $10 million for the rights, “while rival bids had been higher than $15 million.” That makes this practically an act of charity.
Bloomberg adds that Twitter also beat out other telecom and tech heavyweights, including Verizon, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook. Yahoo had streamed one game online last year as a sort of trial run for the NFL, and spent $19 million for the privilege to do so.
In fact, a lot of companies own rights to broadcast games in some way or another. CBS and NBC paid $450 million for the Thursday Night rights. From Re/code:
So … I guess, congrats to the NFL more than anything else.
What’s not included in the announcement is any sense of how users will actually be able to stream the games. Twitter wants to be a “second-screen” experience — the thing you look at while also watching TV — but Twitter itself doesn’t have any smart-TV apps, and its livestreaming service, Periscope, is tangential. In other words, if you want to stream the game through Twitter, you’d be doing so on your laptop, or maybe on your phone, unless Verizon’s mobile rights take precedence. This could, of course, all change before the fall. Isn’t watching sports in 2016 fun?
Most likely, though, we’ll end up with a new user interface that places a timeline and the video feed in proximity to each other, maybe housed in an entirely separate app. (Though the last time Twitter tried to move an entire topic of discussion into a separate program, we ended up with the “Twitter Music” app, which, if you don’t remember it, exactly.)
The enormously successful NFL won’t save Twitter entirely, but shares in the company rose four percent when news of the deal broke on Wall Street. Plus, people in 185 countries around the globe will get to watch ten football games for free, thanks to the same app that lets them tweet “daddy” at the Pope and Bernie Sanders. Cool.
If there’s one thing Americans love, it’s privacy. If there’s another thing they love, it’s sacrificing privacy in the hopes of improving security. A new poll taken over the past two days by the firm Morning Consult about Apple’s legal standoff against the FBI found that a majority of Americans (54 percent) believe that their “personal information and data would be less secure” if Apple is forced to unlock the iPhone owned by San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook — but a majority (51 percent) still believe Apple should comply with the order.
Those numbers would seem to contradict the easy narrative that Americans are supporting the FBI because they don’t understand enough about the case to realize what’s at stake. (Maybe basing your opinions on all Americans against some tech people you follow on Twitter isn’t the best way to come to any real conclusions.)
Morning Consult also found that, of tech CEOs, Apple’s Tim Cook is second-most popular only to Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg; they received 39 and 48 percent favorable opinions, respectively. While framed by Morning Consult as a positive — second-most favorable! — when paired with the recent finding from Pew Research Center that 51 percent of Americans support the government in its fight to force Apple to write software that will allow it to break into iPhones, it doesn’t sound quite as good.
Notably, five Americans came out strongly in support of the FBI last night: our fine, remaining Republican candidates. Marco Rubio, previously Silicon Valley’s No. 1 suck-up in the race, said, “They are not asking Apple to create a backdoor to encryption … Apple doesn’t want to do it, because they think it hurts their brand.” That may hurt his chances with whatever Republicans he might’ve been able to round up in tech; Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook said yesterday they intend to file amicus briefs in support of Apple.
A Texas teenager recently posted a photo on Tumblr of her new T-shirt, which features the entire script of Bee Movie, Jerry Seinfeld’s 2007 animated film about bees, printed in type so small it’s nearly illegible. Her photo has 133,000 notes. People are nuts for this shirt. What? Why?
See, there’s a thriving Bee Movie fandom on Tumblr, which is not so much about the movie itself, but about the script. It’s a big, huge block of text that no one really cares about, which makes it perfect to send to friends as a prank. And 17-year-old Madison had pulled off the real-life version of this very good internet prank by putting it on her shirt.
Madison explained to BuzzFeed that her commitment to the Bee Movie bit started way before she got the shirt. She and her friends adopted it as an inside joke years ago, before it became mainstream on Tumblr:
“One year, my friend Jenna signed my yearbook with as much of the script as she could fit; another, Cassady, received the Bee Movie on DVD as a gift and forced all of her friends to suffer through it on principle.”
She told BuzzFeed her casual selfie of the T-shirt blew up so quickly overnight that people she’d never met started approaching her to talk about it. It would appear that 100,000 Tumblr notes is the threshold that makes you a local high-school celebrity.
As for the shirt, Madison said it was a gift from a friend, created by another Tumblr user. You can buy one on Redbubble if you’re the kind of person who believes that according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
But be warned that this cool meme has now received significant mainstream attention, and will now begin a gradual descent into the internet’s scrapyard. Within months, teenagers will stop liking it, and some major national brand will tweet “more like bae movie! lol.” So it goes.
The question is whether this particular kind of attention is the good kind. The internet’s aggressive need to solve and theorize isn’t limited to TV, after all, and while it can be harnessed for good results — as in the case of a John Doe positively identified 20 years after his death — the crowdsourced amateur investigation tends to misidentify and wrongfully accuse, often with tragic results. It’s one thing to use the resources of the web to expand your knowledge of the case or fact-check the documentarians. It’s another to treat the people involved like characters you can ship on Tumblr. Proposing Teresa Halbach’s ex-boyfriend as a suspect is the kind of message-board speculation that seems natural in the context of the long wait between seasons of a hot TV show. But Ryan Hillegas is a real, living human being, and accusing him of murder on evidence much less convincing than that which convicted Avery can’t possibly be the best way to address the wrongs documented in Making a Murderer.
The trending-topic single-mindedness of social media and the desperate need of publishers to adopt the vernacular of internet fandom to gain traction with audiences only exacerbate the slippage between real crime and fiction. And there are other obvious by-products of this flavor of obsession: Best Buy mistakenly tried to use its status as a crucial setting in the Serial investigation as a real-time marketing opportunity. When the New York Times sent a news update about Robert Durst’s apparent murder confession in the final episode of The Jinx, people complained of spoilers.
Making a Murderer has been subject to some of the same kinds of awkwardness: On Sunday, actress Kristen Bell tweeted a cutesy romantic image of Avery’s defense attorneys, Dean Strang and Jerry Buting, whose spirited defense of Avery has received a huge amount of deserved admiration and respect. There’s a Twitter account devoted to Strang. Others have limited themselves to spending a good five seconds crafting the obvious joke.
It’s not that people are oblivious to the realities of true crime. When Best Buy sent that ill-advised tweet — “We have everything you need. Unless you need a payphone. #Serial” — the outcry was enough to force a public apology. Slate argued that the particular anger at Best Buy — and not at, say, Sesame Street, which produced its own jokey Serial tweet — was a result of the electronics store trying to financially profit off of a brutal crime.
But just because Serial or Making a Murderer adopt some of the same tactics as fiction TV shows we love doesn’t mean they need to be treated in the same way. If Making a Murderer were a several-thousand-word magazine article — and it’s not difficult to imagine it as one — it would be regarded as an excellent piece of advocacy journalism about the horrific state of the criminal-justice system, not as a mystery to be debated or definitively solved through crowdsourced amateur sleuthing.
And certainly not as a resource for memes or riffs. There are lots of unknowns surrounding that first season of Serial, but there are also many indisputable facts, chief among them that a teenager was violently murdered, her body left in a Baltimore park undiscovered for nearly a month. That fact is now never far from my mind when I see things like this graphic that BuzzFeed made for one of its Serial posts:
That’s … fuckin’ weird, right? To see a doge meme that reminds you of a strangled teenager? I don’t think anyone created it out of cruelty, and arguably, the meme is actually “about” the obsession, not the murder itself. But the juxtaposition of actual tragedy with the glib, mechanical vernacular of internet culture just serves as another reminder of how ill-equipped the latter is to deal with the former.
If you haven’t yet watched Making a Murderer, the ten-part Netflix documentary that examines in detail the muddy and possibly fabricated murder case against Steven Avery, a notoriously wrongly imprisoned Wisconsin man, you’ve probably seen one of the many blog posts written about the series. Or maybe you’ve come across a heated discussion on Facebook about Avery’s guilt or innocence. Or maybe you’ve glanced at one of the many Reddit threads devoted to untangling some of the trial’s more complicated pieces of evidence. Or maybe you just know about it because the parody account devoted to Avery’s defense lawyers was retweeted into your feed.
The internet has taken to Making a Murderer just as it took to the This American Life podcast Serial and HBO’s documentary The Jinx. True crime, as a genre of nonfiction, is booming, and it’s thanks in part to an obsessive web culture essentially built to consume, discuss, debate, theorize, and riff on serialized narratives. But if the internet’s culture machine is perfect for prestige television and genre-film franchises, it’s less sure-footed when it comes to real-life stories of tragedy and injustice, and the sudden boom in Making a Murderer memes and theories has been a curious — and somewhat discomfiting — development.
You could trace the development of How We Talk About TV Online back as far as Star Trek, and likely farther, but the key product of the last two decades, as far as setting the tone for internet discussion, is Lost. That show, with its vague weekly hints and seasons-long mysteries, gave rise to a rabid pop culture obsessed with cracking the case, so to speak. As critic Andy Greenwald explained in his retrospective last year, Lost “arrived at a moment when Wikipedia-size wormholes were available to every viewer, when fan engagement migrated from the fringes to the very center of mainstream conversation.”
Lost was a show built for a growing class of digital-native pop-culture fans, comfortable with scrubbing through video slowly and repeatedly, and compiling databases of clues and theories, doing research away from the TV set. Audiences mined every image, character, and line of dialogue for clues, many of which never went anywhere.
That constant and ever-present conversation, barreling toward some unknown conclusion, has permeated the way that we digest popular culture online, and somewhere along the way, Theories became the main unit of discussion when fans talked about all entertainment, not just science fiction. Don Draper is D.B. Cooper, Megan Draper is Sharon Tate, and Jar Jar Binks is a Sith Lord. “What happened on the final episode of The Sopranos?” wasn’t just a five-minute watercooler speculation — it was also a mystery to be theorized, debated, and, over the objections of series creator David Chase, solved.
And in the past year or so, this once-obsessive, now-normal type of fandom has expanded to the genre of true crime, in ways that are entirely understandable and, upon closer scrutiny, pretty weird. This all obviously starts with and branches out from Serial, a legitimate cultural phenomenon that inspired thousands of amateur sleuths to investigate the murder of Hae Min Lee, for which Adnan Syed was convicted in 2000. It now includes critical and cultural darlings like The Jinx and Making a Murderer, both of which have feverishly attended subreddits devoted to their respective cases, and will also likely include upcoming bandwagon-hoppers like Discovery’s Killing Fields.
To the extent that the amateur-detective attitude is the internet’s dominant mode of cultural consumption, the only surprising thing about the sudden ascendancy of true-crime nonfiction is how long it took. The key innovation was probably the thing that gives Serial its title. The serialized narrative, riddled with gaps in which speculation and discussion can flourish, is the dominant cultural form of the social media era. A true-crime documentary that can be presented in the same terms as a fiction TV show — a gripping whodunit whose chapters end in cliff-hangers — will activate the same regions of internet obsession.
This is obviously intentional on the part of Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos, Making a Murderer’s filmmakers — the ten-episode show could easily have been a two-hour documentary aired, and likely quickly forgotten, on HBO — and, as far as tactics go, it’s hard to argue against it. The series was obviously made to call attention to Avery and his nephew’s convictions, and it’s succeeded at that. Making the public more aware of the myriad failures of the criminal-justice system, and of unsolved mysteries or questionable convictions, is an unambiguously good thing.
Set in a medieval fantasy world full of dragons and ghouls, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, offers players many choices, and reacts accordingly. Will players rule the realm? Will they practice the dark arts? Will they adopt a dog? The possibilities are endless, as Patrick Lenton recalls.
What a roller coaster. Congratulations to that virtual dog.
Thanks for nothing, kangaroos, you adorable little necrophiliacs.
News outlets from around the world recently carried the heartrending story of a dying female kangaroo reaching for her joey in her last moments, while her male partner seemed to be lifting her up to check on her. But all of the sadness directed at the fallen marsupial turned very strange when experts pointed out that the male kangaroo wasn’t being sweet … he was being horny.
Outlets like People shared a sentimental description of the scene from the photographer who captured it, Evan Switzer: “I saw the male pick up the female, he looked like he was just trying to get her up and see what was wrong with her,” Switzer said. “He would lift her up and she wouldn’t stand she’d just fall to the ground, he’d nudge her, stand beside her.”
But anthropologists weren’t so moved by the male ‘roo’s gesture. Dr. Derek Spielman, a University of Sydney professor, told the New York Post he had “no doubt” the kangaroo was trying to have sex with his dying mate.
Spielman explained that competition for sex is fierce among male kangaroos, and they often violently harass females, sometimes even killing them in the process. It’s pretty grim out there in the outback, it turns out.
“[Killing] is not their intention but that unfortunately can be the result,” Spielman explained, “so interpreting the male’s actions as being based on care for the welfare of the female or the joey is a gross misunderstanding.”
He chalked up all the “aww”-ing over the cute kangaroo couple to “naïve anthropomorphism.” Once again, nature notches a sick burn against the downtrodden public who just wanted to have something nice for once.
Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent to Twitter, has announced that it is dropping the 140-character limit that had partially defined the service in the past. Starting next week, according to the BBC, it will roll out the ability for users to write longer posts, although the text will be similarly truncated when they appear in users’ feeds.
“Senior users” will gain access to the uncapped service first, and the rollout will continue through the end of February. As Weibo CEO Wang Gaofei explained, “During the pilot run, only 140 characters will be displayed in followers’ feeds and a link will appear to show the entire content if a post exceeds the character limit.”
The move is similar to one Twitter is reported to be considering: increasing the tweet character limit to 10,000, truncating posts in users’ timelines, and requiring them to click to expand. Jack Dorsey hinted as much when he addressed the rumor indirectly. “The majority of tweets will always be short and sweet and conversational,” he wrote. But maybe there’s no need for an arbitrary character limit anymore.
While it’s very cute when dogs just flop around everywhere looking for a tummy rub, have you ever noticed how often they end up displaying their bathing-suit parts (so to speak) for the world to see? Has this shameful exposure infected your friends’ Instagrams of their pets? Losing followers because of your dog’s dick? Don’t worry, here’s a pro tip: Emoji stickers can help preserve your dog’s modesty.
Writer and podcast host Jaime Green recently adopted a Brussels Griffon–Shih Tzu mix and named him Hercules Mulligan (see Hamilton). She was snapping photos of Mulligan one day when something struck her. “I realized how attention-grabbing the dog’s wiener is in pictures,” she says. The solution was an app called Kawaii Photo Booth, which is usually used to add cutesy stickers to selfies, but in this case acts as a helpful censor.
Sometimes Hercules has a skull over his junk. Other times it’s a heart. A happy watermelon makes a great modesty patch! “There I wanted to cover his whole package, so I needed something long,” Green says. “I like a sense of personality in the sticker.”
Has p.c. culture gone too far?! Instagram is notoriously stringent about nudity, and while its terms of service don’t explicitly forbid dog genitalia (as opposed to human nipples), you can’t blame pet owners for being cautious. Plus, there’s a tradition involved: Green’s inspiration for the sticker came from the old-school blogger Dooce, who always censored her dogs.
It’s not just any emoji that’s appropriate for covering up, however. Green says the symbolism has to be carefully considered. “I’ve been avoiding things that are explicitly phallic. Like, I’d never use a banana. That’s too much.”
There’s a whole world of sticker-censored dogs out there. Check out the #modestdog hashtag on Instagram, where pet owners flaunt their sticker usage. Juno the corgi sports a star, though the pup clearly couldn’t care less.
Since the dawn of time, every day a dog doing something good takes over social media. So it is written in the great book; so it shall be throughout time. Today the honor belongs to this pup dancing to Toto’s “Africa.” Loop infinitely and let this Vine cure what’s deep inside you. The wild dogs cry out in the night; it’s gonna take a lot to drag him away from you.
The Vine is inspired by the account Art_Hoe 2.0, which has created and collaborated on plenty of viral audio mash-ups using this particular dancing dog among others. Like this remix with Dancing Man:
Eight­-bit dance!

Tech companies — including Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook, Snapchat, and Yahoo — are signing amicus briefs in support of Apple in its case against the federal government, which has asked Apple to unlock the phone of one of the San Bernardino terrorists. This in and of itself is not particularly surprising — the case has clear implications beyond Apple — but, according to the New York Times, Apple’s peers were not initially quite so ready to jump into the fray.
The main reason cited by the Times: This specific case is too controversial to pick a fight with the government over — and lots of tech companies have large contracts with the government they fear could be jeopardized. The Times quotes Keith Rabois, a prominent venture capitalist:
Those are credible reasons. But it’s also hard to wonder if Apple CEO Tim Cook’s strong previous criticism of his rivals hasn’t made them a small amount less willing to speak up on his behalf. In February 2015, Cook spoke about cybersecurity at President Obama’s Cybersecurity Summit at Stanford, in which he subtweeted the ad-driven business models of Facebook, Yahoo, and Google. Notably not present at the event: Mark Zuckerberg, Marissa Mayer, Larry Page, and Eric Schmidt:
“I’m speaking to you from Silicon Valley, where some of the most prominent and successful companies have built their businesses by lulling their customers into complacency about their personal information,” he said, again taking shots at Google, Facebook, and Yahoo in a June 2015 speech to the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “They’re gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it. We think that’s wrong. And it’s not the kind of company that Apple wants to be … You might like these so-called free services, but we don’t think they’re worth having your email, your search history, and now even your family photos data mined and sold off for god-knows-what advertising purpose.”
So, yes, phone usage during movies isn’t going away any time soon. It probably never will. But we don’t need to hasten this process. If I had to bet, for every moviegoer attracted to the idea of texting during a film, there’s another who sees it as another reason to avoid the theater entirely.
We all knew this day would come. Variety is reporting that the CEO of movie-theater company AMC is considering “making some theaters texting and mobile device-friendly” in a bid to attract younger audiences. This is a bad move, but not a surprising one. The young people love to use their apps, and public decorum can frick off.
“When you tell a 22-year-old to ‘turn off the phone, don’t ruin the movie,’ they hear ‘please cut off your left arm above the elbow,’” CEO Adam Aron said. “You can’t tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That’s not how they live their life.”
That’s hyperbolic, but he’s certainly not incorrect. The issue with this potential new move is that it explicitly condones using one’s phone during a movie, which most people would consider rude.
Using your phone during a movie is a bit like jaywalking. Yeah, you shouldn’t do it, but it’s often convenient, and who’s gonna stop you? The act is self-regulating: If you pull out your phone during a movie, you also accept the potential consequences (a few angry glares, getting called an asshole). Giving audience members carte blanche to whip out their devices whenever they’d like will embolden them and disrupt the unwritten risk-reward system of phone use already in place.
The fact of the matter is that phone use during movies is happening — more and more regularly — whether we’d like it to or not. I’m a senior citizen (25 years old, same difference) with a degree in film studies, so I vote against. Yet I know that this is a losing battle. At this point, I’m just trying to have this transition happen at a natural pace.
As a culture, we’ve been debating this issue for years. Back in 2013, Anil Dash argued that those who objected to talking and phone use during a screening were engaging in a type of 21st-century colonialism (or something? The argument is … muddled).
In response, Richard Lawson wrote, “the real crux of the matter is that everyone mutually agreeing to do nothing but watch the movie is a more reasonable request, in a logical and even factual way, than expecting everyone to just put up with whatever the person next to them wants to do.”
As someone who (gasp) occasionally checks his phone during the movie, I can say that there are ways to check your phone unobtrusively. A little effort goes a long way. Don’t raise your phone up. This is the easiest thing in the world, but some people can’t do it, for God knows why. Keep your phone in your lap. If someone behind you can read your screen over your shoulder, the phone is too high. Turn down the brightness on your screen. Again, this is really obvious but people forget. Swipe that slider all the way left. I guarantee your screen will still be bright enough. Now here’s an expert-level pro move: Invert the colors on your screen. Since most apps contain dark text on a light background, inverting the colors makes it much less disruptive to turn on your phone in the dark. On iOS, you can use the settings menu to tie color inversion to triple-tapping the Home button, making it easy to toggle on and off, as needed.
Robotics company Boston Dynamics, creators of the Big Dog robot, has released a Christmas video in which Santa’s sled is pulled by robotic reindeer. Noooope.
Can Google’s search algorithms write a dating profile more potent and interesting than that of any mere human man? Of course. We will all be replaced by the machines as we’re dragged kicking and screaming toward the Singularity. And the machine that will get the most laid is this guy, whose attributes are composed entirely of Google autocomplete results:
If you’re a boozed-up flat-earther with a car hobby, get in touch with TechnicallyRon as soon as possible. He won’t be available for long, obviously. It’s a seller’s market out there for any eligible specimen who gets turned on by cuddling and depression.
And if you are a mortal flesh-man hoping to compete in the stringent and exacting dating scene created as we act on software and software acts on us, back and forth forever, do not lose hope. TechnicallyRon is available to write your dating profile, as well. It’s going to cost you, though.
The 2015 list also includes some memes that sadly didn’t survive until the end of the year: RIP Left Shark, Texts From Last Night, and "squad goals." We hardly knew ye. And yet, in some ways, we knew you far too well and for far too long.
Further emphasizing the ever-shortening half-life of the contemporary internet meme, 2015’s list only contained a handful of carryovers from 2014. They included Throwback Thursday, teens joking about the contents of the PSAT test, and the Halloween meme Skeleton War. Also making a repeat appearance was that ubiquitous Shiba inu Doge, which was long ago hailed by people with taste as the only “actually good internet meme.” Doge fell six spots, from No. 8 to No. 14. Such reliable. Very consistency.
Tumblr’s annual list of the most reblogged memes is out, and it turns out that 2015’s Tumblr teens were really, really into Pepe, a weird-looking drawing of a frog that’s been kicking around the infamous image-board site 4chan since at least 2008.
Pepe started out in 2005 as a web-comics character in Matt Furie’s strip Boy’s Club, but a panel where the frog looks especially satisfied and says “Feels good man” turned out to be a perfect reaction image for any revolting thread on 4chan’s anything-goes forum, /b/.
New illustrations of Pepe followed, and internet artists got into a sort of arms race to see who could draw him into the most surreal and most disgusting situations. These original works are known as “rare Pepes,” because their comedy value hasn’t yet been depleted through endless repetition, and people on Tumblr were obsessed with producing and collecting them this year.
Tumblrs like Daily Rare Pepes and Mega Pepe Mart sprung up to provide the masses with the dank new Pepes they craved, helping to put the frog at the top of this year’s Tumblr meme ranking, seven years after he got big on 4chan. Fitzgerald famously wrote that there are no second acts in American lives. Clearly, 1920s meme technology just wasn’t capable of producing any memes as good and dank as Pepe the Frog.
Other notable newcomers to the list:
At No. 2, “the signs as.” It’s a game where you assign astrological signs to any group of things: your friends, Pokémon, McDonald’s Dollar Menu items. Anything, really.
At No. 4, breadsticks — a way of announcing that you’re leaving a conversation. As in, “*shoving breadsticks into my purse* sorry i have to go right now immediately.”
At No. 5, the Dress, a photo of a blue-and-black dress that spawned the most popular post in BuzzFeed’s history after people mistakenly saw it as gold and white.
If that’s when the catheter (or catheter prank) was built, Blow hasn’t been using it for long — just during the final push to finish the game over the past week or so. But why would you pause during crunch time to build a piss-rig as a joke? To have a little fun and alleviate the stress of the deadline? Occam’s razor would suggest a simpler explanation: Maybe he really peed into this thing!
Jonathan Blow responded to the curiosity and furor over how he chooses to relieve himself by … being Jonathan Blow, the same self-serious creator gamers have been lovingly mocking for years.
Blow has previously accused fans of missing the point of Braid. Now it looks like they also missed the point of a photo of a piss-bottle. Will true art ever win?
Jonathan Blow, creator of the hit indie video game Braid and one of the subjects of the 2012 documentary Indie Game: The Movie, is just days away from releasing his new game, the Witness. It’s been in various stages of development since 2008, and now it’s finally here. But this isn’t a story about video games; it’s a story about something else Blow just released: a photo of what appears to be his homemade catheter, hooked up to a bottle of his own urine. Curveball!
Video-Games Twitter is in a tizzy about the possible pee-pee habits of Blow, an eccentric auteur who’s been alternately hailed as the savior of video games — back before it was widely understood that games could be art — and mocked as a precious, pretentious blowhard.
Was Blow really peeing through a tube, or was he just screwing with his audience? Wouldn’t it be faster to take a bathroom break than to build a catheter? His single tweet on the subject offers little in the way of answers.
PC Gamer is out there asking the tough questions, though: “Is this merely a tub of apple juice, or is it a stinging indictment on video game development crunch time? Is that the right colour for pee? Does the lighting influence its hue?”
The site didn’t get to the bottom of the mystery, but it tracked down one crucial clue: a tweet from Blow a few days before, asking for help locating some plastic tubing.
Many people hate Facebook for its enormous size and inescapability. Everyone hates Ticketmaster for more or less the same reasons. (The big difference between the two seems to be that Facebook usually works.) So it is with great trepidation, bordering on outright despondency, that I inform you that Facebook and Ticketmaster — two of the internet’s most widely disliked companies — are joining forces: You will soon be able to buy tickets from Ticketmaster directly through Facebook and its accompanying apps.
“By putting the ability to buy tickets directly within Facebook we hope that we’re going to provide a more seamless purchase experience and sell more tickets,” Ticketmaster executive Dan Armstrong told BuzzFeed. Extremely cool. I definitely want to help perpetuate a frustrating ticketing system — “the product of what even Ticketmaster executives acknowledge is 30 years of patches and workarounds,” as a 2010 Wired article put it — make more money through outrageous service charges and give Facebook the inside scoop on my musical interests, so it can then sell me more tickets.
This is just the most recent example of Facebook’s current pitch to be the medium through which everything else on the internet happens: Tickets through Facebook, customer service and other kinds of shopping through Messenger, easier media distribution via Instant Articles, and so on and so forth. Think of it: You can try to buy tickets on Facebook, encounter an unhelpful Ticketmaster customer service representative, and complain about the entire experience, all without leaving Facebook.
The internet was supposed to be a great equalizer. Now the largest social network and the largest ticketing enterprise have combined into a horrible Voltron of commerce and cultural capitalism.
The worst part is that I know I’m probably going to use it.
And now it does again, maybe.
Plus, with the stresses of public shaming, bad Twitter, internet white supremacists, and a toxic political culture that isn’t going away until November (if ever), it feels like a vacation to the friendly confines of the new old internet is exactly what we need right now.
“This is my new internet, I’m done with the old one,” Andy Baio wrote Thursday night. Baio has been blogging forever, helped build Kickstarter, and co-founded the XOXO festival. If you’re looking for your “new internet,” he’s someone to pay attention to. And his is a fascinating, retro-styled video simulcasting site called 1080plus. It’s basically a YouTube you can watch with your friends, but with an aesthetic straight out of the mid-’90s. Turns out your new internet is refreshingly old internet.
1080plus was built by a Canadian developer named Michael, who envisioned it as “a project to make a multiplayer theater experience where you could join friends in a virtual world / virtual theater staring at the same virtual silver screen together, and talking about it as it plays.”
And it is that, but, like any piece of software, the users will decide what it’s really for. Some use it like Baio does, to host online video-viewing parties and play VJ, but most are just using it like a more fun hipster version of YouTube.
“I must say that the website has two main audiences,” Michael wrote. “One audience uses many features like simulcasting and chat, while many thousands of other users just come to the 1080plus website to quickly watch a video, read a few comments and leave again.”
Either way is fine, honestly. Web design in 2016 has become flat and boring — to the point that it’s even starting to hinder usability — and it’s understandable that we’d yearn for the more earnest, enthusiastic visual sensibilities of the wide-eyed days of Windows 95 and GeoCities. Back then, computers seemed cool, not like an obligatory part of the furniture. A gaudy, cyberpunk “control panel” like the one in 1080plus felt like some kind of magic.
A 20-year-old Norwegian explained to a curious reporter this week that she was born with an unusual genetic defect: She’s a cat. In an interview that’s been viewed 350,000 times on YouTube, 20-year-old Nano reveals she came to terms with her feline nature at 16, and has been living as a domestic cat ever since.
Nano told reporter Silje Ese that a psychologist said she could grow out it — out of being an actual cat in a human body — but she doubts it. She’d rather continue wearing ears and cleaning herself with furry, paw-shaped gloves, she said as she crawled around an Oslo train station, meowing.
“I think I’ll be a cat all my life.”
And why not? Being a cat gives Nano some minor superpowers, she claims, like the ability to see in the dark and hear especially well. A fair trade-off for a life spent crawling on hands and knees, pawing at windows when she wants to be let out? Maybe. If she runs into trouble, she can always just … speak like a human, as she demonstrated by giving an interview explaining her cat-ness.
Is Nano a furry? By some definition, maybe, but she doesn’t separate her human personality from a “fursona,” or wear a costume for role-playing, like many furries do. And her cat identity doesn’t seem to be a sexual thing, like those of many — but, okay, not all — furries. She doesn’t want to be an anthropomorphic, two-legged, cartoonish cat.
And she’s not a human who has multiple personalities, one of which is a cat—like her poser friend Sven. Whatever, Sven.
She just believes she’s a cat. And that means she’s gonna hiss at dogs, be afraid of water, and ignore psychologists if she wants to. So leave her alone, okay?
In a blog post today, Twitter announced that it would restore Politwoops, the tool that archived the deleted tweets of public officials. Politwoops, operated by the Sunlight Foundation, had its access to Twitter’s API revoked earlier this year. This was in part because Twitter was not too keen on allowing services to house data from Twitter elsewhere. “Honoring the expectation of user privacy for all accounts is a priority for us, whether the user is anonymous or a member of Congress,” they said at the time.
This assertion was, as Twitter now implicitly acknowledges, bullshit. Of course government officials conducting government business through Twitter should expect less privacy and to have their remarks retained permanently. Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, implied Politwoops’s resurrection in October when he stated in part, “We have a responsibility to continue to empower organizations that bring more transparency to public dialogue, such as Politwoops.”
Politicians should not be able to assume that they can wipe their remarks from the public record. Probably the best example of this is the case of Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who spent five years in captivity in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Many members of Congress prayed for him and welcomed him home on Twitter, but after reports began to come out that Bergdahl abandoned his post, those same members of Congress deleted their tweets. Politwoops archived them, exposing their hypocrisy.
It might have taken them half a year, but it’s nice that Twitter finally realized it didn’t need to cover for elected officials.
Snapchat says it created the filter “in partnership with the Bob Marley Estate, and gives people a new way to share their appreciation for Bob Marley and his music. Millions of Snapchatters have enjoyed Bob Marley’s music, and we respect his life and achievements.” (The Marley estate, House of Marley, is co-administered by Marley’s family and an American licensing company called Authentic Brands Group.)
It’s great to celebrate Marley, a legendary musician and icon for peace and justice. But maybe there were better days to do it on?
Meanwhile, Facebook’s MSQRD app has a “Rasta” and an “Obama” filter. Neither have received much attention yet, meaning either no one is using MSQRD, or that no one who uses MSQRD thinks that hard about what it means to superimpose black faces over faces of people of other races.
In honor of today’s holiday (if you don’t know, ask a teen), Snapchat rolled out a “Bob Marley-inspired” selfie filter — one that gives you dreadlocks, a Rasta beanie, and, uh, a charming tint that darkens your skin, ostensibly to make you look more like the late reggae legend.
Or you know, you could just call it digital blackface. As many people on Twitter have (not that it’s stopped them from using it, of course):
Wyclef is just the latest in a long line of AMAs gone wrong. There’s even a subreddit devoted to the topic. AMA stands for “Ask Me Anything” and redditors take that “anything seriously. Woody Harrelson’s AMA went awry after a user claimed that Harrelson once crashed a prom party and took a teenager’s virginity. Harrelson tried to keep discussion focused on the movie he was promoting and took a lot of crap for doing so. In the non-celeb arena, the CEO of REI once caught flak when an employee criticized the company’s management.
In general, asking web users to comment on a celebrity in an unfiltered environment is a terrible PR move. In November of 2014, Bill Cosby invited users to “Meme me!” with the hashtag #CosbyMeme. You can guess what happened next.
More than you might expect, holding a Q&A session on Reddit has become one of a celebrity’s biggest liabilities. The upsides are obvious: If you’re a celebrity free of major controversy, you can appear down-to-earth, speaking directly with fans and promoting your latest project. But if at any point you’ve been hit with allegations of impropriety, steer clear of Reddit. As the saying goes, “The internet never forgets.”
The latest victim of AMA-cide is Wyclef Jean, who took to Reddit to answer questions about the Fugees’ landmark album The Score for its 20th anniversary. Instead, he was beset by years-old allegations that his charity, the Yele Haiti Foundation, established in the wake of a disastrous earthquake, misused funds to pay for things like recording-studio rent and mistresses.
The most-upvoted question (4,646 points) as of right now begins, “Hi Wyclef, I have a question for you, how do you sleep at night knowing that the money people were donating to your charity Yele could have been spent improving the lives of ‘your people’ but instead you spent it on yourself and your celebrity friends?”
Following the barrage of questions, Jean quickly deleted his account, which also caused all of his responses to vanish as well.
An archived version of the page does include a few of his now-vanished responses, in which he claims that readers did not have all of the facts.
Even for questions not regarding the allegations, Wyclef was unable to catch a break.
Two best friends, Bo and Matthew — Bo a Seattle stand-up comedian and comedy host and Matthew a guy named Matthew — recently announced that they had achieved their lifelong dream of getting into a movie theater on the same ticket by disguising themselves as one large man.
The windup to the prank, which takes up the first three minutes or so of the video, is not essential. Skip to their attempt to sneak in. Despite the obvious, conspicuous lump attached to his body, Bo buys a single ticket and waddles right into the theater area, letting Matthew out of the disguise once they’re safely inside an elevator.
How did the ticket seller not notice something unusual was going on? According to one source, he did — he just didn’t want to risk being wrong.
A YouTube commenter claims her dad is the general manager of the theater Bo and Matthew sneaked into, and when she showed him the video, she said he thought it was hilarious. Although the video was filmed almost a year ago — notice they’re buying a ticket to the 2015 Avengers — the employee who sold them the ticket apparently remembered that day.
According to the tipster in the YouTube comments, “[He] didn’t want to say anything because there are people who actually have medical conditions that make them look like that. It would be horrifying to ask someone with that genuine condition ‘Hey, do you have another person hiding under your clothes?’”
A lesson learned: To pull off this trick, you don’t need to convince anyone. You just have to make them feel awkward enough that it’s easier not to ask. Seems like a lot of work for a $15 movie ticket, but hey, to each his own. Or their own, in this case.
Though much of 4chan’s technical structure — strict anonymity (as distinct from pseudonymity) and no archives — makes it difficult to generalize its community, it’s safe to say that /pol/ is where the most serious and committed racists on 4chan tend to congregate. To the extent that there is a shared political ideology across /pol/, it’s a heavily ironic mix of garden-variety white supremacy and neo-reactionary movements, with attendant interest in Ron Paul (who has been memed into a kind of apocalyptic prophet since losing the 2008 Republican primary), European history, and masculine strength. “Most days,” the Daily Beast’s Jacob Siegel wrote earlier this year, “/pol/ resembles nothing so much as The Daily Stormer [a notorious white-supremacist blog] with the signal to noise dial turned only slightly.”
Of course, /pol/ is hardly the only place white supremacists congregate online. There are abundant subreddits, a message board called Sheekyforums, and, of course, email.
But the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Keegan Hankes says, “[Y]ou can’t understate 4chan’s role.” He tells Siegel: “I constantly see 4chan being mentioned by the more Internet- and tech-savvy guys in the white nationalist movement. They’re getting their content from 4chan.”
After Dylann Roof killed nine black worshippers at a Charleston church in June, a thread on /pol/ had users sharing when they became racist.
The dark joke about /b/ was that it was the first place web-savvy journalists would check after a school shooting. As /pol/’s influence increases in white-supremacist and right-wing politics — and if its members keep filming themselves waving guns near peaceful protests — it might find itself with a similar dubious honor.
On Tuesday morning, after the shooting of five Black Lives Matter protesters in Minneapolis, a chilling video from LiveLeak resurfaced on Facebook and in news media: two armed men, in camouflage and balaclavas, spewing racist invective as they filmed themselves driving to Thursday’s Black Lives Matter protest. “We’re going to shut the camera off in a little bit,” one who identifies himself as SaigaMarine says. “We just wanted to give everyone a heads up on /pol/.” He signs off by pointing at the camera and saying, “Stay white.”
Sun This Week, a local Minneapolis paper, is now reporting that the other man in the video, BlackPowderRanger, is Lance Scarsella, a 23-year-old arrested and charged with assault for the shooting. And it’s widely believed by activists on Twitter that SaigaMarine — a YouTuber, model, and frequent poster to 4chan, the anarchic image board — is the 32-year-old Hispanic man who was arrested on Tuesday and released when police confirmed he was not at the protests on Monday night. (Two other suspects are also in custody in relation to the shooting.)
It’s unsurprising to people who’ve been reading it to hear that /pol/, 4chan’s politics forum, was invoked in this video. Media coverage of 4chan tends to focus on /b/, the site’s performatively offensive “random” board (birthplace of lolcats, Rickrolling, and more harassment campaigns than anyone can remember), but /pol/ has rapidly become the site’s most toxic community — as well as increasingly (and bizarrely) influential in online white-supremacist politics.
/b/ tends to be a stand-in for 4chan as a whole, but it’s hardly the site’s only community: There’s /v/, for gamers, for example, or /a/, for anime and manga. Each has a lively community — but none might be as devoted and intricate as that of /pol/, or Politically Incorrect, which shares /b/’s gleeful disorder and wanton offensiveness, but focuses those qualities exclusively on politics and world events.
News and politics were, in the early years of 4chan, the province of the /new/ board. But by 2011, /new/ had become too racist for even 4chan, and Christopher Poole (aka moot), 4chan’s creator, shut it down. /pol/ was created to fill the vacancy.
It’s easy to draw a direct line between /pol/ and /b/. Threads in both sections generally feature an OP — original poster — asking a seemingly sincere question and then people just yelling into the cybervoid underneath it. Nobody really speaks directly to one another; they just spout hateful things with abandon. But since /b/ has come under direct scrutiny from journalists and academics, its already-considerable underlying sense of self-awareness has increased. There’s an understanding that /b/ is under the microscope, and a consequent increase in the performance of offensiveness.
As /b/ gets too large and notorious to maintain its reputation as the web’s worst place, other 4chan boards have popped up in the news with new frequency. /k/, the firearms board on which SaigaMarine is apparently a frequent poster, is largely civil and polite (politics discussion is banned); /r9k/, a social-outcast board implicated in the Umpqua Community College shootings earlier this year, is dark and negative but mostly self-pitying. /pol/, on the other hand, is as bilious as /b/ — and has dispensed entirely with its already-thin veneer of “trolling.” People are racist and hateful on /pol/ not for attention or reaction, but because they are. It’s jeering and ironic in the manner of all anonymous online discussion, but when people are filming themselves pointing guns at the camera and saying “stay white,” it’s hard to get the joke.
Abe Vigoda, TV star and longtime character actor, died on Tuesday at the age of 94. The veteran actor has a long list of accomplishments onscreen, but he was also the subject of one of the web’s longest-running death hoaxes.
In fact, Vigoda’s death was first reported in 1982, when People mistakenly referred to the actor as “the late Abe Vigoda.” Since then, the assumption that Vigoda had died followed him around. It didn’t bother him, though. In 2001, he told the New York Times that “People have known for some time that I’m alive. People don’t seem to stop me and ask me anymore. They seem to know.”
In 2001, abevigoda.com launched with a simple mission: to let the public known the status of Abe Vigoda. (An archived version of the site pre-death is here; only one word is different.)
The similar isabevigodadead.com, which just featured the sentence “No.” has been updated as well.
While the websites have updated, on Twitter, @AbeVigodaUpdate is learning a valuable lesson about hardcoding values into your bot.
Storm Desmund, which continues to hit northwestern U.K., is no joke — flood warnings remain in place for many areas. But Irish weather reporter Teresa Mannion went viral for her almost excessively cautionary performance on television from Galway. “DON’T MAKE UNNECESSARY JOURNEYS, DON’T TAKE RISKS ON TREACHEROUS ROADS, AND DON’T SWIM IN THE SEA,” she shouts above the wind and rain in the hilarious clip. For much of the weekend, Mannion’s name was trending on Twitter. For her part, she thanked her similarly bedraggled crew in a tweet.
The internet has run with Mannion’s performance, even turning it into a dance remix. What better way to experience the weather?
Everything comes in threes. Following this week’s Kanye–Wiz Khalifa and B.o.B.–Neil deGrasse Tyson rap beefs, Martin Shkreli has launched one of his own against Wu-Tang Clan member Ghostface Killah. Last week, Ghostface referred to Shkeli — who bought the only copy of the Wu-Tang Clan’s newest album for $2 million — as a “shithead.”
In a bizarre new video, Shkreli has decided to pick a fight with the rapper. “You’re an old man that’s lost his relevance, and you’re trying to reclaim the spotlight from my spotlight,” says the embattled pharmaceutical executive, who is keeping his name in the news by recording a callout video on an askew webcam surrounded by three men in Halloween masks. Shkreli then threatens to wipe Ghostface’s contributions off the album or destroy the only copy entirely.
Shrkeli, who is a bad person and no longer amusing, is demanding a written apology for the slight. He will almost definitely not get one.
In cross-examination, part of Carmichael’s testimony focused on how news organizations process email. As a not-really-smoking gun, lawyers for Hogan produced an email sent to Gawker’s tip line six months prior to the Hogan post. The email was a TMZ news blast including the detail that the Hogan tape was filmed without his knowledge. Hogan’s team was trying to establish that Gawker knew about the tape’s status, the defense then clarified that — as is common with most news-site tip lines — many of those emails go unread. Receiving an email does not mean it was read and processed. Whether the Florida jury will go along with that is another matter.
Who was the slimiest person today?Weirdly, on a day when the guy who made a sarcastic child-porn joke during a deposition testified, one of the jurors came across worse. In Florida jury trials, jurors are allowed to anonymously submit questions to witnesses; one asked Carmichael if she’d ever had an “intimate relationship” with Daulerio or Denton. This was an indirect extension of the plaintiff’s line of question about Carmichael’s training and work history, establishing her as young and without formal training. Clearly, the jury wondered if she’d come into her job by other means. Daulerio was not asked a similar question about his relationship to his colleagues.
On a day in which Gawker made its best push to emphasize that it had acted responsibly and in its readers’ interest, at least one jury member indicated that they had already made up their mind.
Did Nick Denton say anything about the post?Denton took the stand today but didn’t even get to the Hogan post. Most of his testimony so far has been to establish his work as technologically curious and to establish that site traffic is not the only or primary metric of evaluating a story or a writer’s worth.
The trial between Hulk Hogan and Gawker Media over excerpts of his sex tape continued on Monday, with three Gawker editors running through the publication process of the post in question.
In case you’re just catching up, Hogan — real name Terry Bollea — is suing Gawker and its former editor, A.J. Daulerio, over a video published on Gawker in 2012 containing excerpts from a sex tape featuring Hogan and Heather Clem, the wife of radio host Bubba the Love Sponge Clem. Four years later, Daulerio, Hogan, and Gawker founder Nick Denton are now on opposite sides of a St. Petersburg, Florida, courtroom.
Last week, Hogan’s lawyers made their case. Jurors were shown taped depositions of Daulerio, Denton, Jezebel editor-in-chief Emma Carmichael (at the time Gawker’s managing editor), and Gawker Media executive editor John Cook (at the time a senior writer). Of these, the most memorable was Daulerio’s, thanks to a dumb joke that, while clearly a joke, was also about child pornography — an extremely stupid move in a legal setting at which your ethics are being called into question (bad jokes are a running theme in this trial). On the, I guess, lighter side (?), the jury also heard from a sex-tape broker, who said that sites use these tapes to boost traffic.
Which brings us to today, the first day Gawker’s lawyers were given a chance to make their case. First up: Daulerio himself.
Wait, I’m sorry: Did you say Bubba the Love Sponge Clem?Yes. Clem, a Florida shock jock and onetime close friend of Hogan’s, is a central figure to the story of the tape. He’s so far refused to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds: In the weeks following the post’s publication, Clem initially said Hogan was aware of being filmed, then settled his suit with Hogan, and then said that Hogan did not know he was being filmed. Either story Clem goes with in court can be contradicted by his own statements, and he could be in further trouble if his answers contradicted statements he gave to the FBI.
In other words, with Clem’s testimony, Gawker might be able to establish that Hogan knew he was being filmed for the tape — undermining Hogan’s lawyers’ claim that the tape counts as “revenge porn.” Gawker has continued to declare that if Clem does not testify, essential aspects of the case will be missing from their argument. “Defendants will be deprived of evidence that is necessary to establish certain facts and is of central importance to their defenses,” lawyers for the site have said.
Where was Daulerio when the actual tape was sent to Gawker’s offices?Daulerio was in Montana, attending a Pearl Jam concert, a fact that is now in the public record.
What else did we learn from today’s testimony?For the most part, all of the defense’s witnesses today — A.J. Daulerio, former managing editor Emma Carmichael, and Nick Denton — were meant to establish that Gawker handled the post’s writing and publication professionally, and that the impetus for the post was news value, not traffic. Daulerio did attempt some damage control, reiterating that earlier comments he’d made in a deposition about publishing a sex tape featuring anyone older than 4 were sarcastic.
Boston Dynamics, certainly the most sinister robot-maker Google owns, has released a horrifying new video of their robot, Atlas — presumably named for the Titan god responsible for holding the world on his shoulders and also the namesake of the best movie trilogy of all time — going outside, running over rough terrain, and getting beaten the hell up by Boston Dynamics geeks with hockey sticks. Yes, some punks are messing around and trying to start the robot revolution with this, a DARPA-funded battle robot now being developed under the benevolent eye of Google X. The robots haven’t begun fighting back — yet. Enjoy your day.
This week in heartwarming Facebook videos that are genuinely touching but also suspiciously oriented around promoting a major brand: a deaf woman, Rebecca King, signing her order at a Starbucks drive­-through in St. Augustine, Florida. Barista Katie Wyble has had a “passion for sign language” since preschool, she tells CBS. The video has 6 million views and counting; if you sign into Facebook, there is an extremely high probability you will see it.
Complicating this sunny picture of feel­-good shareable viral joy is the fact that, two weeks ago, on October 21, Starbucks was sued by a deaf former barista for bias. The barista requested an ASL interpreter; Starbucks didn’t comply, and later fired her under the pretext that her tattoos were visible. Not saying a Starbucks-­commissioned PR agency made sure this very convenient video went big on Facebook, but not not saying that. The best thing about the internet is the way it can tug at your heartstrings and stoke your paranoia in equal measure, at the same time.
Incidentally, Batty’s isn’t the only incept date we can celebrate this year. Pris Stratton, the female replicant (“basic pleasure model”) played by Daryl Hannah, was activated on Valentine’s Day 2016.
It’s January 8, 2016, and a dangerous combat replicant, designation “Roy Batty,” has just been activated. Three years from now, he and three of his fellow humanoid machines — nearly indistinguishable from flesh-and-blood people — will escape and be hunted. Batty will die, and all of his life’s moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.
Batty is, of course, Rutger Hauer’s character in Blade Runner, Ridley Scott’s masterpiece and one of the greatest works of science-fiction cinema ever created. Near the beginning of the film, the camera focuses on a computer screen showing Batty’s vital stats, and we learn his incept date is January 8, 2016. From Scott’s perspective in 1982, today’s date is a far-flung future where L.A. looks like a foreboding Shinjuku, cars fly, and much of humanity has fled the urban dystopia for the safety of “off-world.”
In the 2016 of reality, we’ve seen things the people of 1982 wouldn’t believe: We have Uber labor disputes instead of flying cars; commercial space travel is a dick-measuring contest between billionaires, not accessible to the average human; and L.A.… well, L.A. is kind of a scary dystopia. Gotta give Scott and P.K. Dick that one.
Batty is perhaps best known for the partially improvised monologue that marks his death, the famous “tears in the rain” speech:
Hauer, who perhaps understood his character better than Scott did, explained that he changed the monologue himself to emphasize that Batty simply wanted to “make his mark on existence … the replicant in the final scene, by dying, shows Deckard what a real man is made of.”
More than 30 years after Blade Runner’s release, it’s clear he has made his mark. Dozens, if not hundreds, have wished Batty a “happy incept date” on social media today:
But even if you don’t work somewhere at risk of lawsuits (or, for that matter, subject to freedom-of-information laws), consider that your terrible jokes and idle gossip aren’t prey only for aggressive lawyers. Just ask former Sony Pictures president Amy Pascal. Slack’s security (to name the biggest example) is fairly good. But when you’re creating an enormous searchable database of your workplace conversations, “fairly good” may not be hugely reassuring. You may not even need to be the specific target: All of your Slack data is stored on Slack’s servers, as well as your employer’s. In the unlikely event of a major security breach, the internal chats of many different companies could spill out.
Of course, many media types have spent the last five or six years creating a public record of our gossip and shit-talk on Twitter alongside the private records we’re assembling in Slack or Campfire. The important difference is that my jokes on Twitter are funny. “Tender leg drop” was not. For the record.
I spent part of yesterday afternoon watching a former co-worker explain a joke I’d once made in Campfire, the software we used for work chats. It wasn’t, necessarily, the strangest experience — except that it was occurring in a taped deposition that was being played in court, in the midst of a lawsuit that was being livestreamed on the internet to viewers across the world. My chat joke — and my co-worker John Cook’s noble attempt to explain it to a lawyer — are now a matter of public record.
Gawker Media, the company where I used to work, is being sued by the wrestler Terry Bollea (better known as Hulk Hogan) over a 2012 story in which Gawker published a short excerpt from a video showing Bollea having sex with Heather Clem, the wife of Bollea’s friend Bubba the Love Sponge Clem. (If it isn’t obvious, the trial is taking place in Florida.) I worked at Gawker in 2012, but wasn’t involved in creating the story, so I’m not named in the lawsuit, nor was I deposed as a witness. But I did make jokes that involved Hogan in one way or another in our internal chat at the time. And now the whole world knows how corny I am.
The joke, which was the subject of a rigorous back-and-forth between John and the opposing counsel, went something like this: Someone referred to the Hulk Hogan sex tape as “tender.” I wondered aloud if it also contained a leg drop (a famous pro-wrestling move) — a “tender leg drop.”
I can’t be much more specific than that, because I have no memory of making this joke. “Jokes I made to co-workers in 2012” is not a category I store prominently in my memory palace, though I love those co-workers and assure you that most of my jokes were much better. This is a scary realization: Hulk Hogan’s lawyers have a better sense of many conversations I had in 2012 than I do.
The rise of workplace chat software — Slack, HipChat, Campfire, and even Google Hangouts — has been a boon to many tech and media companies. Lowering the threshold of communication eliminates productivity-costing energy expenditures like “standing up and walking over to someone.” Problems can be dealt with more efficiently, questions can be answered more quickly, and gossip can flow much more freely than ever before.
Which might be fine, if all that gossip wasn’t being archived in a searchable database. We’ve gotten so used to talking with our co-workers over Slack that we tend to forget it has an essential difference compared with in-person conversations: permanence. The ephemerality of face-to-face communication is a feature and a bug. The usefulness of being able to search your conversations with your boss to figure out exactly what he’s asking for turns into a major liability when it also includes you bitching with co-workers about him in a private chat.
I got off lucky in this case because the only unfortunate fact revealed to the world is how annoying I am in workplace chat rooms, something already known to my former co-workers and slowly being learned by my new ones. But there’s a bible’s worth of casual (or joking) shit-talking I’ve done in Gawker’s chat archives, some of which would make me very uncomfortable (if not unemployable) if it got out — a wealth of gossip and prattle I should have just conducted in person.
Lawyers are well aware of this: If you email one, he or she will often respond with a request to get on the phone. If you work at a business that’s at regular risk of lawsuits, you will tend to hear from your lawyers fairly regularly that conversations about sensitive subjects should be had over the phone or, even better, in person. Writing stuff down, incriminating or not, increases the amount of material that can be subpoenaed, and opens up new avenues for your hypothetical opposition. Written correspondence has an unfortunate tendency to lose nuance and irony that can be easily communicated when recalling a conversation for a deposition, as John and I learned in the Hogan deposition process.
Of course, all of this news is just dredging the pepper-spraying up once again. Searching for UC Davis on Google this afternoon will pull up — you guessed it — articles on the internet about UC Davis trying to clean up its online presence. Once again, for the trillionth time, the web eats its own tail, in an endlessly recursive algorithmic nightmare.
An incredibly effective way to get people to talk about something online is to say that you don’t want people to talk about it. This is known as the Streisand Effect, so called after Barbra Streisand, in 2003, tried to get outlets to stop publishing pictures of her house.
The latest very expensive and profoundly funny example of this phenomenon comes from UC Davis, which spent a whopping $175,000 trying to bury posts about the infamous 2011 incident in which a campus police officer pepper-sprayed protesting students. According to the Sacramento Bee, the university was very concerned about the search-engine results that were being served up following the event, as well as social media posts, and so they hired a number of consultants to try and improve the situation.
Here’s one video of the incident:
One consultancy, Nevins & Associates, was paid $90,000 out of the public university’s operating budget.
Another PR firm, IDMLOCO, was paid $82,500 to create a “comprehensive search engine results management strategy.”
Following the Bee’s report yesterday, UC Davis Chancellor Linda Katehi is once again fielding widespread criticism. In a statement, the university said it tried to clean up its online rep out of fairness to all of the UC Davis affiliates who were not pepper-sprayed.
What does it mean???
One user is even going so far as to examine the dust particles used in the game, looking for an anomaly. Excerpt: “First of [sic], those particles are drifting, not gliding down like dust flakes would do. They drift like the spots you might rarely get from time to time in your vision. … Look closely when you pan the camera all particles fall behind at the same time, with the same spacing, thats [sic] because they are all close to you. If there was dust in the end of the room you would see them passing by camera at a slower rate because they are far away. So. Those particles are in your vision.”
Taking it even further, fans are looking outside the game, trying to find cryptic hints in tweets from Konami and from Kojima himself. Revisiting old trailers also shows scenes that weren’t included in the final game.
Fans have even accused the subreddit’s founder, nuclearsnake, of being a spy for Kojima. They were responsible for “the thread which started all this madness.”
Some of these theories are even being borne out. Yesterday, a new patch to the game nullified one of its major plot points.
Is more of the Metal Gear story on its way? If I had to make an educated guess, probably not. But r/NeverBeGameOver demonstrates how nothing can exist in a vacuum anymore. Every software update, every cryptic tweet, every press release is giving fans something new to obsess over. It’s easy to jump to the conclusion that the subreddit’s community is full of Carrie Mathisons, walls covered in printouts and yards of string, trying to find meaning in the meaningless. Really, they’re just fans who care. The Metal Gear Solid franchise is 17 years old. That’s nearly two decades of getting screwed with by Kojima. r/NeverBeGameOver isn’t an insane offshoot. It’s precisely the end result Kojima wanted.
For the past month and a half, I’ve been consistently checking the subreddit r/NeverBeGameOver, a forum where users trade insane theories about the latest Metal Gear Solid game, the Phantom Pain. Since the game’s release just over two months ago, fans have speculated that it is essentially unfinished; that there is more coming and that the game’s creator, Hideo Kojima, is working some sort of long con.
Some necessary context: Hideo Kojima is insane. Like, not actually insane, but it has long been his M.O. to mess with the people playing his games. Most famously, he pulled a switcheroo in Metal Gear Solid 2, marketing the game as starring beloved protagonist Solid Snake, when in reality, the game starred a different character altogether. At a macro level, Metal Gear Solid 2 was arguably a commentary on the very act of playing video games.
When the Phantom Pain was first announced, it was introduced as a new game from a new Swedish game development studio led by Joakim Mogren. This was all revealed to be a ruse to market the game. (“Joakim,” for instance, is an anagram of “Kojima.”) Right from the get-go, the rollout of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain was meant to be tricky, leaving fans questioning what was real and what was a scam.
And here’s where it gets thornier: Earlier this year, reports began to emerge that Kojima and top brass at Konami were at odds over the game. Kojima was spending a lot of Konami’s money, and a lot of development time, working on a blockbuster console game in an era when cheap smartphone games were the new norm. Reports of discord between the creator and the company grew, to the point where it was rumored that Kojima had left the company, where he had worked since the 1980s. Ahead of the game’s release, Kojima’s name was removed from the game’s box art; an unthinkable slight given how close his name and the franchise are linked. In October, The New Yorker reported that Kojima had indeed left the company, though Konami claimed that he was simply on vacation.
Fans are still unsure whether all of this is a prank. Parts of it make sense: Large productions like the Phantom Pain used to be the norm, but are now rare events. It makes sense financially that Konami would want to move into a sector of gaming where the margins are higher. At the same time, a vocal contingent believes that the whispers of Kojima being forced out are yet another meta stunt. Kojima also claimed the Phantom Pain would be his final Metal Gear game, a claim he had also made about previous games in the series.
It doesn’t help that the actual game of the Phantom Pain has clearly been truncated in many ways. The game is divided into two acts, the first containing 30 or so levels, the second containing just 7. A deleted scene on the collector’s edition of the game showed an unfinished level that didn’t make it into the final game. Players rooting through game files have uncovered a title card for a third chapter that doesn’t exist. The simplest theory is that an impatient Konami forced Kojima to cut his losses and ship whatever work had been completed. But many believe otherwise: that despite repeated claims that work on the game is done, Konami and Kojima have unfinished business.
Thus, r/NeverBeGameOver has emerged to collect observations and conspiracy theories that more is in store for the Phantom Pain. No stone has gone unturned. Players are parsing through files, even going so far as to discover an old ROM hidden within. Others are replaying levels multiple times, hoping that it will eventually unlock new stuff. Others are finding tenuous connections to other Metal Gear games, hoping that the similarities are more than just coincidence.
Those playing on their PCs have modded the game in order to delve further. At the start of this video, for example, you can see a character run through an animation that can’t be seen at all when playing through the game normally.
Internet theologians have pondered this paradox since time immemorial: Could there be a reaction GIF so surprising that the only possible reaction to it is the GIF itself? Well, this ginger gentleman’s animated face was the star — the only star — of a new commercial for Australia’s Got Talent, so it seems that question is now settled. Look at him. Be taken aback by his taken-abackness. Be amazed by his amazement.
Without knowing anything about this season of Australia’s Got Talent, it’s probably safe to say that it’s not going to live up to its promotional spot. Could anything? Australia does have talent, yes: It resides with this charismatic, rubber-jawed audience member right here.
The GIF of this footage is something more than a reaction GIF. It’s an overreaction GIF, and it’s sadly destined for ironic usage only. There are a vanishingly few things you could find out about in Slack or through a Gchat message that would warrant its sincere use. Only in marketing is a shock-and-awe face like that considered a proportional response.
This is the ghost pepper of reaction GIFs. Respect it, certainly, but use it sparingly if at all.
Needless to say, this is all complete garbage, lacking in both factual grounding and internal consistency. And there’s a whole lot more of it!
YouTuber “Redsilverj” has discovered via Facebook that San Bernardino County Fire participated in an active-shooter drill on November 30, just days before the shooting. What did they know, and when did they know it? (They may have known that the U.S. hasn’t gone a week in 2015 without a shooting incident that wounded at least four people, but there’s no way this is a coincidence. Open your eyes, people!)
“ExplorerOne” also noticed the Freemason hat and the active-shooter drill, and he’s here to walk you through how the media covered up the truth about San Bernardino by manipulating their viewers and hiding coded messages in their stories. It’s actually a staged “psyop” by President Obama, who plans to use his final year in office to take away your guns. Once you know what to look for, you can’t miss it. This video is 15 minutes long.
We all have our own ways of making sense of senseless tragedy. Some people think and pray, others advocate for legislative changes, and still others look for hidden connections to the New World Order.
Are these truthers serious? Poe’s law, which tells us that internet parodies of extreme views are indistinguishable from the real thing, makes it impossible to tell.
It’s almost worse to think these YouTubers might just be trolling. In that case, they’re profiting by providing fuel for the delusions of conspiracy theorists. Or politically opportunistic conspiracy-theorist allies.
Truther nabob Alex Jones, whose infowars.com website engaged in some wild Sandy Hook trutherism and this week called the San Bernardino shooting “highly suspicious” and “geared to elicit widespread outrage,” had Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on his show on Wednesday.
“Your reputation is amazing,” Trump told Jones. That’s certainly one way of putting it.
After every high-profile mass shooting in the United States, it somehow takes conspiracy-theorist truthers mere hours to determine how the tragic event was a staged hoax, perpetrated by Obama or the Freemasons or the New World Order, and upload their theories to YouTube to awaken the sheeple.
It happened after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, and it’s happening again after Tuesday’s shooting that killed 14 in San Bernardino, California.
Why wait for official sources to go on the record about the shooters’ motives? These guys have already got it figured out.
Do you see that man in the Freemason hat giving an interview to ABC News? An obvious clue, thinks YouTuber “RussianVids.” It’s all part of Obama’s Satanic war on Christmas, as evidenced in the 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger film The Running Man, or something. This video is 36 minutes long.
RussianVids has also discovered that the Eagles of Death Metal, the band caught in the middle of last month’s terrorist attack on Paris, warned us about the California shooting, but we didn’t listen.
“We’re headed to San Bernardino.” It’s so obvious in retrospect. Could Texas be next?
The backlash isn’t all videos and protest raps, either. Attorney Ryan Morrison, who goes by @videogamelawyer on Twitter and works with the eSports community, announced he plans to file a challenge to the Fine Bros. “React” trademark.
“These guys didn’t come up with the idea of filming funny reactions from kids. And they certainly don’t own an entire genre of YouTube videos. It wasn’t their idea, and it’s not theirs to own or police,” he wrote in a blog post.
The Fine Bros. aren’t entirely without their supporters. Popular YouTuber Phillip DeFranco, a.k.a. PhillyD, made a video asking if people thought the Fine backlash was overblown relative to lesser-known scandals about pedophiles and rapists in the YouTube community. (Answer: It’s a false equivalence, because more than one thing can be bad at a time.)
Hank Green, who, with his brother John, forms maybe the only pair of brothers better known on YouTube than the Fines, also urged caution and suggested people might be, er, overreacting to React World.
In a Medium post, he argued that “no one really understands how trademarks work,” and a lot of the anti-Fine comments misunderstand how the law actually works. He went on to say that how aggressively the Fines enforce their trademark on react will depend on their attorneys.
“The question becomes … what are the Fines going to do with their trademark? Certainly they won’t take down every video on YouTube with the word ‘React’ in it,” he wrote.
Morrison, the video-game lawyer, disagrees:
It’s not clear how this will all play out, but it’s clear that what could have been a smart and interesting move — applying a franchise model to a popular YouTube channel — is dying before it can even get started because of the tone-deaf way the Fines presented it to the community whose support they were asking for.
Brothers Benny and Rafi Fine became YouTube stars thanks to their popular videos of kids and teen reacting to things — old technology, TV theme songs, other YouTube videos. Last week the Fine Bros. announced they’d trademarked "react," and they’d allow other channels to make similar videos … as long as they followed some rules about the format and agreed to share revenue with the Fines. The backlash from the YouTube community was swift, and it snowballed over the weekend — Reddit’s r/videos subreddit is now dominated by other YouTubers coming out against the Fine Bros. and their “React World” announcement.
The Fines apparently didn’t realize how controversial their proposal would be, but it turned out that the community did not take kindly to their trademarking words like react and opinion with respect to YouTube videos, and attempting to turn something kinda-sorta creative into a franchise glued together by legal and financial arrangements.
Benny and Rafi released a follow-up video Sunday, addressing the backlash and trying to clarify that React World was supposed to be something nice that would make money for them and other YouTubers, not an excuse to take down anyone’s videos. (Apparently, some videos have already been wrongly taken down by YouTube’s automated Content ID system; the Fines say they’re trying to resolve those claims this week.)
But by the time they released their update, it was already too late. This very funny edit of their not-exactly apology, which was blowing up on Reddit Monday morning, shows what the YouTube community at large thinks of the Fines right now:
And while Redditors were celebrating the Fine Bros.’ plummeting subscription numbers, internet rapper Dan Bull dropped the definitive React World diss track, currently sitting at No. 1 on the charts at reddit’s r/videos. It’s the most concise summary of what’s happened to the Fines over the weekend, and it also rhymes and is catchy.
Apple’s long-running lawsuit over e-book price-fixing has come to a close. In dismissing Apple’s final appeal, the Supreme Court has upheld that the company must pay $450 million in penalties — $400 million to consumers, $20 million to states, and $30 million for legal fees.
The lawsuit surrounded the introduction of Apple’s e-book store in 2010, when it began to attempt to compete with incumbent Amazon. A federal judge, according to Bloomberg, “found that Apple persuaded five of the biggest publishers to shift to a system under which they, and not the retailers, would set book prices. The shift led to a 40 percent increase in the price of e-book best-sellers.”
Apple argues that their entry into the market, and the increase in competition, has caused e-book prices to fall in subsequent years.
“The biker will be scared or alarmed in some way.” Extremely wrong.
I thought I had a pretty good handle on what would happen in “Debris on the path.” — a ten-second tour de force uploaded to YouTube last month. I was wrong.
“It’s debris on the path,” I thought. “Pretty simple stuff. The path is filled with debris.” God, what a fool I was.
Filmed with a GoPro camera, so that we get a first-person view of the action, “Debris” shows what happens when you jump to conclusions too quickly. There are a lot of crazy GoPro videos out there showing extreme athletes performing sick stunts, but I’ve never seen someone maintain courage under fire like this guy.
“The path will have no debris.” Wrong!
“The debris in the path will be logs.” Wrong!
“The debris is actually a crocodile.” Unclear!
“The debris is actually an alligator.” More probable than a croc given that the video was filmed in Florida!
If you search on Google Maps for “microcomputers near dearborn,” you get a spot called Micro Computers at 15417 Warren Avenue. As for the demonstrators, a local news report noted that they gathered at the Karbalaa Islamic Center and then “walked together to nearby Ford Woods Park.” Here are the options for what that route would have looked like, according to Google Maps, given the Karbalaa Islamic Center’s listed address, with the computer shop indicated as well:
Yep, they marched right past it. And if you noodle around on Street View, you can roughly re-create the shot that’s circulating online (click this link to jump there), which was apparently taken on West Warren Avenue, looking east across Greenfield Road.
The relevant Google Maps routes has the protesters coming toward the camera and then hitching a left (or going right, from the photographer’s perspective), crossing Warren, and heading south on Greenfield, which seems to be what’s happening in the original photo.
So, to recap: American Muslims in Dearborn banded together to vocally and visibly protest ISIS, and within a week and a half, parts of the right-wing internet were circulating a photo of this demonstration as proof that American Muslims in Dearborn were openly supporting ISIS.
This is what happens when the conversation about a minority group flies completely off the rails.
Last night, a Facebook correspondent messaged me an alarming note: “Hey Jesse, thought you might be interested in what’s not being reported in the news. This is Dearborn, Michigan, right after the terrorist attack in California. What flags do you see flying here?” The link was to this Facebook post, a photo of what appeared to be a procession of flag-bearing people marching down a street on a gray day, though they’re mostly obscured by cars, so you can’t really tell what’s going on, with scary text reading, "This is Dearborn Michigan after the radical Islamic attack in California ! These are Isis flags and Isis supporters folks but the media has not reported because of politically correctness.” It had been shared almost 3,700 times, and I also found a tweet with the same photo that had been retweeted more than 1,300 times.
I assured the guy who had messaged me that if ISIS were openly demonstrating in Dearborn (which has one of the highest proportions of Arab-Americans in the country and which is therefore a frequent subject of unhinged rumors about Muslims), “the media” would be all over it, and that this was probably false — but that I’d look into it.
A reverse-image search on TinEye quickly revealed that this rumor’s thousands of shares on Facebook and Twitter had caught the attention of the rumor-investigating site Snopes. In a post there, Kim LaCapria concludes that, no, there was not an ISIS demonstration in Dearborn. In fact, based on the timing of the photo and a couple of other nuggets of evidence, she makes a pretty strong — albeit circumstantial — case that if the photo’s real, it’s of an anti-ISIS march that took place in Dearborn on November 27, during which Muslims gathered to raise their collective voices against the terror group.
No way — the fever-swamp internet couldn’t possibly be passing around a photo of an anti-ISIS march as a pro-ISIS march, right? Surely there has to be some boundary point in the national conversation marked with a sign reading “Rumors about Muslims this crazy and fundamentally wrong, even the most terrified and ill-informed Americans won’t believe”?
Alas, if there is a boundary, we haven’t yet found it. Some light web-sleuthing reveals that the photo is, indeed, of an anti-ISIS rally.
For someone unfamiliar with Dearborn, the only real hint as to where the photo was taken is on the right, on a sign affixed to the building with the blue roof. If you look closely, you can make out, just barely, the word microcomputer.
It worked out pretty well. “I just remember maybe six months later,” Parke noted, “looking through Rolling Stone one time and seeing that symbol and I’m like, ‘Wow, that’s pretty impressive.’” After all, could any other artist convince a major music publication to integrate a custom font?
“How many people can just say ‘Hey, I’m changing my name to this symbol so can you use it from now on?’ and everyone’s like ‘Alright. Okay. No questions asked. You’re Prince! We’ll do it!’ It was kind of funny to me.”
The move, catering to emerging technology in media, stands in contrast to Prince’s current reputation as a streaming-skeptical luddite and prolific issuer of takedown notices for his music on YouTube.
“I think he was very forward-thinking,” Parke remembered. “I think what happened a lot of time for him — not to be funny — he had an idea and the truth of the matter is the technology wasn’t quite there for what he wanted.”
Hermes said that Prince, in the early ‘90s, was excited by consumer technology. “I was working there and was kind of the first one to introduce him to bulletin-board systems and very early America Online back then. He was really engaged in all of this. We would spend hours every night. He’d come in and out of the studio and come into our offices just to experiment with graphics and Photoshop and all that software.” Unsurprisingly, Prince was thrilled at the possibility of being able to create art at such a rapid clip.
But there were parts of the computer revolution that were still foreign to him. At least, until they were put in Prince’s own terms. “I was talking about chat groups and chatting and meeting people online and he seemed confused by it,” Hermes reminisced. “Until I had told him I had met a girl. And that’s when he was able to go ‘Oh, I get it! I see where this could be useful.’”
In 1993, Prince frustrated contract lawyers and computer users everywhere when he changed his name to glyph known as “The Love Symbol.” Though he never said so explicitly, it’s generally understood that the name change was attempt to stick it to his record label, Warner Bros., which now had to deal with a top-tier artist with a new, unpronounceable, untypeable name. But it wasn’t just Warner Bros. that had a problem: The Love Symbol proved frustrating for people who wanted to both speak and write about Prince. Writers, editors, and layout designers at magazines and newspapers wouldn’t be able to type the actual name of the Artist Formerly Known As Prince. So Prince did the only thing you could do in that situation: He had a custom-designed font distributed to news outlets on a floppy disk.
Here’s the floppy disk, from the collection of Anil Dash, who’s written about it here:
The Prince font substituted his symbol for what would otherwise be a capital P. In addition, the font was also made available for download on CompuServe. It was accompanied by a stern letter featuring both usage and installation instructions. (Graphix Zone, the company on the letterhead, released an interactive CD-ROM called Prince Interactive that same year.)
The font idea, according to Chuck Hermes, who worked on the Paisley Park graphic-design team, came out of internal frustration. “It just seemed like a logical thing to do,” Hermes told me over the phone today. “Everybody was having a hard time. He didn’t even want us to be calling him Prince in person. Part of it was, there was this glyph, this symbol that we didn’t know how to pronounce, and he wasn’t giving us any clues.”
“So we had to start communicating, we were just writing the symbol freehand,” he said. “It started out as we just did it for ourselves. We needed some way to be efficiently communicating with this name that we couldn’t type on a keyboard.”
Steve Parke, who worked with Prince at the time, helped mail out the floppy disks. “He basically wanted people to start using that for his name in journalism,” Parke recalled, “and — I gotta be honest with you — I was like, ‘huh.’ I just remember when started I looking at those things I was like, ‘Really? I wonder how that’s gonna play out.’”
“When life gives you lemons,” we used to say, “make lemonade.” It is 2016, and cultural and technological advancements have rendered that old saw obsolete. Now it is: “If life gives you a bad neighbor having loud, unbearable sex, make internet #content.” Such a situation befell Uproxx writer Stacey Ritzen this week, and she gamely rose to the occasion, tweeting an audio recording of her neighbor’s shrieking orgasms.
No one really wins here: not the the woman being shamed for indiscreetly enjoying a sexual encounter, nor the one who works from home and had to suffer the unwanted sounds.
Of course, Ritzen’s Uproxx colleagues turned the incident into a post for the site, so someone did ultimately benefit from the miserable incident. Whether writing for the internet or loudly banging a bus driver, we’re all just flawed humans trying to do our best in a mad and confusing world.
Twenty minutes later, the neighbor was still at it, shrieking like an Otamatone on its highest-pitched setting. Or, as The Daily Mail colorfully put it when it picked up this story about someone having sex with (probably) a bus driver in Philadelphia: It sounded like the woman was being murdered.
But Ritzen assured curious parties that’s not what was happening.
And the screaming just went on. And on. And almost an hour later, it started up again. Hand to God:
Ashby is both sharp and sure of her answers, though: She’s now a two-day Jeopardy! champ with total winnings of thirty-six thousand eight hundre-eh-hed dollars. Haters to the left.
Although Laura Ashby may be the most high-profile example of uptalk in Jeopardy! history, she’s far from alone. So far, in fact, that there’s been an entire study on contestants who pitch up the ends of their responses.
William and Mary sociologist Thomas Linneman reviewed 100 episodes of the show in 2012 and noted that “overall, Jeopardy! contestants use uptalk 37 percent of the time.” For men, it seemed to indicate uncertainty — they were more likely to employ it when they were failing on the show. For women, it was the opposite: The better their performance, the more likely they were to use uptalk, as if to apologize for winning the game.
Laura Ashby, a Georgia attorney — and, more importantly, the author of a rock ’n’ roll version of Much Ado About Nothing — dominated the competition on Jeopardy! earlier this month and was invited back for last night’s episode. That’s much to the chagrin of Twitter, which couldn’t handle the “interesting” inflection of Ashby’s voice.
“Where is she from?” people demanded to know. She’s from Georgia. That was established in the interview at the beginning of the show. But it has nothing to do with her distinctive manner of speaking, a pronounced “uptalk,” marked by a rising intonation as she ends her sentences.
Uptalk is most closely associated with the classic ’90s “valley girl” speech pattern, and although people of all genders use it, it’s held against women in particular as a sign of low intelligence or lack of assertiveness — to the point that some say it’s hurting their careers.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You thought Flynn’s testimony would directly implicate Trump or Mike Pence. Publications in this bubble focused way less on the specifics of Flynn’s deal — he hadn’t actually been granted immunity yet — than on how it could lead to Trump’s impeachment. Accordingly, stories about Flynn’s offer got way less play than stories about Trump’s reaction to it, like an Occupy Democrats post that claimed Trump “stormed out” of a signing ceremony because of questions about Flynn.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were telling everyone about the Magnitsky Act. The biggest story for highly Democratic audiences throughout the end of July was the testimony of financier Bill Browder, who discussed his friend Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in prison and who gave his name to the Magnitsky Act, a law meant to punish the Russian officials responsible for his death. Though there was little, if any, actual new information in the testimony, its thoroughness, and its focus on Natalia Veselnitskaya, the lawyer who met with Don Jr. during the campaign hoping to argue for a Magnitsky Act repeal, gave it currency among close followers of the Russia investigation.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You thought Mueller’s probe was just a ploy to take down Trump. Theories on how exactly Mueller might do this varied a little: He might try to get someone on a “process charge,” as argued by radio host Mark Levin; or try to use his buddy-buddy relationship with Comey to plant false testimony. However, there was still hope that he might be taken down: As Liberty Writers pointed out, Lindsey Graham was on patrol against pesky leaks out of Mueller’s grand jury.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You thought the Obama administration were the real criminals. Nunes’s claim of surveillance got more play in this bubble as evidence of Obama’s malfeasance, while a USA Politics Today post highlighted a moment from Comey’s testimony when South Carolina representative Trey Gowdy claimed that Obama officials could face up to ten years in prison for leaking classified information about the Trump transition team to the press.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were well aware of Session’s lack of disclosure about his meeting with Kislyak, which was covered in depth in two Post stories, as well as meetings between Jared Kushner, Michael Flynn, and Kislyak, thanks to a Times piece. But you also knew that Nancy Pelosi had misstated in saying she hadn’t met Kislyak — a major right-wing meme-story — since the top story in this bubble was a Politico piece proving it.
If you only got your news from this bubble: Like the highly Democratic bubble, you were also interested in what this could mean for Trump. As repackaged by The Hill, ABC News’ story about Trump’s supposed directive to Flynn was the most popular story here, along with Comey’s Tweet: “But let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.” It was embarrassingly earnest, but might it also mean that Mueller was onto something?
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were especially excited about the Papadopoulos plea deal, which seemed to show that definite collusion — not just shady business practices — likely took place. You were also incensed by Brexit leader Nigel Farage’s anti-Semitic claim that the “Jewish lobby” should be a larger source of worry for Americans than possible Russian election interference.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were more focused on the big picture. Popular stories in this bubble detailed the ever-increasing threads between Russia and the election, including Senator Mark Warner’s claim that the Senate Intelligence Committee had found evidence that around 1,000 Russian trolls had targeted swing states with fake news in the run-up to the election. A BBC report also claimed that Comey had told members of Congress that the FBI was investigating whether a Russian diplomat in Washington might be a spy, an allegation that had been published in the Steele dossier.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You thought the mounting reports of Trump’s connections to Russia were evidence of nothing more than Democratic propaganda. A viral Rob Schneider tweet castigating Democrats for focusing on Russia to cover up their election losses got picked up by several places, including Breitbart and IJR. He tweeted it the day before news broke about Flynn, but still, it effectively drowned out anything actually happening with the investigation. Also popular was a write-up about WikiLeaks’s latest act, which claimed that accusations of Russian hacking were cover-ups of CIA hacking, as well as the longtime favorite Hillary uranium story.
If you only got your news from this bubble: You were already looking past Comey’s firing, and anticipating his testimony in front of Congress. In a week when big publications with less partisan audiences, like the New York Times, were dominating the news cycle with already-dramatic news stories, there was less need for the injection of excitement that their more partisan cousins traditionally provide. After all, how can you juice up the story of Trump firing Comey?

Name: Eva ChenDay job: Head of fashion partnerships for InstagramUsername: theevachen212Why you should follow: Unlike Instagram, Snapchat isn’t made for inducing jealousy — you’re more likely to see goofy real-life scenes than perfectly arranged portraits. But somehow Eva Chen’s life looks just as cool on Snapchat as it does on Instagram (where she’s the head of fashion partnerships).

Name: Yoyo Cao Day job: Fashion blogger and designer at ExhibitUsername: yoyokulalaWhy you should follow: Fashion designer Yoyo Cao made a name for herself by racking up more than 100,000 followers on Instagram for her perfectly poised and stylish pics.

As co-founder of the popular style blog Bag Snob (later rebranded as Snob Essentials), her snaps often center on her daily look and what she’s up to when she’s not running her crazy-successful business.

So you should probably follow someone who will motivate you to do so.

Name: Taco BellDay job: Purveyor of cheap tacos Username: tacobellWhy you should follow: Big brands on social media tend to be cloying disasters, but Taco Bell manages to thread the needle between “faceless and impersonal” and “disturbingly thirsty.” I guess it helps that they used the account to announce the return of the “Beefy Crunch Burrito,” and who doesn’t like Beefy Crunch Burritos?

Name: Spoon UniversityDay job: College food blogUsername: spoontvWhy you should follow: Spoon TV, the Snapchat account for popular college food site Spoon University, is devoted to what students across the country are putting into their mouths.

Name: Adrian GrenierDay job: ActorUsername: adrianducontraWhy you should follow: Grenier, who you might remember from his work in Entourage or his role as boyfriend/grilled-cheese-maker in The Devil Wears Prada, has been trying to refashion himself into a tech mogul, and, of course, the most important tech-mogul accessory is a good Snapchat account. Grenier, as laid-back as you might imagine, shares much of his everyday life here; highlights include yoga snaps and Grenier reliving the ‘90s, one cassette tape at a time.
Name: Jared LetoDay job: ActorUsername: jaredletoWhy you should follow: We appreciate Jared Leto’s minimalist approach to Snapchat. The actor frequently shares photos of himself covered in drawings that look like he took a selfie and then let a 10-year-old go to town on it. Also, those watery blue eyes look like a Snapchat filter all their own (Snapchat are you listening?).
Name: Heidi MontagDay job: TV personality and designer Username: prattheidiWhy you should follow: Ever wonder what Heidi Montag is up to this side of The Hills? Turns out California is just as sunny as ever, as Montag often points out in her daily snaps. Our personal favorites are the ones where she rides her pink bicycle around while lip-syncing to Britney Spears songs. It’s comforting to think that Heidi Montag’s life is only one click away.
Name: Chris PrattDay job: ActorUsername: chrisprattsnapWhy you should follow: There aren’t many celebrities more tailor-made for Snapchat, the goofiest social network, than Chris Pratt, the goofiest action star. Pratt is a recent, but excellent, addition to the celebrity Snapchat crew, mostly because he’s not trying to do anything but get a stupid laugh out of his followers. (Here’s a litmus test: Pratt recently snapped a car thermometer reading 69 degrees. Did you giggle? Chris Pratt’s Snapchat is for you.)
Name: Bob SagetDay job: ActorUsername: bobsterclawWhy you should follow: As if the Full House reboot wasn’t enough to rocket Saget into 2016, he’s also pretty excellent on Snapchat. Follow him if you’re into Snapchat filters, R-rated dad jokes, and the occasional reference to, well, Danny Tanner’s penis.
Name: Ryan SeacrestDay job: TV and radio hostUsername: ryanseacrestWhy you should follow: Between American Idol, New Year’s Rockin’ Eve, and every single awards show, Ryan Seacrest is already inescapable, so why not surrender your phone to him, too? If you’ve ever wondered to yourself, Which celebrity is Ryan Seacrest hanging out with today?, you should definitely follow him on Snapchat.
Name: Hailee SteinfeldDay job: SingerUsername: haizWhy you should follow: Whether it’s the other members of the Swift squad or cast mates (she recently starred in Pitch Perfect 2), there’s always something — or, more likely, someone — to see in Hailee Steinfeld’s snaps. The 19-year-old actress and singer (she’s the voice behind 2015’s catchiest masturbation anthem, “Love Myself”) is also headed on tour this summer with Meghan Trainor, so we expect lots of concert clips. Maybe too many.
Name: Chrissy TeigenDay job: Model and cookbook authorUsername: chrissyteigenWhy you should follow: Teigen, who just gave birth to daughter Luna with husband John Legend, is a shining example of how celebs can use Twitter well (or, at least, use it a lot). Her Snapchat is no exception to her A-plus social-media game: Expect snaps of her cute mom, her closet, her pups, and dishes from her cookbook, which came out earlier this year.
Name: Jen AtkinDay job: Celebrity hairstylistUsername: jenatkinhairWhy you should follow: If you’ve ever wondered how to get your hair to look just like a Kardashian’s, Jen Atkin is your answer. But since you’re probably not a celebrity (or reality star, or walking brand, or legend on Earth, or whatever Kardashian family members technically are), watching her snaps is the next best thing. Atkin offers styling and product advice — and, of course, celebrity cameos.
Name: Joyce BonelliDay job: Makeup artistUsername: joyce_bonelliWhy you should follow: Yet another one of the makeup artists behind the Kardashian empire (Bonelli also works with plenty of other A-listers, including Nicki Minaj), Joyce Bonelli’s snaps show what days are like when many of your waking hours are spent trailing Kris Jenner with an iPhone in hand.
Name: Mario DedivanovicDay job: Makeup artistUsername: makeupbymarioWhy you should follow: Longtime makeup artist of Kim Kardashian, Mario Dedivanovic knows how to create the perfect glam look and regularly documents them on Snapchat. But his snaps are also surprisingly useful for those of us who aren’t, you know, Kardashians. Watch for product recommendations, tips, and a lot of selfies.
Name: Bella HadidDay job: ModelUsername: babybels777Why you should follow: If you didn’t get enough of Yolanda Foster’s home on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, her daughter Bella’s Snapchat will help satiate you. And if L.A. real estate isn’t enough, you’ll get plenty of selfies, shots of famous friends (she’s pretty tight with Kylie and Kendall), and appearances by her boyfriend, the Weeknd.
Name: Gigi HadidDay job: ModelUsername: itsgigihadidWhy you should follow: And, because one Hadid is never enough, you should also follow Bella’s older and slightly more famous sister Gigi, the model. When she’s not snapping family (the Kardashians or her own), she’s been known to share a few shots of a One Directioner or two.
Name: Kylie JennerDay job: Model and lip-kit peddlerUsername: kylizzlmynizzlWhy you should follow: The youngest member of House Kardashian-Jenner, Kylie Jenner uses her Snapchat to expand her family’s hold on all media. If Keeping Up With the Kardashians requires too much of your attention (or if you can’t get enough), this is the account for you. Expect a lot of pouty faces, whispering into the camera, and envy-inducing backdrops of gorgeous scenery.
Name: Khloé Kardashian Day job: Being a KardashianUsername: khloekardashianWhy you should follow: Khloé just joined Snapchat, which in most cases would mean we wouldn’t recommend her. But, well, she’s a Kardashian, which means you can trust her Snapchat to be consistently engaging: Lately, she’s been snapping herself with her ex, basketball player Lamar Odom, only to announce to her Snapchat followers that they’re not back together. Who needs TMZ?
Name: Kim Kardashian WestDay job: Internet breakerUsername: kimkardashianWhy you should follow: You’re either already following her, planning on doing so soon, or are entirely refusing to do so. Honestly, what could we even say that would change your mind?
Name: Rob Kardashian Day job: Fiancé of Blac ChynaUsername: robphuckedmeWhy you should follow: Much like the other members of the Kardashian-Jenner family, Rob’s snaps are an unscripted look at what life is like as a member of the First Family of Reality Television. Or as close to unscripted as you can get. In case you don’t, you know, keep up with the Kardashians, here’s what you’ll need to know before watching his snaps. Rob is engaged to Blac Chyna. Blac Chyna is also the ex-girlfriend of Kylie Jenner’s on-again/off-again boyfriend Tyga, and the two women notoriously don’t get along.
Name: Patrick TaDay job: Makeup artistUsername: patrickttaWhy you should follow: If you’re not hanging out with Gigi Hadid but wish you were, you should follow Patrick Ta on Snapchat. If you are hanging out with Gigi Hadid, you probably are already in some of Patrick Ta’s snaps. The celeb makeup artist regularly posts from sessions with Hadid, the Kardashian clan, and Shay Mitchell, to name just a few.
Name: TygaDay job: RapperUsername: lamboluxuryWhy you should follow: If you’re not getting enough Kylie from Kylie’s own Snapchat, go to the next best source: her boyfriend’s. Tyga goes by lamboluxury on Snapchat, and that is about all you need to know; when he’s not snapping Kylie, you’ll get cars.
Name: A-TrakDay job: DJUsername: atrakWhy you should follow: A-Trak’s snap game offers a little bit of everything: selfies, pictures of what he’s eating, snippets from hanging out with his parents, updates from the hair salon (he recently bleached his whole head and snapped the process), and, of course, plenty of concert content.
Name: Justin Bieber Day job: Singer, rapper, Canadian troublemakerUsername: rickthesizzlerWhy you should follow: Justin Bieber is the kind of celebrity you follow not because you want to, but because you have to — after all, don’t you want a front-row seat to the next stupid and controversial thing he does? Which should happen in approximately five minutes.
Name: Chance the RapperDay job: RapperUsername: theacidrapperWhy you should follow: Chance the Rapper (or “Chance the Snapper,” as he’s known on the app) uses Snapchat to keep his fans wanting more. While he hasn’t released an album since Acid Rap in 2013, he’s been known to drop clips of his new music on Snapchat.
Name: DiploDay job: DJ Username: diploWhy you should follow: If you’re watching one of Diplo’s snaps, be prepared to adjust your volume: The DJ frequently snaps from his concerts, which means bass-heavy jams and screaming crowds. But, maybe more important, he also snaps his kids a lot — and they’re very cute.
Name: Ariana GrandeDay job: SingerUsername: moonlightbaeWhy you should follow: She sings. She dances. She licks doughnuts. She does a mean Celine Dion impersonation. And sometimes she even does these things on Snapchat.
Name: Rick RossDay job: RapperUsername: ferrarifatboyWhy you should follow: One part LOL and one part NSFW (okay, maybe a few parts NSFW), Rick Ross’s Snapchat is full of delightful surprises, like the time he showed off matching ankle monitors with Meek Mill.
Name: Meghan TrainorDay job: Singer Username: mtrainor22Why you should follow: It’s not hugely surprising that Meghan Trainor is an avid Snapchatter, since she is, after all, 22. What’s maybe a little surprising is that her Snapchat account is good: Watch her snaps to get a glimpse into what goes on inside the recording studio.
Name: ZendayaDay job: Singer and very cool teenUsername: zendaya_96Why you should follow: The 19-year-old Disney star turned activist (and member of Taylor Swift’s squad) pairs glam snaps with more everyday fare, like Zendaya driving around town. Or, rather, Zendaya snapping from the passenger’s seat as her mother drives her around town.
Name: Shaun AyalaDay job: Marketing managerUsername: shaunayalaWhy you should follow: Ayala’s whole career is built around Snapchat. That’s how good he is. He treats his snaps not just as photos or videos but as interactive games (followers can snap him back to play), with characters like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong. And don’t be surprised to see appearances from other Snapchat stars in Ayala’s weekly stories.
Name: Tristan de BurghDay job: Snapchat influencerUsername: tristantalesWhy you should follow: If you’re looking for a quick dose of daily comedy, Tristan de Burgh’s your guy. His snaps usually tell some kind of outlandish story, like his recent safari through a Whole Foods. It, uh, definitely doesn’t hurt that he’s not terrible to look at.
Name: Danny BerkDay job: Snapchat influencer and semi-pro surgerUsername: dannyberkWhy you should follow: A relative new kid on the Snapchat block, Danny Berk is poised to be the next big thing in ten seconds or less. (He was nominated for a Shorty Award for Snapchatter of the Year in 2016.) A semi-pro surfer, add him on Snapchat to see what your life would look like if your life involved going to the beach a lot more than it probably does.
Name: CJDay job: Flight student and baristaUsername: operamericanoWhy you should follow: OperAmericano’s identity is a secret, but that hasn’t stopped her from racking up tons of fans on Snapchat. A big part of her appeal is a series she created called “What’s That Tune Tuesday,” where OperAmericano will sing a snippet of a song and fans will send her snaps back to guess what she’s singing. As with many of her fellow Snapchatters, she’s also a way better doodler than you are.
Name: Brittany Furlan Day job: Vine starUsername: brittanyjfurlanWhy you should follow: Brittany Furlan is one of the top female Vine stars; millions of fans follow her on the video app to watch her six-second clips. So you can imagine that her Snapchat stories are similarly beloved. And, well, she’s actually funny, even to grown-ups: Her comedic timing is spot-on. (Plus, if you’re a fan of all of those cute Vine star boys, you’re in luck — they tend to show up.)
Name: Sara HopkinsDay job: Vine star and social influencerUsername: sayhopWhy you should follow: Hopkins, a Vine star, is one of the new generation of comedians whose short videos occupy the universe of “relatable” humor — what older stand-ups might’ve called “observational” humor. Ever gone to Target to get just one thing and ended up with six? Hopkins has a snap for you. She also has an excellent dog, Chico.
Name: Mark KayeDay job: Radio hostUsername: markkayeWhy you should follow: This Florida radio personality hosts an all-Snapchat show called Talking’ Snap! where he interviews celebrities and other Snapchatters. He calls himself “the Jimmy Fallon of Snapchat.” We’re not sure we’d go that far, but he did interview Kevin Jonas once. Plus, who else would the Jimmy Fallon of Snapchat be?
Name: Taylor NikolaiDay job: Social-media influencerUsername: taylor.nikolaiWhy you should follow: If you like nice, clean corny dad jokes, Taylor Nikolai will give you (at least) one a day. You used to need to eat a whole Popsicle to get a good corny joke; now you can just check Nikolai’s stories.

Name: Kate McCullyDay job: Travel blogger at Adventurous KateUsername: adventurouskateWhy you should follow: After building a name for herself as a solo female travel blogger, McCully has settled down in Manhattan. She hasn’t stopped having adventures, though — they’re just a little smaller-scale. Watch as she wanders New York City doing all the things you’ve wanted to do but have never gotten around to doing. Read: eat one of those stupid rainbow bagels.
Name: Kiersten RichDay job: Travel blogger at the Blonde AbroadUsername: theblondeabroadWhy you should follow: This is the Snapchat arm of Kiersten Rich’s popular travel blog, the Blonde Abroad. Watch as Rich eats, swims, and selfies her way across the globe. She’s visited more than 50 countries and is currently snapping (and drinking a lot of wine) from South Africa.
Name: Justin KanDay job: Partner at Y CombinatorUsername: justinkanWhy you should follow: Like many entrepreneurs, Justin Kan, a partner at Y Combinator, holds Q&A sessions and offers professional guidance to aspiring investors. It’s just that instead of limiting his mentorship sessions to colleagues, he does it all over Snapchat. He recently hired a “Snap God” to help him grow his presence on the app, so we’re expecting big things.
Name: Mark SusterDay job: Partner at Upfront VenturesUsername: msusterWhy you should follow: Thousands of venture capitalists, investors, engineers, and techies tune in every day to see what venture capitalist Mark Suster is up to on Snapchat. Suster’s daily stories, which he calls “SnapStorms,” provide real-time advice for anyone looking to change the world, make a mint off the tech industry, or both.
Name: Hunter WalkDay job: Partner at Homebrew Username: hunterwalkWhy you should follow: Walk is another of Snapchat’s most exotic species: the venture-capitalist user, who picks up the app to see what’s occupying people on their phones. Follow him to see what a typical business day looks like; expect, also, jokes (see this blog entry he wrote about how Amazon Echo is turning his kid into an “asshole”).
Name: Gary VaynerchukDay job: CEO of VaynerMediaUsername: garyveeWhy you should follow: Gary Vaynerchuk is an aggressive Snapchat user: There seem to be very few moments in his day that the venture capitalist, and host of YouTube’s #AskGaryVee Show, doesn’t share on Snapchat. But if you can handle it, you’re rewarded with substantial discussions of business tactics, and, also, somebody who can shove a banana into his mouth at record speed.
Name: Branden Harvey Day job: Travel photographerUsername: brandenharveyWhy you should follow: Harvey calls Nashville home, but don’t expect to see a lot of Tennessee snaps: The photographer (who first gained thousands of fans on Instagram before joining Snapchat) snaps from wherever he is — on a train to nearby states, or jet-setting around the globe. Come for the wanderlust, stay for Harvey’s insane hairstyle.
Name: Evan GarberDay job: Snapchat influencerUsername: emgarberWhy you should follow: Garber, a former mechanical engineer, became a full-time Snapchatter after getting laid off from his job in 2014. His intricately drawn Snapchats make him one of the service’s most in-demand artists, but his elaborate projects are what make him worth following — like this excellent live re-creation of the classic N64 game Goldeneye, done in collaboration with Shaun McBride.
Name: Frankie GreekDay job: Social-media managerUsername: wtfrankieWhy you should follow: A self-described “problem child” and “internet human,” it seems Frankie Greek lives her whole life online. Her day job as a social-media manager in New York City means Greek is rarely without her phone, so expect to see daily snaps as Greek updates her followers on what she’s up to, whether that’s visiting friends in Los Angeles or giving live updates from her morning subway ride. With a head of hot-pink hair, she’s hard to miss.
Name: Sallia GoldsteinDay job: EngineerUsername: salliasnapWhy you should follow: Who says social media can’t be educational? (Try to read that without rolling your eyes.) A full-time engineer and part-time Snapchat pro, Goldstein has an account devoted to all things science; every Monday she hosts a weekly show where she demonstrates experiments, like building a Rube Goldberg machine. Doesn’t hurt that she’s also one heck of an artist.
Emoji don’t appear out of nowhere. They’re managed by a governing body of the internet known as the Unicode Consortium, which sets encoding standards for characters so that they appear mostly consistent across computers. For the most part, they’ve operated in relative anonymity and out of the spotlight.
That is, until emoji came along. According to internal emails reviewed by BuzzFeed, the consortium’s new rock-star status as the emoji gatekeepers has caused dramatic infighting among the normally staid group. Specifically, famed typographer Michael Everson is angry that the group has chosen to focus on the tiny pictograms. “Emoji, emoji, emoji. It’s all about emoji,” he wrote.
In the meantime, Everson has been waiting for the consortium to approve some of his submissions, making them standard on mainstream consumer devices, for years. “I’m editing some documents in medieval Cornish, and I personally need some of these characters. Their absence is impeding my work,” he told BuzzFeed. (Medieval Cornish! We’ve all been there!)
Other members chimed in with their frustrations, one writing, “I was angered that an organization that essentially dedicates itself to the standardization of encoding the world’s languages has been dumbed down to the organization that ‘makes emoji.’”
They have a point. Emoji, while incredibly popular, are just one part of the consortium’s mission. Other primary goals include ensuring that all languages are equally accessible via computer — the consortium’s president described them as “digitally disadvantaged languages.”
To that end, emoji have given the consortium members a greater standing, resulting in more contributions. Now they just need to not let it go to their heads.
Name: Audrey SpencerDay job: Industrial designerUsername: cakes1todough1Why you should follow: Taylor Swift has some competition for the title of “Best Cat Lady on Social Media.” Audrey Spencer’s feline-inspired snaps prominently feature her cats, both as they exist in real life and how they look when hilariously doodled into pole dancers or pirates. Did we mention cats? So. Many. Cats.
Name: Dr. Michael SalzhauerDay job: Plastic SurgeonUsername: therealdrmiamiWhy you should follow: If you’ve ever considered getting plastic surgery, or are still watching reruns of Nip/Tuck, this NSFW and slightly gory account is for you. Dr. Miami (who is, yes, a real, board-certified plastic surgeon) takes you behind the scenes as he slices and tucks everything from tummies to bums to love handles.
Name: Dr. Sandra LeeDay job: Dermatologist Username: drpimplepopperWhy you should follow: The fact that Dr. Sandra Lee’s snap handle is “Dr. Pimple Popper” says just about everything you need to know. Watch as Lee, a dermatologist with followings on Instagram and YouTube, splices and squeezes goop out of people’s skin. It’s incredibly disgusting and, yet, insanely compelling. (Read more about Dr. Lee here.)
Name: Vashtie KolaDay job: Model, artist, and DJ Username: vashtiekolaWhy you should follow: Vashtie Kola is something of a chameleon. The New York–based artist has done everything from designing shoes for Nike to directing a music video for Justin Bieber. Expect a range of content, from what she’s eating for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon to where she’s rocking out on a Saturday night. Weirdly, it’s the more everyday snaps that are our favorites.
Snapchat has more than 100 million users. But how are you supposed to find any of them?
Name: DJ KhaledDay job: DJUsername: djkhaled305Why you should follow: There’s a reason DJ Khaled’s name feels like it’s been in every headline about Snapchat for the past six months: The guy is good. From daily lessons about life and musings while he waters his plants to that time he infamously got lost on a Jet Ski, Khaled’s life is Snapchat gold. We just wish he’d stop snapping from the shower. We’re worried about water damage.
Name: Cyrene QuiamcoDay job: Snapchat influencerUsername: cyreneqWhy you should follow: If Kylie Jenner is the king of Snapchat (It’s the 21st century! Women can be kings!), then Cyrene Quiamco is its queen. Earlier this year, the 26-year-old quit her full-time job as a web designer with Verizon; now she pays the bills solely with her colorful doodled snaps, for which brands pay her thousands of dollars. Her “celebrity selfies,” a series where Quiamco draws herself beside stars like Bruno Mars and Ellen DeGeneres, is a fan favorite.
Name: Georgio Bassil Day job: Pursuing a master’s degree in interior architectureUsername: georgio.copterWhy you should follow: Georgio Bassil whimsically transforms photos and videos from his everyday life by adding six-eyed, three-horned monsters. At their best, his snaps are almost like miniature Monsters Inc. sequels — in other words, great.
Name: Arnold Schwarzenegger Day job: Actor, Terminator, and former governor of CaliforniaUsername: arnoldschnitzelWhy you should follow: Most 68-year-olds don’t even know what Snapchat is, much less how to use it and use it well. But most 68-year-olds have never played Conan the Barbarian, either. Late in life, Arnold Schwarzenegger has become a social-media savant with a deep understanding of what makes for good snaps: a peek behind the scenes of the actor turned politician turned actor’s day-to-day life with some well-placed emoji. Follow for world travel, a look behind the scenes of current projects and, not surprisingly, a lot of gym selfies.
Name: Kym PerfettoDay job: SoulCycle InstructorUsername: kymnonstopWhy you should follow: A SoulCycle master instructor (way better than your regular, boring, normal instructor), former Amazing Race competitor, and generally athletic human, Kym Perfetto finds there are few hours throughout the day where she isn’t moving. Watch as she snaps while bopping from spin class to the gym to another spin class. Why would you pay for a SoulCycle membership when you can just open up Snapchat and pretend?
Name: Yvan Rodic Day job: Style photographer and creator of FaceHunterUsername: mrfhWhy you should follow: Yvan Rodic — a.k.a. FaceHunter — is one of the web’s best-known street-style photographers. He once told Vogue that to take a great photograph, “you need a great character with a good spirit.” (You also need a big travel budget, but luckily Rodic has that.)
Name: Julieanna GoddardDay job: Blogger and promoter at “Yez Julz!” Username: yesjulz Why you should follow: Consider Julz Goddard’s Snapchat your all-access pass to the parties and clubs you wish you were hanging out at instead of sitting on your couch. The self-proclaimed “director of vibes” hails from Miami and dreams of “bridging the gap between cool & conscious.” Whatever that means. Follow her because her life is way more chill than yours.
Name: Kate HudsonDay job: Actress and fitnesswear enthusiastUsername: khudsnapsWhy you should follow: Love Kate Hudson? You should follow her on Snapchat. Hate Kate Hudson? You should follow her on Snapchat. Unlike a lot of celebs who come and go on the app, the actress has really committed to using the app regularly (maybe too regularly), so there’s always something new to see. Recent highlights include a step-by-step video of Hudson cooking huevos rancheros, sped up so her voice sounded like something out of Alvin and the Chipmunks. Very hard-hitting stuff.
Name: Paris HiltonDay job: HeiressUsername: realparishiltonWhy you should follow: 2003’s favorite hotel heiress has found a room of her own on Snapchat, where she often documents her adventures as a club DJ. Peak Paris snaps feature Hilton singing along to her 2006 hit “Stars Are Blind.” (Okay, we considered it a hit.)
Name: Shaun McBrideDay job: Snapchat influencer and vloggerUsername: shondurasWhy you should follow: Better known online as “Shonduras,” Shaun McBride was among the first people to get a big Snapchat following (and, consequently, big brand partnerships). You wouldn’t think watching somebody install a cereal dispenser would be entertaining, but when McBride does it, you can’t help but wish you’d thought of it first.
Name: Los Angeles County Museum of ArtDay job: MuseumUsername: lacmaWhy you should follow: One Drake lyric at a time, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is determined to get Snapchat addicts interested in art. The museum likes to use lyrics from popular music paired with shots of artwork from its collection, like a painting of coconuts paired with the caption “I’m in love with the coco.” You get the idea.
Name: RihannaDay job: Singer, designer, being RihannaUsername: rihannaWhy you should follow: What’s there to say that hasn’t already been said? While lots of celebs have huge Snapchat followings just because they’re famous, Rihanna is among a dozen or so who really, truly understand what it means to be good at Snapchat. “Rihanna’s Snapchat is a flurry of real-life gems in which she floats through life, often hilariously, like a goddess,” wrote Myles Tanzer for Vogue.
Name: Christine MiDay job: Snapchat artist and strategistUsername: miologieWhy you should follow: After graduating from Yale in 2015, Christine Mi decided to forgo the traditional career route and instead go all-in on Snapchat. And why not? She has a zany, colorful account filled with incredibly detailed drawings of classic art pieces — with Christine’s face wedged in the middle.
Welcome to Select All, a new site devoted to technology from New York Media.
Some highlights from the last few months: how Facebook got cool and weird again; Twitter’s growing harassment problem; the the rise of Instagram as a blogging platform; the meaning of vulgar tweets sent to celebrities; the rabbit holes of online conspiracy theory; the return of the command line; the “halpert”; the life and death of “LOL”; the rise of bots. And, of course, deep dives into important memes present (“Damn, Daniel”) and past (the classic, mysterious “Back at It Again, Krispy Kreme”).
We’re excited to get started. Or, at least, continue. You can like us on Facebook here, follow us on Twitter here, and email me at max.read@nymag.com.
We might look familiar. For the last few months, we’ve been running, under the name “Following,” as a sort of public beta of a tech blog — one focused less on gadget specs and stock prices than on technology as lived experience. Throughout that stealth-mode run, we’ve been guided by a fascination with the weird and wonderful ways in which people live online — the cultures, communities, behaviors, ideas, and jokes that have arisen as the internet, the smartphone, and the on-demand economy have become essential components of contemporary life. To this end, we’ve always kept the human experience at the core of our coverage, asking both what tech can do for us and what it can do to us.
But now we’re going legit. Select All will continue to report on the weird and wonderful ways people express themselves on the internet and social media. But we’ll also be widening our focus to include very personal recommendations for cutting-edge gadgets, the roller-coaster careers of the tastemakers of social media, and the ways in which the titans of Silicon Valley affect all of our lives. We’ll make use of a variety of formats: You can expect explainers, buying guides, reported features, critical arguments, personal essays, blog posts, and, yes, lists. There’ll be some video and some interactive packages, too. And above all we’ll carry over from Following our enthusiasm, curiosity, and sense of humor about the human relationship to technology.
After Mark Zuckerberg publicly denounced Donald Trump (not by name, for some reason, but very clearly), Gizmodo reported that Facebook employees asked on an internal message board whether Facebook has a responsibility to try to stop a Trump presidency. The question, verbatim, was: “What responsibility does Facebook have to help prevent President Trump in 2017?”
Facebook also has access to huge amounts of microtargeting data; that’s exactly what makes the company so valuable to advertisers, and it’s no different for politics. “There’s lots of opportunity, I think, to manipulate based on what they know about people,” says Josh Wright, executive director of Ideas42, a nonprofit lab that uses behavioral science for social good.
“The way that you present information on Facebook or other social-media sites can have subtle but meaningful effects on people’s moods, their attitudes,” says Paul Brewer, a professor in the communications department of the University of Delaware who has studied Facebook’s political effects. Facebook knows this better than anyone; a study, released in 2014, was conducted to see whether changing the emotional content of users’ News Feeds would affect their mood. (The answer: yes.)
Zuckerberg didn’t answer — publicly, at least. But there was a larger, and frankly scarier, question lurking behind the question of Facebook’s political responsibilities: Could Facebook help prevent President Trump? Not through lobbying or donations or political action committees, but simply by exploiting the enormous reach and power of its core products? Could Facebook, a private corporation with over a billion active users, swing an election just by adjusting its News Feed?
The first thing Facebook would have to do, if it wanted to swing an election, would be to suss out exactly who to target. “In politics, on some things, it’s very hard to change people’s minds,” says Brewer. “You’re not gonna change people from a Trump supporter to a Bernie supporter.” Trying to change the minds of those who are already vocally committed to one candidate is, basically, not worth the effort. So Facebook would, like any campaign, want to encourage turnout among the supporters of its preferred candidate, persuade the small number of genuinely uncommitted likely voters, and target apathetic voters who could be convinced to get out to the polls.
Assuming Facebook has successfully identified a persuadable voter, the next step would be the persuasion. Some of the tactics are basically the same as any other form of advertising. Most obviously, Facebook would be wise, says Brewer, to continually show pro-Facebook-candidate stories and ads, varying them so as not to annoy the user with repetition. Familiarity bias, a psychological phenomenon that finds that we make decisions in favor of things we see often, would come into play here. Hammering away with a picture of a candidate would have the same effect as a movie with billboards every other mile.
Facebook, understandably, keeps close to its chest exactly what conclusions it can draw about users based on their behavior on the social network. But the company almost certainly has the data to determine what your politics are; it has itself trumpeted the correlations between “liked” Facebook pages and political affiliation. It’s unclear whether apathy, as such, would be as easy to identify, but if you consider that third-party researchers have used public Facebook data to create algorithms that can predict personality traits to a high degree of accuracy, it seems likely that it would be fairly easy for the company to deduce your level of political engagement.
More directly, Facebook could build algorithms that would curate your News Feed based on particular “wedge issues” that it can tell you care about. If your Facebook data explicitly or implicitly identifies you as a Republican, but some posting history explicitly or implicitly shows you support immigration amnesty, Facebook could ensure that articles and comments about each candidate’s stance on immigration are more likely to appear in your feed.
But both Wright and Brewer noted that the biggest potential for Facebook is not in its abilities as an advertiser but in its control over your social worldview. Brewer conducted a study in which he and his team presented real Facebook users with a fake political candidate, shown in news stories in the News Feed. Those stories were sometimes accompanied by (fake) comments — some positive, some negative.
The study found that what the candidate said didn’t much matter to the subjects; what mattered were the comments. “What you say about yourself, including on social media, isn’t as persuasive as what other people say about you,” says Brewer. “We know that people are motivated to present themselves in the best possible light.” This is why Amazon and Yelp reviews are so important: We trust other people more than we trust the subject.
Wright mentioned in-group and out-group psychological theories of social identity: These say, basically, that we tend to identify and to like people who are like us. For example, Facebook knows that you like, say, basketball. It could then ensure that of the thousands of stories, photographs, and videos of its preferred candidate being posted in your extended network, you’re most likely to see the content that shows the candidate playing or somehow involved with basketball. It’d be a simple but effective way to engender positive feelings.
Facebook’s data about you could also come in handy for figuring out when to blast you with ads. “We as humans have limited attention, limited cognitive bandwidth, and we just can’t read everything that comes through Facebook,” says Wright. The metrics for attention are incredibly valuable here: Facebook can figure out when in the day you’re most likely to click through to other stories, to read long posts, or to interact with other users. That changes for everyone; a single parent should be targeted at a different time than someone who works nights or someone still in school or someone unemployed. TV ads can’t figure that stuff out, but Facebook can.
Browsing through Facebook gives you a feeling of consensus that’s totally decided by your particular selection of friends. Studies have indicated that most Facebook users have a strikingly homogeneous circle of friends, in terms of taste and political beliefs and even geography. Your News Feed now, even without any of the sci-fi manipulation stuff, tends toward an echo chamber. Facebook’s algorithm is already set up to display things to you that it thinks you already like. There’s nothing outright sinister about that; Facebook simply wants to give you things it thinks you’ll like in order to increase your time on the site and your engagement, and it uses the data about things you’ve liked in the past to do that. “Already Facebook is more likely to cause people to reinforce ideology,” says Wright.
So the most valuable thing Facebook has to offer is, well, us. Nowhere is this more true than in getting out the vote — the most important, and most difficult, task in any political campaign, and one at which Facebook has already demonstrated some success. As political polarization increases, there are fewer truly persuadable voters; to a large extent, candidates and parties win based on their ability to get their supporters out to vote. And studies have indicated that Facebook legitimately has the power to move people to the polls: One study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, during the 2010 midterm election found that those users presented with photographs of friends along with a message about voting were 0.39 percent more likely to actually go vote than those who saw just the message. It’s a seemingly small effect that would compound across a large population: The study’s researchers found that for every person directly mobilized by the images of friends, an additional four voters were yielded thanks to the “social contagion” effect of Facebook’s friend networks. Imagine if those photographs were only shown to supporters of one party.
I asked about bots, or fake comments, and both Wright and Brewer suggested that this would be effective, but probably not as effective. “All else being equal, friends are more persuasive,” says Wright. But what about those friends we all have who we totally disagree with, I asked. “There would be exceptions that would hurt you, but playing the law of averages, you’d win,” says Brewer.
Perhaps the scariest part about this exploration into the possible is that there are all kinds of questions that we can’t answer, but that Facebook probably can. I asked whether adjacent posts make a difference. For example, would Facebook want to bookend a political post with something fluffy and positive, or something outraging that’ll get your blood boiling? Neither Wright nor Brewer knew, but we all know who could find out: Facebook. Little stuff, like whether a font or a color matters, whether a picture size matters, how long an ideal post should be, and all of the other tiny variables that make up a News Feed — those might make a difference, or they might not, but the only entity with the data and the manpower to figure it all out is, well, Facebook.
The comments, far from being useless chatter, are tremendously powerful. Facebook could very easily surface positive comments about its preferred candidate and bury negative ones. Wright even suggested Facebook might want to bury long back-and-forth debates; those imply that there’s something negative being said, and you’d also have the struggle of trying to make people actually read something long and involved.
The problem is that it’s hard to figure out where they are. The Snapchat Discovery tab leads you only to carefully curated content from news organizations, and the app is generally (and maybe intentionally) not as intuitive as some of its rival social platforms. It’s easy to give up and just delete it from your phone. But Snapchat is used by tons of weird, interesting, creative people, all of whom are creating fascinating new things for increasingly large audiences.
So: How do you find those accounts? Which are the ones worth adding to your roster of friends? And once you figure all of that out, how do you follow them?
Part of Snapchat’s beauty is that it’s not aggressively public. You can snap photos privately to one person or several people at a time. Your photos, unless your friends screenshot them before they disappear, fade away after a few seconds.
As on many social networks, the best Snapchat users have something that you might not — a talent for drawing, a gift for short skits, a closet full of Prada, the major keys to life — but, just as important, they have a willingness to show it off in a funny, engaging, and down-to-earth way. The culture of Snapchat is more outgoing and less “filtered” than Instagram; you come to it for personality and presence rather than perfect curation. Users share less-buttoned-up versions of themselves, and act in the moment, without doing a ton of editing (or thinking) prior to publishing. They talk at the camera in a way that makes you feel like you could be sitting in the same room, or show off cool stuff — drawings, dishes, bags — with immediate glee rather than filtered distance.
But you don’t just have to follow — or share photos with — only your friends. You can sequence snaps to create a public story, a kind of flipbook that anyone following you on the app can access as many times as they want in a 24-hour period. It’s those stories where some of the funniest, weird, coolest, and most interesting stuff on Snapchat exists.
Look no further. We’ve assembled this list of 101 artists, musicians, celebrities, chefs, models, trainers, and dogs we believe are worth your follow. Yes, DJ Khaled is there, along with a handful of other people you’ll recognize (though their Snapchats might show a side of their lives you didn’t realize existed). But many, we hope, will be brand-new names (ever heard of Julz Goddard or Audrey Spencer?) you’ll be happy we introduced you to. They’ll show you everything from the Miami club scene to cat videos. All 101 have found a home on the app where they can be funny, or weird, or cute, or just flat-out creative. They’re all, to put it bluntly, really good at Snapchat.
With each profile on this list, there’s a corresponding yellow box containing a ghost. This is a Snapcode, a user-specific QR code that you can use to add people on Snapchat. (There are a few other ways to do this, but this method is definitely the easiest.)
To add a person, whip out your phone, open the app, and take a picture of your Snapcode of choice. You’ll see a pop-up notification where you’ll need to tap “Add Friend” to confirm. Or you can swipe down from the Snapchat home screen, tap “Add Friends,” and manually type in their username.
To help make sense of what is, we admit, a very long list, we’ll kick it off with a Top Ten — the ten you should follow now.
Ah, the selfie stick. The greatest technological innovation of the 21st century beside the U2-branded iPod.
Yes, the man is probably using the stick to press the shutter button on a camera which is positioned on a tripod. But it’s still a selfie by any reasonable definition. And, yes, he’s using a stick. Hence: selfie stick.
Or is it?
“1934 Selfie, with a stick,” reads the caption to a photo uploaded to Imgur on Wednesday. In just three hours, more than 200,000 people have already viewed it and it’s quickly rising on the Reddit front page.
(At least one selfie truther in the Select All offices believes the stick is being used to poke a human photographer at the moment of capture. We’ll continue to pursue the inquiry.)
Unskippable ads,Coming to YouTube in Spring,Like poems, says Google.
It’s like reading Bashō, no?
Qz is reporting that, starting in May, before you watch your YouTube video of choice (Justin Bieber’s “Sorry” for the 125th time), you might see a five-second ad, or “bumper ad.” That you can’t skip. The idea is to create ads specifically targeting young people who mostly watch video on mobile.
But don’t worry, Google (YouTube’s parent) explained in a blog post on Tuesday, these ads aren’t designed to bug the viewer. Instead, the company wants you to think of them as “little haikus of video ads.” (If there’s one thing young people love, it’s poetry.)
Here’s an example. Try and tell me you don’t want to buy an Audi after watching this poetry in motion. Just try.
The ads will be primarily targeted at mobile users, since that is where “snackable videos,” i.e. a five-second bumper ad, perform best, the company also explained. Snacks and haiku both: Is nothing sacred to Google?
The ads present an interesting model, given that many ads on YouTube currently give viewers the option to skip to the video after a few seconds. But there are also ads that run for a full 15 seconds, so by comparison these bumper ads (I refuse to call them haiku) seem like an excellent alternative.

It might be hard to remember, but before smartphones, we had no need to worry about our phones dying. The phones themselves were marvelously efficient, sometimes lasting weeks on a single charge, and they were also garbage that couldn’t do anything fun, so we didn’t really use them that much anyway.
The most important number to remember is the amp count, which measures how fast the battery is charging. You’ll want an amp count of more than two, which could be labeled with the specific amp rating (2.4, say), or labeled as “fast charging” or something like that.
The question is: Which one should you buy? The external battery pack is a very rewarding category to shop for because basically all of them are fine, but it’s easy to end up with a slightly better one, and feel really great about your shopping prowess.
Most smartphones now last about a day before dying. An intensive session — streaming video, playing games, using turn-by-turn GPS navigation —could kill them even faster than that. And therefore many companies have thoughtfully begun to sell external battery packs, which are usually quite cheap and can be tossed into a bag or purse for those times when you really need to listen to a podcast on the subway home but are down deep in the red, just a few lines of pixels remaining within your transparent battery symbol.
External battery packs vary in capacity, which affects how many times you can refill your phone’s battery; they vary in amps, which affects how quickly your phone recharges; they sometimes have built-in cables for iPhones or micro-USB cables for basically all non-Apple devices, or just a USB port so you can supply your own cable; and sometimes they vary in shape, from batteries that snap onto a phone like a case to credit-card-sized thin batteries to big ugly clunkers.
So: Here are three tips to make shopping for your smartphone battery-pack easy.
Get a battery with an amp count over two.
So ask yourself how many times you want to be able to charge your phone fully. Once, just for an emergency? Get a pocket-sized pack. Twice? Shoot for a battery at around 7,000 mAh. Eight times while you’re on vacation in the jungle? Get the tank.
Understand the battery’s capacity.
Capacity is directly related to the physical size of the phone’s battery pack. The iPhone 6s Plus, a very large phone, has a battery capacity of 2,750 mAh. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has an even bigger one, at 3,600 mAh. The regular iPhone 6s, for its part, has a battery capacity of 1,715 mAh. The tiniest battery packs, like this Anker, have a battery size just around the same size as a large phone’s (the Anker’s is 3,350 mAh). A giant battery, like this one from RavPower, can handle 16,750 mAh.
Forget all the numbers and just get one of these.
Here’s the big problem with most battery packs. Say you’re going on vacation, and need to bring your convenient, portable external battery pack. If you have a standard battery pack, here’s what you’ll be bringing:
1) Your phone
2) Your external battery pack
3) Your cable that goes from the phone to the battery pack
4) A wall charger
5) Another cable to charge your external battery pack (most battery packs use micro-USB, iPhones do not, so you’ll need two different cables to charge those two devices)
6) Maybe even another wall charger, if you want to charge your phone and battery pack at the same time
3) The cable that goes from the phone to the battery pack
That’s it! You can use the battery pack the way you’d use any other pack, but you can also plug it right into the wall to charge it. Even better, when it’s plugged into the wall, you can plug in your phone, and your phone and the charger will both charge simultaneously. It’s clean, it’s neat, no need for extra garbage.
This is too much stuff! My solution is to get one of the damnably, inexplicably few external battery packs out there that have prongs for a wall-charger built right in. Monoprice makes a few (this $15 model, with a one-charge capacity of 3,000 mAh, is nicely small, but slow, at only 1 Amp of charging power), as does Zagg (for $16, twice the capacity of the Monoprice with a fast 2.1-Amp speed). Here’s what you bring for these things:

Yesterday, a guy named Rurik Bradbury wrote a piece for Esquire’s website called “Why I’m Joining the Innovation Party.” The impetus was an asinine Wall Street Journal op-ed by Politico CEO Jim VandeHei arguing, basically, that Mark Zuckerberg should run for president — in other words, a ripe target for the kind of guy who runs a Twitter account parodying tech-industry new-media snake-oil bullshit.
If you’re the kind of person whose job, or, worse, interests lead you to read a lot of very similar (but actually earnest) essays on Medium about the future of technology, media, tech media, media tech, disruption, or innovation, the Esquire post was a funny bit of satire. The Esquire piece included “thinkfluencer” gibberish like:
The byline on the piece was “Prof. Jeff Jarvis.” Here’s where it got tricky: “Prof. Jeff Jarvis” isn’t former Entertainment Weekly editor and well-known future-of-media pontificator Jeff Jarvis. Rather, it’s a character developed in a parody Twitter account run by Bradbury. Well-known in certain media circles, @ProfJeffJarvis initially satirized the thoughts of Jarvis himself before growing into a more general and very funny riff on the pie-in-the-sky gambits of new media.
The piece has now disappeared from Esquire’s website, apparently because the real Jeff Jarvis, also a journalism professor, “emailed […] Hearst executives” who “brought in other editors,” setting up a chain of events that seem to have resulted in the piece being removed entirely.
Jarvis (real) has frequently complained about Jarvis (prof), and Jarvis (prof) has frequently fooled well-meaning interlocutors, like the economist Nicholas Nassim Taleb and, once Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, into believing he’s Jarvis (real). Last December, a similar bit of satire was pulled from the Al-Jazeera America website; in 2014, real Jarvis wrote a post on his website, BuzzMachine, “What Society Are We Building Here?”
But now he’s really had enough. You can tell he’s had enough because he wrote a Medium post titled “Enough,” in which the real Jarvis took aim at his doppelganger.
A parody subject’s quest against his satirizer is, generally, quixotic. One of the most famous First Amendment cases of the 20th century involved the Reverend Jerry Falwell suing Hustler over a parody ad. Falwell lost, and Jarvis would have a similarly difficult time trying to sue Bradbury. And, maybe more importantly, complaints about a smaller and less well-known person’s not-particularly-cruel parody tend to fall on deaf ears. Especially if those complaints take on the apocalyptic tenor of “What Society Are We Building Here?” And especially if the complainant is a professor of journalism.
But, well, the thing is, Jarvis actually has a point — not that the post should be removed, or that the parody is particularly cruel, but that web users, by and large, take things at face value. It’s why fake news is such a viable market and parody accounts pretending to be quote-unquote “epic” comedians like Will Ferrell and Bill Murray proliferate. Before the piece was taken down, Esquire qualified the fake Jarvis’s byline with the phrase “A Well-Known Satirist,” except no, nah, nope. To expect the readers of a mainstream national magazine to understand @ProfJeffJarvis’s whole schtick is assuming a bit much.
There are different barriers to discovery on different platforms. You might find @ProfJeffJarvis on Twitter, where a retweet from a friend or a passing @-mention work as personalized endorsements from those you already know. That is an entirely different form of discovery than seeing his byline on the front page of Esquire.com.
Satire leans heavily on its imagined audiences: people who “get” and applaud the joke, and people who don’t, but for whom the joke should be instructive. On the web, though, it’s much harder to direct your work toward the right set of people. Your possible (and even likely) readership is everyone with an internet connection. Your satire is being read not just by people who “get” it and people who don’t but should, but also by people who don’t have any idea what “it” is. And it certainly doesn’t help that this all happens in text form. Maybe the only site doing it well is the Onion, and that’s partially due to their legacy status. The problem (“problem”) has gotten to the point where Facebook attempted to introduce a [SATIRE] tag to automatically alert users to sarcastic articles. It was a great idea that was extremely effective and everyone loved it.
Will Ferrell can afford to have a parody account, because he’s a famous celeb not trying to position himself as a new-media expert. Jarvis — who has even been consulted by this writer on one occasion — doesn’t have that luxury. Which, again, is not to say that the fake Jarvis did not write a very funny piece or that it should have been retracted! Only that it suffered from a cardinal sin of blogging: assuming that the reader understood the joke.
This week in Australia, Tinder launched a new product called Tinder Social, which lets one group of friends connect with other groups of friends. (Because that’s what everyone is looking for when they join Tinder: friends.)
It has memory-foam padding, touch-sensor display, and super-loud speakers. All the better to wake you up.
It isn’t surprising that online discourse is so consistently toxic. Human speech may have evolved, in part, as a means of gossiping, and for thousands of years our species has exhibited a keen interest in yelling at, insulting, and spreading rumors about one another. The online world, as a result of both the anonymity and the various social and network incentives it offers to users, makes it easier than it has ever been to rant and rave at the evilness of one’s enemies.
When you dive into these communities, certain patterns emerge. One I’m particularly interested in is the Irrelevant-GIF Outrage Cycle, or IGOC. It’s wreaking havoc on people’s abilities to have productive conversations with one another. It’s convincing people that everyone they disagree with is a mindless zealot. It’s never going to end.
Some corners of the internet are more civil than others, of course — there isn’t perfect overlap between “internet communication” and “insane internet communication.” But in those communities most marked by paranoia, anger, and rumormongering — and there seem to be more of them each day — it’s worth peeking in and trying to unpack exactly what’s going on.
This Facebook post raising the alarms over a supposed pro-ISIS rally by Dearborn, Michigan, Muslims is an example of an image that sparked an IGOC. As I wrote in December, the image comes with the text, “These are isis flags and isis supporters folks but the media has not reported because of politically correctness [sic throughout]:
Here’s how IGOC works: First, someone posts a GIF making some sort of argument to an online community, whether Twitter, Reddit, or whatever else (technically it could be a JPEG or a PNG, but let’s not be nerds about it). The GIF’s argument impugns some person or group. But that argument — and this is crucial — is irrelevant. Either it’s simply false, it reflects a fringe opinion on the part of a member of the group being attacked, it was created by a troll in the first place, or some combination of the three. In the case above, the GIF is irrelevant because it’s false — as I showed, the photo in question was from an anti-ISIS rally.
But because of how ideological communities work, many if not most of the image’s target recipients fail to grasp this. Instead, they are outraged: How could [feminists/liberals/the government/Bernie supporters/whatever] be so [dumb/evil/hateful/whatever]? So that’s the second stage of the IGOC: fury at what’s contained in the GIF and/or its accompanying text, often manifesting in the form of comments about the GIF in question.
Which leads us to the third stage: The hunt for more evidence that the group in question is dumb/evil/hateful/whatever. Pissed off at the GIF’s horrors, more people get drawn into the crusade against feminists or liberals or the government or whatever. They head further down the rabbit hole of anti-whatever content. They marinate in their own juices. They “investigate” the targeted group to find more evidence of the horrors it has inflicted and/or posted to Tumblr. Meanwhile, trolls, naturally fans of drama, realize that they can simply create this sort of content to get a rise out of people.
Sometimes, an irrelevant image is so outrageous, and offers such stark proof of a group’s awfulness, that it gets multiple spins through the IGOC. Take the almost-certainly-troll “feminist” Tumblr called “Destroy the Patriarchy”! One post features a screencap of a real tweet from a woman named Karen Ingala Smith in which she writes that “Anybody pushing a gender neutral approach to domestic - or sexual - violence is just a male violence enabler.”
This isn’t a particularly compelling satire even of the most radical feminist argument. No one who matters, anywhere, is arguing that men can’t be abused or that “women cannot be domestic abusers.” This is almost certainly trolling.
That wasn’t this particular Tumblr post’s first ride around the block. Here it is six months ago on the Tumblrinaction subreddit, garnering 115 comments. It was eventually added to that subreddit’s tellingly lengthy list of known troll blogs which submitters are instructed to ignore, because the subreddit is interested in actual Tumblr dumbness. Here it is garnering an angry retort from another Tumblr blog a ways back (the reblogger thinks the original poster is a “bitch”), with hundreds of likes, notes, and reblogs. This isn’t white-llama-black-llama-escaping-the-zoo virality, but a lot of people spent a lot of time getting mad about a blog post that was, in all likelihood, written specifically to piss people off rather than to make any sort of actual point about anything. And, along the way, they got convinced that “feminists” think men can’t be abused, nudging what is already a trash-fire internet discourse on that subject further into spittle-flecked inanity.
Naturally, though, the angrier corners of the internet didn’t get the joke. Last week a screencap of the post was published on KotakuInAction, the Gamergate subreddit, with the headline “The most dishonest and hateful against men post I’ve read this month.” In the comments, it’s clear that many readers believe what they’re seeing, and view the Tumblr post as confirming what they already knew about feminism: “I’m speechless… utterly speechless… First sentence, and… idk… Like, I want to make a quip or joke or something… but I can’t even fix this amount of stupid…,” wrote one. Another wrote: “‘Feminsts’ are dishonest as hell like that: any other day, women are empowering themselves and are proud stronk wymxn who don’t need no man, but when it comes to domestic violence, women are always the poor innocent victims, and they are NEVER violent for no reason, so they shouldn’t be held responsible for their actions, because they are oppressed and are just lashing out against the white cishet PatriarchyTM oppressing them. [sic throughout]”
Let’s not act like as though it’s only reactionaries who engage in IGOCs, though. Just earlier this week, Tim Robbins tweeted this out:
Suffice it to say there is no actual evidence of election fraud in this image And yet the IGOC commenced anyway: When a GIF announces to you what you already know — that dark corporatist forces are swirling around the Democratic primary with the goal of stealing it from its rightful winner, Bernie Sanders — the proper response is not to question, but to share.
Much of this, of course, goes to the weird credibility we lend GIFs, or screencaps in general. Whereas a link can break, or the text on the other side of it changed, an image is “permanent” in the sense that it can be rapidly circulated in a stable way. GIFs are a staple of “proof” in conspiracy-minded communities (at its peak, Gamergate produced some legendary IMGUR links “proving” a massive, far-reaching conspiracy on the part of games journalists to sully the gamer identity), and it makes perfect sense that they are often the preferred way of communicating information about one’s enemies: In most cases, they require little cognitive processing to absorb; they skirt Twitter’s character-length requirement; and they are more visually striking than regular text. Whether or not they’re true doesn’t matter, because of course they’re true.
More importantly, the structure and incentives of social media reinforce IGOC tendencies. Because it is so effortless to retweet or share, and because we are more likely to do so when we are emotionally aroused by content, these outrage cycles will percolate forever. When you’re a member of an online community committed to what you view as some social good, it feels good to participate in the identification and ridicule of your enemy, especially if all your online buddies are. There are zero factual standards for what does and doesn’t get published on social media. It’s all determined by how outraged the content in question makes people, and the extent to which it fits into deeply carved cognitive grooves.
In other words: The debunkers here don’t have a shot. They are a tiny whisper during an angry orchestra’s crescendo. Online, content telling an outrageous story — Hillary is stealing the election! Feminists don’t care if women beat the shit out of men! — will always, always, always win out, and usually win out exponentially, over people asking Wait, are you sure this makes sense?
IGOCs are just one part of this broader story, and they usually don’t involve mega-viral images. Usually, it’s 100 shares here, 2,000 there. But in the aggregate, this represents an astounding, depressing amount of time spent yelling at phantoms. There are legitimate arguments to be had about feminism and ISIS and the Democratic primary. But IGOCs, like so many other features of ideologically driven online networks, seek to ensure that meaningful conversations between people with differing views rarely, if ever, occur. Discourse becomes not a halting, incremental, awkward attempt to forge some sort of common understanding based on a shared understanding of what reality is, but rather a relentless investigation into the other side’s bottomless, incomprehensible nefariousness. For connoisseurs of this sort of thing, the internet presents an all-you-can-eat buffet: There will always be another GIF telling you your enemies are stupid. There will always be another outrage, because those people just don’t get it.
The author of the post then continues:
I’m lying naked in a doctor’s office and a nurse is standing over me, booty tilted toward my forehead. She’s trying to insert a butt plug where God and sex-toy manufacturers intended. It keeps slipping out. I look over to the corner of the room and then back to her, up and down her body as it towers over mine. “It’s just too big,” she says in a silken whisper. But she manages. Butt plug in place, the nurse lowers herself onto me.
The first step was getting together the necessary tools. The Oculus, priced at $599.99, might be the gadget of choice for the wealthy porn aficionado, but it was clearly beyond my budget. I went with the people’s VR headset: Google Cardboard, only $17. I got this one, but there are several different models that work for all sorts of phones. It was pretty easy to fold the flat cube of cardboard into something that resembled a homemade View-Master, though mine wouldn’t entirely stay closed so I had to use a piece of duct tape. (I can’t tell if it’s reassuring or terrifying that our new virtual future is as bootleg as our present.)
And if you want to know what that’s going to be like, you need to watch some porn. If VHS, DVD, and streaming video have taught us anything, it’s that the adult industry is always a few years ahead of its less prurient cousins when it comes to finding uses for technology. In other words: Porn is doing today what Hollywood will be doing tomorrow. I owed it to my fellow man to find out what that is, exactly.
That’s when I put down the headset.
As a homosexual of the highest order, I haven’t been inside a vagina since I came out of one headfirst, more than three decades ago. It feels weird to find myself screwing a female nurse. But it feels even weirder to realize that I’m just sitting here on my couch, pitching a prodigious tent in my jeans. VR porn is so good it even got this gay dude all riled up.
You see: I’m not in a doctor’s office. There’s no sexy nurse standing over me. The man lying on the examination table has flat abs, a hairy stomach, and a big penis — none of which I possess. I’m actually sitting on my sofa, holding a cube of cardboard, my cell phone tucked inside it like a swaddling baby. I’m watching VR porn, and I’m confused as hell.
When I first started reading about virtual reality for regular folks, I knew VR porn couldn’t be that far away. Now that much-hyped gadgets like Facebook’s Oculus Rift are available, and tech and video-game companies are investing billions in the technology, it’s only a matter of time before we’re all regularly avoiding our families with a pair of goggles or a strap-on headset.
Having dipped my virtual toe in the world of hetero porn, I thought it was time to find something that was geared more toward me. Leave it to the people at San Francisco-based Kink.com to deliver. They have a VR site featuring 13 completely free scenes. While all of them cater to the S&M crowd, there is every configuration you could hope for: boy/girl, boy/boy, girl/girl, just a girl, boy/boy/boy, and girl/girl/fuck machine.
Let’s start with the less sexy stuff. The user interface works smoothly and seamlessly. The movie itself is meant to be a hands-free experience — because, well, you know. You can fast-forward the video or realign the image by moving your gaze toward on-screen controls. (You can also dismiss the control menu, because nothing kills the mood more than a giant floating pause button.)
You get the complete opposite experience with VR porn. Here, with your earbuds in and goggles over your eyes, it’s totally immersive. When you look up, there’s a ceiling above you. When you look left, you can see your sexy nurse. The camera trains on whatever it is that interests you most, whether that’s Dr. Nikki’s breasts or the weird anatomy poster on the wall. There’s no cameraman forcing your POV, just you. The image quality isn’t exactly HD (the Google Cardboard acts as a magnifying lens for the phone screen, so you can see individual pixels) but you really do feel like you’re there — with the caveat, obviously, that the sensations felt by your avatar aren’t quite the same as those you’re feeling. Unless you’re really good at keeping tempo.
Thus equipped, it was time to find some porn. My first stop was the website of the enormous porn studio Naughty America, where you can find about 50 VR movies geared entirely to straight guys. I scrolled through the library and decided to go with Dr. Nikki, Assologist, starring Nikki Benz, mostly because of the title. (Okay, entirely because of the title.)
But you’re not here to hear about the design, right? Let’s talk sexiness. The idea behind “POV,” or point-of-view, porn — filmed, as you might gather, from the point of view of one performer — has always been that viewers can more easily imagine themselves in the scene. But it rarely works that way. When watching porn in the traditional manner, there’s a distance between yourself and the actual screen. You can’t feel like you’re the lucky dude in the movie because you know that you’re watching a movie.
On the site, there’s a little button under the movie summary that reads, “Watch This Fantasy Now,” but that’s a bit misleading. VR porn isn’t nearly as easy to view as the old-fashioned kind; there’s a whole process involved. Between downloading the video and the appropriate app, syncing your phone, and selecting your playback mode — depending on what gadget you’re using and how the movie was filmed — you could be spending 20 minutes in Dr. Nikki’s waiting room. It might seem like it’s not worth all the hassle. But VR porn is actually a pretty awesome experience.
This speaks to the biggest current problem with VR porn: Small quirks and interruptions are more distracting than they would be on a regular screen. You’re looking for an immersive experience, after all, and there’s not much that’s immersive about odd angles and weird visual tics. The lenses make use of stereoscopic vision, combining two slightly different images to create the illusion of depth, and when the two don’t line up, it’s disorienting. And every once in a while there are some weird perspective issues: In Dr. Nikki, Assologist, when you — well, the performer — stand over the titular medical professional, the movie turns into Attack of the 50-Foot Penis, with poor Dr. Nikki shrunken and seemingly in the distance, like the dirtiest scene cut from Alice in Wonderland.
If you’re going to play around in a virtual environment, you may as well go to a depraved sex den where a master whips a boy and forces him to serve someone. Alas, something weird happened when I entered the dungeon: It kept pulling to the right. It was like trying to eat a plate of fries when the waitress was steadily moving it inches away from me. To look “straight ahead” in the scene, I had to keep my head cocked over my right shoulder — incredibly uncomfortable considering all the other strenuous activity I was engaging in. (There’s a way to re-center the video using the pointer control, but it’s annoying, and I had to keep doing it every three minutes or so during the scene.)
By the same token, it can be a problem when the immersion works too well. In the Kink scene I started from the point of view of Jesse Colter, who was getting Jonah Marx off using all of my — er, his — orifices. But, unexpectedly, the POV switched — and I was suddenly looking through Jonah’s eyes as Jesse got him off. It was like a betrayal: I didn’t want to be someone else, especially a bottom sporting two sets of pinkish cheeks from being slapped and spanked so much. If I was going to be Jesse Colter (and, oh, to be Jesse Colter, just for a day), I wanted to be him the whole time.
It’s just like sex. Actually, it might even be a little bit better. You don’t have to deal with the mess, pain, and the worry of pleasing another person as well as yourself.
Of course, pre-filmed POV porn isn’t the only way to have adult experiences in virtual reality. Camming companies — websites where performers put on shows over webcam, usually in exchange for tips from viewers — are eager to cash in on this new technology, too. CamSoda puts on a bimonthly 360-degree 3D session with women in a room doing all sorts of things. In a recorded clip the company showed me, a single room contained eight women, one Hula-Hooping topless, others mugging for the camera, and one moaning in the corner as a robotic dildo machine did its work.
On the other hand, I thoroughly enjoyed the perspective shift in Tough Guys, from Virtual Real Porn, the only site I could find that specializes in VR porn. A few minutes into the video, which stars overly tattooed stud Antonio Miracle giving it to Mario Domenech, the point of view shifts from the pitcher to the catcher, and now I’m looking through Mario’s eyes. Suddenly “I” am being railed by the hot, muscled, tattooed Euro man of my dreams. I can look up and see into his eyes, I can look down and see a body that’s, well, what I’d like to see when looking down during sex. And, well, importantly, Mario is touching himself just like I am. Rather than pretending my hand feels like a mouth, I’m just pretending it feels like a hand. It’s almost entirely immersive: The only thing absent from the experience is someone else’s sweat dripping on me and the unmistakable smell of pheromones and lube.
To me, camming has always been the most boring form of porn: It’s live, and it’s customizable, but there’s rarely real, multi-person sex, and you have to share your favorite cam girl (or boy) with a room full of yahoos asking her to show off her feet — or something else stupid you just don’t care about. The VR room, while cool, didn’t exactly change my opinion.
But I’m not really the target audience. Daron Lundeen, CamSoda’s president, told me that the most successful cam girls are the ones who provide more than just sex. Models who can create a sense of intimacy and connection will get themselves repeat, and often high-paying, customers. “I can get off a lot more with a human connection than a super-high-def video,” Lundeen says. “For us it’s about connecting the people more. We think VR is going to do that.” Lundeen says he’s most looking forward to augmented-reality technologies — headsets that take what you see in the real world, and then add a layer of the virtual. Like, say, a cam girl sitting on your couch holding a glass of wine.
To Lundeen, this is the real future of VR porn: not the wild narrative fantasies of traditional porn, but the intimate “girlfriend experience” of escort work. It makes sense to me — but I’m also not sure you have to choose between the two. Isn’t that the beauty of the on-demand age? It’s all available to you with just the press of a button. Want to go to an orgy filled only with the hottest adult stars on the planet? Done. Want a nice young lady to tell you what a jerk your boss is before giving you a night to remember? Done. Want to be a top? A bottom? Both at the same time? Just want to complain about your boyfriend to a pretty, sympathetic face? It’s all possible. It might not be real, exactly, but sometimes that’s better.
There’s just one problem, Business Insider reports. As it’s currently being tested, you have to opt out. In other words, if you don’t want to be visible to your Facebook pals, you have to turn off the feature.
It’s easy to use: Since Tinder is already linked to Facebook, you can just select friends from your Facebook list and start swiping.
So if you’re in a committed relationship and just “haven’t deleted the app yet, but I will I promise” or are using Tinder for more nefarious reasons (say, cheating on your spouse) you’re probably going to want to opt out.
For now, Tinder Social is only available to a small test group in Australia. (Australia is also where the company first tested the Super Like. Who knew Aussies were so into swiping?)
Hopefully Tinder Social will make it’s global debut soon, so we can all use it for what it was obviously intended: orgies.
On Wednesday, Vogue UK posed a simple question on Twitter: “Who said that Kendall [Jenner] and Gigi [Hadid] are not ‘true supermodels’?”
Roughly 20,000 Airbnb users are estimated to be visiting New Orleans this week for the city’s annual Jazz Festival. According to Airbnb, via local ABC affiliate WGNO, guests are expected to bring in more than $17 million in revenue to the city.
New Orleans relies on its enormous tourist industry. But it also faces a housing shortage. And, unsurprisingly, local residents are less than thrilled that so much housing stock is being turned into short-term rentals.
Brutal. But, uh, enjoy the jazz festival!
NOLA visitors this weekend may have encountered flyers like this one: “Are you staying in an illegal short term rental listed on Airbnb or VRBO? If so, then YOU are directly responsible for displacing the last remaining long-time neighborhood residents that are survivors of the largest disaster that’s ever happened in America.”
The answer Vogue was looking for was “Rebecca Romijn,” who actually said, in the linked article, that Jenner and Hadid are not “true supermodels.”
The answer it got: everyone.”
Everyone on Twitter agrees: “Everyone” says Kendall and Gigi aren’t supermodels.
The hits just keep on coming.
BuzzFeed’s Grace Spelman points out that Jenner and Hadid, queens of social media elsewhere, are immensely disliked in the intense world of modeling fandom:

The Hydraulic Press Channel is one of the more straightforward channels on YouTube: A guy crushes stuff with a hydraulic press and remarks upon how awesome the destruction is. Sometimes his wife joins in. The videos, in which he destroys objects ranging from frozen toys to a jawbreaker, are weirdly, addictively compelling to watch — one of those strange instances of knowing exactly what’s coming, but not wanting to miss it. Think BuzzFeed’s viral watermelon stunt, but over and over and on a much-compressed time frame.
It’s hard to describe why the videos are so good. Obviously, the anticipation is part of it — it’s fun watching things explode, even when it’s not exactly unsurprising. (And yet there are still lots of pleasant surprises, weird hiccups, and unexpected outcomes along the way — a frozen ball of rubber bands, for example, splays out like a plate of spaghetti.)
It launched in October 2015 and became something of an instant hit — today it has more than 762,000 subscribers. Almost all of the videos have more than a million views, with one (“Can you fold paper more than 7 times with hydraulic press”) up over 10 million. Vuohensilta told me he did expect the channel to do well, but was surprised at its rapid ascent — he thought it would take a couple years of regularly publishing videos for it to catch on. Instead, the route to burgeoning YouTube stardom has been a fairly straightforward process.
The man behind the channel is Lauri Vuohensilta, a 29-year-old who lives in Tampere, Finland. The brilliant, simple idea first hit him, he told me, “About five months ago. My wife and I were walking outside, and I came up with this idea to make some kind of YouTube channel where maybe we break some stuff.”
He’d seen other destruction-focused channels — most notably carsandwater, devoted to playing with fire and melting stuff — and he knew they were popular. Vuohensilta runs a family machining business that makes use of, among other things, a hydraulic press, and, so, Hydraulic Press Channel was born.
Vuohensilta agrees: The videos, he told me, are “so exciting because stuff explodes, and strange things happen, and there’s the humor value of everything, my accent and stupid jokes.” The titles and descriptions of some of the videos — “Do not try this at home!! or at any where else!!” — give a sense of Vuohensilta’s deeply enthusiastic and slightly stilted vibe. He seemed particularly proud of his “Pressception” title — naturally, for a video in which he uses his hydraulic press to crush a smaller hydraulic press.
More than anything else, though, I think it’s the tension between the gleaming metallic brutality of the hydraulic press and the goofy nerdiness of Vuohensilta himself that animates the channel. The series’ title sequence features black-and-white clips of a hand fiddling with metallic machinery while heavy metal plays, lending a sense that there are some brotastic times ahead. In the hands of another host, this could be a men-being-men channel replete with beers and high-fiving, but Vuohensilta himself is a total goofball, a fact he knows and plays off of. Usually, the first thing you hear in the moments after the press finishes is a giggle — from Vuohensilta, his wife, or the both together.
In my personal favorite video, Vuohensilta tries to drive the press through a massive tome entitled “Suomi Englanti Suomi” — that is, an English-Finnish dictionary:
The press descends, and you expect it to punch easily through the book. Instead, it’s stalled by the sheer density of the pages being bunched together. “Fuck,” Vuohensilta exclaims over the whine of the machine at 0:59. The press comes up, with the book sticking to it, and Vuohensilta explains he’ll need something smaller to finish off the book. The camera cuts to a side view, and text appears on the screen (sic): “Our main cameras footage didn’t survived upcoming events so I have only this slomo-cameras footage.” Soon we see why — as the press descends in slow motion, suddenly the book explodes violently, taking out a bunch of the equipment around it, including the primary camera. The press always delivers, but sometimes it exacts a terrible cost along the way.
Now that his channel has caught on, he’s naturally looking to get more ambitious, to destroy bigger stuff. He said he’s excited about a 1,000-ton press he thinks he’ll soon have access to due to a sponsorship deal. “And with that the first thing I am going to press is a running lawnmower,” he said. “That’s going to be exciting, because there’s lots of moving and hot parts and gasoline and stuff like that.” He kept breaking into giggles as he described the carnage to come.
I asked Vuohensilta if he had any theories about why it’s so compelling to watch something be destroyed. “I have tried to figure that out myself many times,” he said. “But I think it’s something that all people want to see in some way. I remember when we were children and we liked to break stuff, and — I think it’s somehow inside of [the] human mind to break stuff.”
It’s prom season and you know what that means: plenty of opportunity to make young women feel badly about themselves, and their bodies, and then turn the ensuing righteous anger into viral content.
Which is what happened to a Tennessee teenager named Amy, who arrived at her prom only to be told she needed to cover herself up with the vice-principal’s tuxedo jacket (ew) if she wanted to enter the dance.
A parent of another student at the school shared Amy’s story on Facebook, where it has since been like over 40,000 times and shared another 12,000.
A representative from Amy’s school told News 10 ABC the school does not have a dress code for prom and that no other female students were made to cover up at the dance.
Lucky Amy.
Things only got worse from there.
Snapchat is fun. Snapchat is great. Snapchat definitely isn’t meant to be used while driving at insane speeds just so you can impress your friends.
In September, Georgia Uber driver Wentworth Maynard was hit by a woman named Christal McGee, who was allegedly driving 107 mph so she could send her friends a Snapchat, CNN reports.
In case you don’t snap regularly, Snapchat has a built-in filter that shows you how fast you are going while taking a selfie.
It looks like this. (Please note this selfie was taken by an airplane passenger and not somebody operating a motor vehicle.)
Now Maynard is suing both McGee and Snapchat for damages. Following the accident, he spent several weeks in intensive care for a traumatic brain injury and is currently unable to work.
We’re about to undergo a similar shift on two fronts, both of which we’ll talk about below. The most important thing to know is that it’s possible to buy a TV today that you won’t regret owning in 2020. But if you don’t pay attention to a handful of key decisions, it’d be extremely easy to end up with a TV you wish you didn’t have come next year.
Here’s a minor caveat: The bigger the TV you get, the bigger the benefit of stepping up to 4k. If you’re just looking at a 32-incher for your bedroom, don’t bother.
The even better motivator? If you want the best TV you can buy — and you do, if you want future-proofing — you need to get a 4K set. Manufacturers have made the jump completely, and they save all of the other specs that make a TV experience great (and lasting) for their top-end products. In other words, if doesn’t have 4K, it also won’t have the very best of everything else. You deserve the best.
The one exception to this, at least so far, is that Vizio’s new televisions come with what amounts to a built-in Chromecast, meaning you can toss whatever’s on your phone — including streams from Netflix and ESPN and whatever else — to your TV with one tap. They also come with a tablet as a remote? Sure! Why not?
Nah. Curved TVs look cool when they’re off (maybe?), but you’re just paying more for less viewing angle.
At the risk of oversimplifying, artificial neural networks (ANN) are a powerful form of machine learning, modeled on the neural networks in our brains. They can be used to defeat humans at Go, or help determine one’s eligibility for a loan, or automatically label photos. Depending on the pool of data they work from, they can also be racist, or at least reflect deep institutional biases. Remember all those upsetting magic eye-style images that went viral in 2015? They were made using Google’s DeepDream neural network. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN, a form of ANN) can generate weird versions of Shakespeare or Donald Trump speeches.
After a few more bizarre early iterations (featuring brief appearances of the new characters “Danky” and “Bendy”) we eventually arrived at a decent-enough version, in which everyone keeps hugging, walking up and down stairs, and apologizing. According to our computer, that’s the essence of Full House. It’s not necessarily wrong.
Simultaneously, there’s an interesting tension at play. The errors suggest the ineffable quality of our sense of humor, and underscore our essential humanness. Maybe there’s some relief to this: If robots can’t yet master something like comedy — even the most formulaic versions of it — maybe they won’t be able to crush humanity in their greasy clamps after all.
The most irritating thing about Snapchat is that there’s no “discover” feature. Finding friends to follow on the app is confusing; finding anyone else at all is a lost cause. (Unless you read our Snapchat 101 list, of course!)
Next tap on the name of one of your friends. I picked my sister, Bailey. (Mom, if you’re reading this, please note Bailey is one of my “BEST FRIENDS.”)
Unless you know this quick hack that lets you tell who’s added you back, as Snapchatter Cyrene Quiamco showed us.
On top of that, there’s seemingly no way to tell which friends you’ve added have added you back. (This means it’s hard to tell which of your friends actually want to receive your 16 daily selfies with the flower-crown filter.)
This ball lets you play with your pets while your gone. We imagine it might also work to spy on roommates? Not that we condone that sort of behavior.Produced by Christine Nguyen. Written by Cait Munro. Video courtesy PlayDate.
The decline in revenue for Apple is primarily attributable to two interconnected things. First, iPhone sales declined 18 percent over the same quarter last year — a hefty chunk, and even more significant when figuring in that iPhones represent two-thirds of Apple’s business. Along with this, Apple’s aggressive push into the Chinese technology market doesn’t appear to be paying off. The New York Times reports that the iPhone is no longer the tastemaker status symbol in China that it was just a couple of years ago.
It used to be the case that Apple, on the strength of its astounding phone (and, to a lesser extent, computer) sales, had the exciting earnings calls to talk up astronomical growth and huge revenue. Now, as Facebook has foregone hardware to focus on controlling the (very mutable) foundation upon which billions of people use the web, they’ve created a service that will conceivably outlive even the most radical shifts in hardware.
But networked platforms and the cloud have made client-side hardware improvements less significant. You don’t really need a processor with a zillion cores and 128 gigs of RAM on your machine unless you want to play complex video games or do an astronomical amount of number-crunching. The whole point of cloud computing is that those hardware changes happen behind the scenes, otherwise known as server-side. Instead of Apple designing, testing, and manufacturing a consumer-level hardware revision every year (and then convincing millions to buy it), Facebook can tweak its comparatively minuscule army of servers. According to a report earlier this week, Facebook is putting pressure on hardware manufacturers to drive down prices — hardware being the razor to software-as-a-service’s blades.
At the same time, it’s difficult to imagine how much more can be done to the smartphone in its current slim rectangular form: better camera, faster chips, longer battery, and… uh… chamfers? Gadget writers love to complain about the lack of groundbreaking upgrades, but the increasing insignificance of changes in iPhone design from year to year are, as much as anything else, a sign that the smartphone has gotten as good as it’s going to get. That malaise partially explains all of the hype surround virtual reality. VR has, in short, created a whole new paradigm for interacting with hardware, and thus justified its manufacture. (Facebook is positioning itself well for dominating the next hardware cycle, if it’s VR, by purchasing Oculus Rift.)
And so we’re leaving an era driven by hardware and entering one driven by software. You can already see the transition. You might watch HD video over streaming, processing thousands of tiny packets instead of one enormous local video file. Multiple video-game companies have tried to stream games, meaning that the player does not control their own computer, but one remotely. The only thing local hardware has to do is process the video stream. Apple’s iPhone-sales engine isn’t as powerful as Facebook’s enormous platform. Even services like Siri and the impending legion of messaging chatbots engage in Natural Language Processing by sending the data outside the confines of your phone. If the truly significant hardware bumps are happening remotely, then what’s the point of buying a new iPhone every year?
The internet loves to laugh at meteorologists. Anytime an unsuspecting weatherperson is attacked by a giant bug or sees a storm shaped like, uh, an eggplant, the web goes nuts.
But no body-part-shaped storm is as alarming, no bug as terrifying, as a Windows 10 update recommendation. And so it’s happening again today, with this clip of Iowa meteorologist Metinka Slater reporting the weather:
The video is quickly moving to the top of the /r/video subreddit and has already been viewed by over 100,000 people on YouTube.
“Microsoft wants me to upgrade to Windows 10,” Slater jokes after turning around to discover her map had been taken hostage by the notification.” Don’t you love when that pops up, huh?”
Or you can play Streets of Rage 2 Except It Makes That Weird Tim Allen Noise When People Die:
Milo Yiannopoulos, the far-right website Breitbart’s formerly Twitter-verified, possibly-44-intern-having troll, is in the midst of his “Dangerous Faggot” college tour (he has given his straight readers permission to use this slur, and if you poke around at his fans’ social-media presences, they enjoy taking advantage of this opportunity). At college after college, university after university, he is telling packed halls full of primarily white and primarily male student fans of his what they want to hear: It is time to fight back against the feminists and social-justice warriors and diversity-mongers who control the world both behind the scenes and in the halls of academia.
Yiannopoulos is, by design, an infuriating figure. He thrives off attention and reaction to his constant offensive remarks. But if you can set that aside — and set aside both his and Breitbart’s numerous ethical and journalistic lapses — it’s hard not to be impressed at what Breitbart is pulling off in its coverage of this tour. It has created a rich, reinforcing feedback loop of predictable outrage generated by young college students, outraged coverage of that outrage, and, in turn, ever more attention for its most controversial writer.
I wanted to know; by this point I was weirdly titillated at the idea of a real conversation with a man I’ve only heard repeat things like “Mickey Chocolate Egg” and “Fashems NumNoms” to distraction. But when I asked him for an interview, he said he wasn’t interested. I wish I could have asked him how much Kinder chocolate he has to throw away.
Some of the parents I informally polled told me their kids would often rather watch character toy videos than the actual TV show from whence the characters come. “They absolutely watch the videos of adults playing with toys more than the media the toys are drawn from,” agrees another parent, whom we’ll call F. “Which is super weird. We had to convince them to watch Big Hero 6 after seeing the toys all over the YouTube feed. Like, they didn’t believe me that they’d like it. It was surreal.”
But none of the parents I spoke to said their child’s fixation on the videos has actually led to a real-world insistence on more toys or more property. The surprise-egg infrastructure is so prolific, and YouTube’s suggestion engine so well-tailored, that a child can navigate voluntarily among egg videos endlessly and never leave the site, and is unlikely to stumble accidentally upon anything unfriendly, which makes it feel like a safe compromise for parents.
“Today I’m going to show you 55 surprises,” a mellow man’s voice promises. The surprises are foil-wrapped sweets with tiny licensed toys inside. He has an accent I can’t place. I never see his face, only his hands very close up. He casts his hands over the seated and waiting eggs and settles on one. He turns it, slowly. Every facet of the foil wrap glitters, pastel cartoon pony faces whorled in metallic. The crinkle of the foil is, for a moment, the only noticeable sound. He removes it, as he always does, so neatly, all in one piece, like shucking a silver-bellied oyster.
Do you have $8 billion lying around? Because, boy, do we have an amazing (and definitely legitimate) opportunity for you.
But, obviously, when you want to sell an internet company, you don’t print out a flyer. You create a Craigslist ad, like this one first noted by Business Insider.
During last night’s NFL draft, someone had it out for Ole Miss linebacker Laremy Tunsil: Minutes before the draft began in Chicago, somebody posted a video of what appears to Tunsil smoking out of a gas mask.
Tunsil deleted his Twitter account, then revived it to apologize, then tweeted it out again. His representation tried to spin it as an old video from high school, and said the account was hacked. (The video’s apparently made the rounds: Deadspin was approached by someone trying to sell it earlier this month.)
Tunsil found out about the Instagram screenshots while speaking live with ESPN. Tunsil described the hack as “crazy” but seemed otherwise fine: He had, after all, just been signed by the Miami Dolphins. (Deadspin and TMZ both speculate that Tunsil’s stepfather Lindsey Miller may have been involved in the hack. Miller recently sued Tunsil for “intentional inflection of emotional distress.”)
After the video went up on Twitter, the Baltimore Ravens reportedly dropped Tunsil from consideration, according to NFL reporter Aditi Kinkhabwala, passing on him at number six.
But the social media clothesline didn’t stop there. Just minutes after the Miami Dolphins drafted Tunsil, screenshots appeared on his Instagram that appeared to show Tunsil asking coaches at Ole Miss for help paying his rent. Taking money from coaches is a violation of NCAA policy. Tunsil later admitted that he took money from coaches.
For Tunsil, though, someone was deploying embarrassing information on his social media accounts without his knowledge. Possibly for the first time ever, “I was hacked” appears to be used truthfully.
Samsung’s currently developing a new app, called Bedtime VR Stories, that will work with its Gear VR headsets to let parents read their kids to sleep, even when they’re out of town. Because what every kid needs is a bright immersive screen-based experience strapped to her head right before bed.
On one hand, this isn’t the first smart mirror (I’ve been drooling over this one since January). But on the other, Newlan said on Reddit he’d be updating his Medium page with his building process and that page remains entirely blank.
Well, at least the idea is sweet. And the the jury’s still out on whether VR is particularly bad for kids. (Though there is that whole “staring at screens can totally screw up your sleep patterns” thing.) The app hasn’t been released yet, but Samsung did publish a 360° video of what a story might look like using the app. The automated British narrator’s voice is just a bit creepy, but keep in mind that’s just a stand-in for a human adult reading to a kid. If you were raised by a British robot, then this will make you feel right at home:
Maybe just skip the VR bedtime story and call your kid on the phone?
I set my Gadget Man status aside years ago. Sometime around 2011 gadgets became boring; rectangles and apps, rather than specs and buttons. Gadget blogs became “design” blogs. More than anything else, they became easy: You didn’t need to know or memorize anything. You didn’t even need to own more than one gadget, really. You just … bought an iPhone. I lost interest, and bought an iPhone.
The decreasing prices of electronics would have been less noticeable to the average consumer five or ten years ago, when most electronics were bought and sold at big-box stores like Best Buy and Circuit City and Walmart. But with distribution moving online to Amazon and others, the barrier for entry into the electronics market has more or less disappeared, and the lack of documentation and opaque provenance of these cheap gadgets doesn’t matter much. All of a sudden, no-name, direct-from-factory gadgets are just about as accessible to the average consumer as anything from Apple or Sony or Samsung.
Let me back up. I used to be a Gadget Guy. I cared about specs and read message boards full of acronyms. Gadget Guys consider themselves connoisseurs, experts on the lesser-known brands that may or may not offer more bang for buck. (Working at Circuit City in high school I made a point of telling moms to buy the Creative NOMAD MP3 player rather than the iPod for their sons, because “the signal-to-noise ratio is far better” and “nobody’s going to want to be locked into Apple’s music store.” All I can do now is offer an unconditional apology to the Philadelphia-area teens who received Creative NOMADs for Christmas.)
I have a $60 projector made by a probably imaginary company called “D-POWER” that can only seem to keep, at most, three quarters of the picture in focus. I have an LG smartphone that can’t seem to reliably deliver text messages to or from any iPhone-using friends, which, here in Brooklyn, is another way of saying “all of my friends.” I have a USB hub that came with a ridiculous four-inch-long cable; a $12 smartwatch that alerts me with a vibration and a difficult-to-dismiss message for every one-percent change in my phone’s battery; a USB drive that lies about its storage capacity; and a Jambox-like wireless speaker that loudly proclaims in an accent, somewhere between Ukrainian and Japanese, that “ZE BLUETOOS DEWICE IS READY TO PAIRS.” When you connect a “dewice,” it cheerfully yells, “ZE BLUETOOS DEWICE IS CONNEKKID.”
Wish is a great app for finding shit electronics, but its reviews aren’t exactly helpful: The app automatically only surfaces four- or five-star reviews, so you see a lot of “I’m rating this five stars so people see my review, but this thing broke immediately and poisoned my cat.” EBay has a more extensive selection, but has the same problem: The review system is woefully inadequate. Amazon is your best bet: Search for the gadget you want using generic terms (“bluetooth speaker”), make sure the gadgets-rated-four-stars-and-up-only filter is off, and dive deep into garbage-tech bliss.
The beautiful thing about Amazon is that even the crap has extensive reviews, sometimes even with photography or videos of the gadget in action. It’s a pretty good way to gauge exactly how shitty the insanely cheap product you’re about to purchase actually is. (Many of the reviews come with statements that the company provided the gadget for free or cheap “in exchange for my unbiased opinion.” I have no idea how to get on those lists. D-POWER, if you read this, I would love to receive even cheaper garbage in exchange for my unbiased opinion.)
Just be careful. A few months back my girlfriend and I bought a car. Not from Wish: We bought a Honda Civic with a dented hood for less than $2,000. Perfect, but it needed a stereo. High on my recent success with the shit USB hub, I decided to go with a $21 crap stereo, a no-name item bought from eBay. I’m a genius, I thought. You’re an idiot, said my girlfriend.
They aren’t as good as an iPhone, a Jambox, an Epson, or a Logitech, but they are adequate, and, most importantly, much cheaper. They also come with an added element of danger and intrigue. They’re fractured reflections of the much-desired objects we obsess over, odd appendices of global mass manufacturing, cutting-edge technology made without a major corporation’s need for quality control and fear of releasing stuff that might not work.
I purchased these items at a ridiculously deep discount, sometimes up to 90 percent off the price of their brand-name inspirations, from the figurative back pages of Amazon and eBay and from my favorite app, Wish. They are made in many of the same factories in Shenzhen and Guangdong as the non-crap versions, and from many of the same components. (Sometimes garbage gadgets are made from component parts with minor or unnoticeable defects intended for, but turned away by, perfectionist companies like, say, Apple.)
Then I load up eBay again.
Or as LHC’s daily summary put it, “Not the best week for LHC!”
Instead of conducting further research on the Higgs boson particle (it’s important, Google it!), the LHC had to be shut down and it will be weeks before the collider can be fired up again, CERN’s head of press Arnaud Marsollier told NPR.
But perhaps sadder than the stunting of groundbreaking research is that the marten’s vandalism got him killed. (An earlier report from NPR said that CERN had yet to examine “the remains,” so we’re taking that as bad news for the little guy.)
Fellow weasels take note.
To the extent that there’s a defining image of the current era in sex trends, it’s the dick pic. It’s increasingly normal to find that people who date — or maybe even just know — men have a few megabytes worth of dicks on their phones. Dick pics are, for better and often for worse, just a part of how many people have sex today. Or, they are, if you have a dick or date people who possess them.
There’s an immediate and obvious answer — that good-old standby, the nudie pic — but I don’t think it’s quite right. Exchanging sexy selfies is an important part of any lesbian relationship in the digital age, but nudes don’t have the same je ne sais quoi of the dick pic — its impulsive lustiness, or, for that matter, cultural cachet.
Or maybe it’s nothing below the belt, at all. “What would be the lesbian version?” my friend Mary wondered. “I mean, our fingers are essentially our sex organs.” So, if the “lesbian dick” is the hand, then the lesbian dick pic, is, well … hand modeling?
You could get more specific. My friend Brannon wondered if, by “lesbian dick pic,” I meant a picture of a clitoris. Anatomically speaking, a clit pic is very nearly a dick pic: After all, the clit contains 8,000 nerve endings, four times as many as on the head of a penis, and clits get hard-ons.
Though, once we’re speaking anatomically, we should acknowledge that some lesbians have dicks. “I could conceive of a lesbian relationship, with one or more trans women, where such a ‘dick pic’ could be exchanged,” Jen Richards, a transgender writer and actress, told me. “Why not? Once you see a trans woman as a woman, her penis becomes part of a female body.”
It’s true that I once received a message from a woman on Tinder that just said “I like your hands” — but the fingers-as-dick-pic doesn’t seem to be the case in practice. Another time on Tinder, a woman I was casually chatting with started sending me pics of her middle and index fingers, suggesting sex — perhaps the equivalent of an unsolicited dick pic. I didn’t ever meet up with her.
I don’t. And as a woman who dates women, I feel left out of this particular sexual textual experience. I’ve never received a dick pic, and I’ve long wondered: Is there a gay woman’s equivalent? Is there a lesbian dick pic?
When the excitement was over, I wanted to share something. But not a selfie; that would have been too intimate. Instead I did what any self-possessed queerdo does: I took a pic of my wet, sticky, somewhat-tan-white-person-flesh-toned, silicone dick, and sent it to her after she said yes, she would like to receive it.
What about, say, sex toys? My friend Che says that she likes it when women she’s dating send pictures of themselves with a dildo. There are phalluses involved in these pics, and actions that suggest penetration — or do more than that.
And, well, I’m a lesbian; that’s a dick; ergo: lesbian dick pic.
Weirdly, I felt like I had been given sudden insight into being a guy. I felt like I understood why friends consensually share their own dick pics. It’s not really about the dick — it’s about the person you’re sending it to. Whether it’s something attached to your body or not, the dick pic is an image that proves you’re turned on, and, believe it or not, demonstrates some vulnerability — that sense of look what you’ve done to my body, I want to show you how much you made me want you, and I want this pic to turn you on.
Maybe the lesbian dick pic isn’t so much about the dick as it is about the lesbian. A few months ago, I was becoming entangled with a girl and we were texting or talking almost daily. One lazy Sunday afternoon, we ended up in a long phone conversation while she was driving to her parents’ house somewhere in L.A. I loved her voice, and the conversation was making me hot. So I — ahem — told her about the physical sensations I was experiencing, and next thing I knew I was holding my dildo in one hand.
This car vending machine could change the way people shop for cars, and it saves you money.
Five years ago, a teenager named John started a YouTube channel. Clad in a nice suit and wielding a voice that one might describe as “old-time radio newsman,” he set out to review hundreds of fast-food items and energy drinks. Since then, the simply named Report of the Week has grown into something of a cult phenomenon online, and John himself has become an idol.
Who is this guy? Why is he wearing a suit? How many suits does he own? We went straight to the source for answers. This … is the Report of the Week Report.
What was the initial idea behind Report of the Week? What did you set out to do?The idea came from watching this one guy on YouTube who did these pizza reviews. At the time I didn’t even have an intention of reviewing food. I just wanted to review energy drinks. It looked really neat to just talk about something and try it and say how it tastes and whatnot. “I’ll just make a few videos about these, put them on YouTube and see what happens.” But when I first started out with it I realized, Hey, this isn’t too bad. I kinda like being in front of the camera.
When do you think it started to take off? When did you notice that more people were watching and commenting on it?In January of 2013, I had just started doing food reviews of different items, and this video of mine where I reviewed the pan pizza from Domino’s, someone posted it on Reddit. I guess one of the few people who watched it at the time said, you know, “This guy, he sits there. He does these food reviews in a suit. I’ve never seen anything like it.” It started out with maybe 300 views at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day it had 300,000 views. So it was really this one day in January of 2013. People I guess had never seen a food review like it.
What’s interacting with fans like? What’s that dynamic?For the most part I’d say there’s two groups of fans. Two distinct groups. You have the people who are regulars. Then you have people who are just passing through. [The regulars are] very friendly, very nice. They’ll offer some constructive advice, but they’re never jerks. Those are the people who I really do the channel for. That’s probably a couple hundred people.
Now the people that I say are just passing by, this is where you get a mixed bag. You get some people who say, “These videos are nice. I subbed because of this.” And then you get people who are just innocuous. They’ll say, “Nice review.” And of course you get the trolls who, you know, post whatever comes to mind first, I figure. I always try to just be welcoming to everyone.
How many videos do you make a week now?In total, I have around 600 videos. Per week, sometimes it’s five, sometimes it’s four. If there’s, say, a new item from Taco Bell, I’ll put everything to the side and I’ll try to review that as soon as possible. I’ll try to prioritize. I try to do two or three food reviews per week of hopefully new fast-food items or items from major chains.
I also wanted to ask you about your on-camera persona. Do you wear suits all the time, or is that just something you do for the videos?A lot of people will say, “Are they costume pieces? Why do you wear the suits? What is it about the suits?” The suits themselves are not costume pieces. It’s what I wear every day. Right now as I’m talking to you I’ve got on a gray suit with a nice purple, striped tie. That’s what I’m just wearing today; I don’t even plan on filming anything. In a sense it’s what makes the channel stand out. I’m a guy in a suit who reviews everything.
What are your most memorable reviews?There was this one that ties in with Planet Wings. I decided I wanted to clear out their whole menu, do a review of each wing flavor. But the most well-known one that I did is for their suicide wings, which are supposed to be the hottest thing on the menu. I said to myself before I did the review, “I’ve had a lot of wings in the past. These will probably be hot, but it’s no big deal.” I just went in there, just downed a wing for the review. It was, my God, the hottest thing I’ve ever eaten. I didn’t even anticipate that. It took me completely off guard. So there I was sitting there trying to do this review. My mouth was burning. I was crying trying to get water and everything. That was an interesting one.
I couldn’t imagine finding a way to talk about wings for ten minutes. Is the length of your videos part of the entertainment value of it?I’d say definitely the length of the videos and also the quality of the videos themselves really are something that make the channel what it is. The style of humor that I do is oftentimes dry humor. It appeals to some people more than others. For instance, last night I did an energy-drink review. It was called Rockstar Revolt. The can had this army camo design and I decided to give a little talk about how I think they should call it — instead of “Rockstar Revolt” — they should call it “Rockstar Military Coup” instead. I doubt that really has a zing to it that really sells the product.
Let’s say you’re stranded on a desert island. You can only have three energy drinks and three foods. What are they?The three that I would bring is, of course, standard Monster Energy, the original. It’s very basic. I think it’s very good nonetheless. Second drink that I’d bring is this one called Bawls. That one is more of a specialty drink but it’s very nice. It’s like this little very pleasant, light, carbonated drink. Very good. Comes in different flavors. Third energy drink I’d bring, probably … you know, Monster Energy Drink, they always do such a good job with all of their products and they’re one of the lines of energy drinks that I respect the most. So I’d probably go with Juice Monster third. Again, because I just think it’s an excellently crafted drink. It’s able to combine these different flavors of fruity juices with the caffeine and it really leads it to be a very pleasant drink, especially in warmer weather.
As for food, the top-three food items I’d bring with me would be probably anything from Five Guys, specifically probably a burger with bacon on it. That’s always a great one, one of my favorite things to eat. Second thing I’d bring, I love this item from Pizza Hut: their stuffed-crust pizza with pepperoni. That was always a big favorite of mine. Third, I’d just bring some standard buffalo wings from a chain called Planet Wings. They’re a local chain. They serve mostly the Northeast, but they really do a good job with what they have.
What are you other hobbies? Outside of recording these videos, how do you fill your time?A lot of the time what I do is I enjoy writing. Lately I’ve been writing short stories anywhere between ten and 90 pages long. Another thing that I’ll fill my time with is — and this is probably another reason why I haven’t put on a ton of weight from all these reviews — is I’ll go out and enjoy nature. Usually I’ll try, if the weather’s nice, to take a good three-mile walk every evening. Another hobby that’s more of an interesting one is shortwave radio. It’s really not too popular over here anymore. Instead of just transmitting a signal that would be heard 50 miles away, it can be broadcast to other countries and be heard thousands of miles away.
Do you plan on running TheReportoftheWeek indefinitely?I don’t plan on stopping. Back in February when I did the five-year anniversary video I did this energy-drink review to kind of commemorate the channel having been there for five years. In the video I said, “I’m gonna keep doing this channel. I don’t have any plans on stopping. Assuming all goes well I’ll be back here for ten years.”

Eight years ago this very day, April 29, Bruno Mars was surprised to see Pete Wentz. We know this because there is photo proof of it. I have no idea what the provenance of the above photograph is, but, for at least two years, Tumblr has been celebrating April 29 — the day the singer of “Uptown Funk” passed the man who wrote “Sugar, We’re Goin Down” on the sidewalk.
Reached for comment, Wentz had this to say:
Happy holidays, Tumblr. Now, for your viewing pleasure, here is Fall Out Boy performing “Uptown Funk.”
But seriously where is that dog?
Zuck’s photo set has already racked up over 73,000 likes in 45 minutes, which officially puts to shame any picture of your dog you’ve ever put on the web.
Last week, the University of Wisconsin–Madison Snapchat story (a curated selection of photos and videos submitted by university students) was taken over by a very 2016 love story.
After spotting a guy in a Minnesota Vikings jersey on the story, an anonymous female student (later dubbed “Mystery Girl”) decided to try to track him down.
“I’m seriously in love with you,” she said in her snap. “Find me.”
The guy, now known as “Vikings Fan,” responded with a time and place for the two to meet up, but Mystery Girl didn’t see the snap. (Ugh, it’s like watching Sleepless in Seattle all over again.)
Still, the pair continued their attempts to coordinate a meetup. (Standard disclaimer: This is the internet; everything is viral marketing; take what you see with a healthy dose of salt.) Meanwhile, plenty of other students began to weigh in on Snapchat and Twitter, eager to see if their two classmates would ever meet up in person. Snapchat even created a “HELP VIKINGS FAN FIND MYSTERY GIRL” geofilter.
The real-life identities of Vikings Fan and Mystery Girl have still not been identified, so there’s no way to know what happened next or if the whole thing was staged. If you have any intel, please let us know.
The two eventually met up at a local bar, embracing in a strangely emotional hug that didn’t feel at all weird to watch.
And, of course, the whole thing was documented on Snapchat, as first reported by The Tab.
Prior to this morning the only reference points I had for “kangaroo” were Kanga and Roo, the adorable mother-and-son combo from Winnie the Pooh. But I now have a new reference point, and oh my God look at those claws.
Please watch this horrifying video that is currently making the rounds on Twitter, and join me in screaming at your computer screen.
[Screaming.]
This morning, Australian computer scientist Craig Wright came forward to claim the mantle of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious pseudonymous inventor of the decentralized cryptocurrency Bitcoin. If you recognize Wright’s name, it’s because he was outed last December as (maybe, probably) Nakamoto in simultaneous investigations published by Wired and Gizmodo — and then quickly dismissed when holes in the story immediately started to emerge.
The main method of verifying Wright’s identity as Nakamoto — who wrote the white paper on Bitcoin’s underlying system but stopped working on the project in 2011 — is through the use of cryptographic keys. Each Bitcoin transaction generates corresponding keys, so for the earliest Bitcoin transactions Wright should hold the keys. In a blog post published earlier today (agonizingly titled “Jean-Paul Sartre, Signing and Significance”) Wright went through a step-by-step process by which he outlined the process of key verification.
The Economist, which, along with the BBC and GQ, was given advance notice of Wright’s coming-out, wrote of the key verification:
Block 9 is one of the earliest bitcoin transactions, tracked in a public ledger called the “blockchain.” The Economist is careful to note that while Wright’s evidence is convincing, it’s not quite enough for the magazine to say definitively that Wright is Nakamoto: “We are not so sure,” the editors write, bluntly.
But Wright is smart enough to have convinced other major Bitcoin players of his legitimacy — including Gavin Andresen, heir to Nakamoto’s position as lead developer of Bitcoin. In a short blog post, Andresen wrote:
(Andresen also claims Wright’s demeanor seemed to match up with the personality of Satoshi, which, well, sure; we’ll have to take his word for it.)
Of course, Andresen’s support can create skepticism as much as settle it. Andresen is a core dev on the Bitcoin system, and therefore immensely powerful within the Bitcoin community. As much as Bitcoin users want to believe in the libertarian, decentralized currency, it’s still, at the end of the day, a computer program. Only a handful of people have the “commit privileges” necessary to alter the system’s code, meaning that Bitcoin’s future is still in the hands of a small circle of developers.
To that end, for roughly a year, the Bitcoin community at large has been embroiled in a controversy over the size of “blocks,” transaction data generated by the program and verified by “miners,” who get a reward for the verification. As of now, block size is currently limited to one megabyte, per Nakamoto’s original specifications, which caps the number of transactions at around seven per second. As The New Yorker describes it, some Bitcoin developers believe “that Bitcoin transaction volumes will blow past the seven-per-second limit by 2017, at the latest, creating backlogs, settlement delays, and perhaps even mass outages.” In the absence of the creator of Bitcoin, whose opinion might be considered definitive, the community has split into two camps: those who believe the block size should remain one megabyte, and those, like Andresen, who want to increase it. Were Nakamoto to weigh in definitively on one side or the other, it could sway many people from one side to the other.
Wright has already said he’d increase the block size, and because of this, his outing could be construed as an attempt to seize power as a chief authority over Bitcoin — and swing Bitcoin toward the increase-the-size camp. Again, from The Economist:
Over on the Bitcoin subreddit, users are already trying to poke holes in Wright’s story, claiming discoveries of code-breaking spelling mistakes and sly-joke key signatures.
At the same time, Peter Todd, another Bitcoin developer, claims that Andresen has had his commit access revoked over fears that he has been hacked.
All of this is to say that Wright’s role in the creation of Bitcoin will always be under scrutiny — especially to the extent that he weighs in on the block-size question. Bitcoin’s most avid users, wary of centralized authority and libertarian-leaning in general, are practiced skeptics. As one popular recent Redditor wrote in a DJ Khaled-esque cadence, “Remember: they cannot break bitcoin the tech. They can only try to break bitcoin the community.”
Among other reasons to doubt Wright: Some experts don’t think he’s, well, smart enough to be Nakamoto. “When Mr Wright was outed, experts called his published writings unremarkable,” The Economist writes. They later put it somewhat more delicately: “When interviewed in person, Mr Wright was often hard to follow, but he clearly seemed to know what he was talking about.”
In what is possibly the best use of technology of all time, some genius has invented a machine that cranks out a continuous stream of pancakes.
Excuse me while I book the next flight from New York to South Africa.
A GIF of the machine is making the rounds on Imgur today, but we tracked the original video to a catering company in South Africa that specializes solely in delicious-looking pancakes. The OG video has been viewed more than a million times.
If you haven’t heard of Joanne the Scammer, you have an extremely fun hour or so ahead of you as you search through her Instagram. Joanne Prada, a.k.a. Joanne the Scammer, is the well-known alter ego of Branden Miller, a Florida comedian.
I invented catfishing before Catfish.
The thing is, not to brag, my best friend, Jackie, and I came up with the concept of lying to other people for fun in 2006.
At the time, Facebook had recently started to give access to anyone with any email address — not just the .edu email addresses that marked a person as a college student. Ten years later, from the vantage point of 2016, it’s easy to see this as an inevitable development in Facebook’s world-conquering ambitions. At the time, from the vantage point of a Volkswagen Jetta that smelled like McDonald’s fries, it just seemed annoying. The people we’d gone to high school with didn’t deserve access to Facebook. Access to the college-kid social network was the only thing we had over the pretty, popular girls in the grades below us. And now it was being taken away.
The summer after my freshman year of college, Jackie and I were really bored. Not only were we bored, we were also fat, self-loathing, insecure, and recently dumped by college boyfriends. We were less interested in fixing any of our problems than in wallowing in them, and Jackie and I bonded tremendously over our shared unwillingness to change. We stayed up way past normal human hours and went on 3 a.m. drives to McDonald’s, ordering Big Macs and large fries and Cokes (Diet, of course). We shoplifted bras and bathing suits from the Gap. And we … created a fake “Hot Guy” Facebook profile to mess with our former high school classmates.
In 2010, the filmmaker Nev Schulman documented a journey of discovery — the discovery, to be specific, that the perfect girl he’d met online and fallen in love with was someone else entirely. The movie he made about his experience, Catfish, was later spun off into an MTV show of the same name; since then, “catfishing” has entered the cultural lexicon as an easy shorthand for the all-too-frequent practice of enticing unsuspecting marks by impersonating someone else — or straight-up fabricating an identity — online.
I don’t remember exactly how it happened, or if we really thought through our motivations, but at some point that summer, Jackie and I went to a diner, ordered fried food, and decided, “we should make a fake Facebook profile of a hot guy who will be a senior at our former high school, and fuck with all of those undeserving new Facebook users.”
Using a Yahoo email address we had just made up, we built a profile. Our catfish’s name was Jake Goldman and he was — per the Facebook account we created — going to be a senior at our high school. We found pictures of a guy who looked like the kind of guy that girls across the suburban Northeast are known to fall for. Jake loved lacrosse. Jake loved Family Guy. Jake loved keggers and DMB and the Counting Crows and Phish — “all music but country.” Jake had “never read a book lol,” and Jake loved partying with his boys. Jake was not in a relationship. Jake would be living in the most expensive part of the school district: walking distance to the country club. Jake would be “starting at XY high school and was amped.”
Jake was the most fun Jackie and I had all summer. We put an enormous amount of work into him, tweaking his profile and finding out-of-focus and dark photos of men who could feasibly be Jake. It was an incredible, gleeful rush — the sudden realization that we had at our fingertips the power to create the kind of desirable human being that we ourselves might have pined over. And, in the process, embarrass the girls we resented.
“Heyy jake, welcome to XYHS hehe. they dont have rugby at our school so that kinda sucks but like everyone plays lax.. are you like happy youre moving or pissed,” one girl wrote.
“Not much to do hereeeeee haha, but we do like to party with ourselves,” a more chill girl penned.
“Family Guy is the one show i watch religiously!” Another chimed in.
It’s not that things went according to plan, it’s that things went too according to plan. Within minutes of setting Jake’s profile live and opening our creation for business, girls, girls we knew, were flocking to his page and sending friend requests. We accepted all of them. No one seemed to suspect that Facebook was ripe for this kind of lying and manipulation. The word “thirsty” did not exist in 2006, but it’s the only way to describe what was happening:
Jackie and I spent the rest of that day (and probably the rest of that week, though I can’t remember any of it) dissolved in laughter. We were delighted. We couldn’t believe we got away with it.
And then, well, we got bored. We’d successfully fooled a bunch of girls we disliked, but … why? What their messages showed wasn’t stupidity or vacuity but desperation and desire — the same things we hated about ourselves. Maybe we were the ones who didn’t really deserve Facebook.
I can’t defend any of it, really. Catfishing is, by basically any system of moral judgment, wrong. It’s sociopathic behavior deployed by the damaged. But, well, the thing is: Catfishing helped me confront my self-loathing and overcome some of the most damaged parts of myself. At the time, messing with girls younger than we were was an easy way to feel back on top. We were projecting our own issues out into the world. Insecure, uncomfortable in our new, heavier bodies, we had been dumped for cooler women by guys we assumed would never leave our sides. Putting ourselves in control of a new, desirable, attractive identity gave us a sense of accomplishment and power. But it turned out to be not that much different from our nightly trips to McDonald’s: a quick rush, and then a crash. We could be Jake Goldman on Facebook, but in real life we hadn’t changed anything at all.
I went back to college for sophomore year. Lost weight. Finally got over my ex and, in turn, stopped holding a grudge against him for dumping me. Life went on for all of us. After a few months, when it was clear Jake Goldman had appeared on Facebook, caused a commotion, and was never heard from again, we started telling our friends what we had done and friended all of them under Jake’s name. Soon, Jake’s wall was full of messages from me and Jackie and half of our social circle. One of our friends even used Jake as her stand-in boyfriend when trying to make an ex jealous. Jake was the super-hot guy from home who just never visited or changed his Facebook profile photo. Every October 12, we wished him a happy birthday.
And it wasn’t just girls. From a fellow junior-going-into-senior-year guy: “So wuts up dude, hear ur new, hear u play lax, thats cool, i play lax too. Let me know once u get into town and are settled in and shit and we can go shoot at the field. -peace.”
It’s been ten years since Jackie and I invented Jake Goldman. We can’t remember the password or the email we used to set up shop, and after spending many hours attempting to gain access, we’ve decided to give up. If Jake has survived this long, he deserves to keep on living, if only as an infrequent digital reminder that pretending to be someone else won’t solve all of your problems. But it can get you through a bad summer.
(Names have been changed because I still see some of the people I fooled, and Jackie will kill me if anyone identifies her.)
But it’s hard to fully explain Joanne using words. Watching her is the only way to really get the experience:
But last week the scammer became the scammed, Fusion reports, after someone pretending to be a Twitter employee took control of Miller’s Twitter account and took it offline.
The impostor promised Miller Twitter verification (that highly sought after and deeply misunderstood blue check mark next to certain accounts) if Miller followed their instructions. From there, Miller requested a password-reset code from Twitter (real) and sent that code to the Twitter employee (fake), who promptly locked Miller out of his account.
From Fusion:
It was a shocking turn in the ongoing life of Joanne, but a fittingly poetic one. Miller says he’s working with Twitter to regain control of the account and isn’t worried about the temporary loss: His follower count on Instagram comes in just under 200,000, compared to the few thousand fans he had on Twitter. Joanne will certainly live to scam another day.
Terror struck Twitter this weekend as social-media folk hero Joanne the Scammer suddenly and unexpectedly became Joanne the Scammed.
Over the past five years, Miller’s become an internet phenomenon, racking up hundreds of thousands of followers for his wig-filled videos, tweets, and memes: glimpses at, and advice from, a (fictional) life of stolen credit cards, frivolous lawsuits, and besotted sugar daddies. In the words of Joanne herself: “I just want to let you girls know that I’m a real messy bitch. A liar, a scammer. I love robbery and fraud. A messy bitch who lives for drama.”
This past Sunday marked the fifth anniversary of the special-forces raid that killed Osama bin Laden. And to commemorate (celebrate?) the occasion, the CIA “livetweeted” it:
Sometime in the last half-decade it became conventional wisdom that institutions should have social-media presences. But that’s an idea born out of consulting fees, not wisdom. Not everything needs a Twitter, and especially not the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA doesn’t have page-view targets to meet or customer service to perform. It’s not chatting with friends or following news. It doesn’t even have announcements to make to the public. There is an opportunity for the government to use social media to increase transparency, like San Francisco’s public transit system did back in March. But the CIA has never been and is not currently an organization particularly interested in fully disclosing itself to the public.
Just under two years ago, the CIA launched its Twitter account with a Glomar response. At the time, a spokesperson explained that “The vast majority of our posts are educational – both in tone and content – but we’re attempting to do this in a manner consistent with the culture of these various social media platforms, which includes the occasional light-hearted or humorous posting.”
But no one has been crying out for a lighter-hearted CIA. Neither its critics nor its supporters are interested in a CIA with a sense of humor. Who is thirsting for a CIA spokesperson to joke about Tupac’s death? What does that achieve other than self-created goals about social-media engagement? Why does the government agency responsible for botched coups and installing brutal dictatorships need to have a human(ish) presence? The answer: It doesn’t — the CIA’s Twitter both de-emphasizes the seriousness of the agency’s work and underestimates its audience’s tolerance for disingenuous PR moves. The best way for the CIA to be consistent with the culture of Twitter would be for it to delete its account.
The community surrounding popular e-sport (pronounced “video game”) League of Legends is embroiled in a minor scandal after Riot, the developer overseeing the game, banned a popular streamer by the name of Tyler1. And if you don’t think that Tyler Was Permanently Banned From a Video Game is important news, well, check your Facebook trending topics.
The community as a whole seems split: some thankful that Riot appears to be paying attention to the troll problems, others angry at the perceived hypocrisy, and, because this is gaming, a large and supportive group cheering Tyler on. If you’re not versed in League of Legends jargon, the discussion over Tyler’s ban can be thrillingly incomprehensible. The impenetrable gibberish and highly developed jargon references tactics — “jungling,” “ganking,” etc. — specific to the MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) genre. You could try to understand it, or you could enjoy the Clockwork Orange-ness of the invented language:
Monday night’s Met Gala was a stunning affair, with high society’s hottest movers and shakers showing off their fancy clothes. The theme was Manus x Machina, highlighting the intersection of fashion, technology, and culture, at the junction of fabric and silicon, where the gigabits meet the sewing kits.
What a night! It’s tough to pick a favorite look, but Orlando Bloom and girlfriend Katy Perry certainly impressed with their matching Tamagotchis. Remember the ‘90s? Orlando Bloom certainly does.
The detail on Bloom’s svelte red tuxedo was immaculate. I mean, look at this dude!
Let’s zoom in on some of the detail.
Now let’s enhance.
Congratulations on a stunning gala, Orlando! I hope your Tamagotchi is not drowning in feces.

“I don’t regret what I snapped, because everybody is saying how bold and funny it was, but it definitely made me look a little desperate,” Abby told me. “But I don’t care, because obviously now I’m here.” Abby’s sent many snaps to the UW campus story in the past but says she’d never been featured prior to going viral.
If you haven’t, here’s the tl;dr version: Last Thursday night, a female student dubbed “Mystery Girl” declared her “love” for fellow student “Vikings Fan” on the UW Snapchat story (a public aggregation of snaps from students).
Until now, the pair were known only by their Snapchat monikers “Mystery Girl” and “Vikings Fan.” But after a little internet sleuthing (read: Facebook stalking), we tracked the couple down. Both are 22-year-old seniors at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and, for privacy, have asked to be referred to only by their first names: Abby and Reed.
Meanwhile, Reed was working on a class project when a friend texted him to say that a girl had “called him out” on Snapchat.
For Abby and Reed, the best part was watching the snaps from other UW students cheering them on in their attempts to meet. “The two lonely guys” — a pair of students who submitted several snaps about their own romantic problems to the “HELP VIKINGS FAN FIND MYSTERY GIRL” story — “sitting on the couch were literally the MVPs of the story. I don’t even care that they tried to steal our thunder, because I thought it was hysterical,” Abby said.
Despite the campus camaraderie, the two almost missed each other. By the time Reed showed up to the KK, the campus bar Abby told him she’d be at, Abby had already left. (In Reed’s defense, he was working on that class project until 1 a.m.)
“The KK was closing up when he finally got there, so the doors to get in were locked, and I couldn’t get back in. I actually had to sneak through the exit door,” Abby said. “Usually, if you do that the bouncer throws you out.”
“I was thinking some girl was throwing hate at the Vikings or something, and I went on there ready to fire right back,” Reed told me when we spoke on the phone Monday.
“It was, um, pretty emotional,” Reed said.
After that, Reed “got her number and walked her home” and the two have spent “every day-ish together” since, though they explicitly told me they are “definitely not dating.” Activities have included watching “some stupid scary movie,” baking brownies, and attending a block party in downtown Madison.
So, was it staged? Abby and Reed both swore to me that their Snapchat meet-cute was fate and not a fake. “This was 100 percent legit,” Reed told me. “Some place came out with an article that said we were models paid by Snapchat. That’s just absurd.”
When the two finally met, Abby and Reed ran into each other’s arms for a long embrace — documented entirely on Snapchat, of course. (Isn’t 2016 fun?)
“I told Reed to wear the Vikings jersey just for shits and giggles, because I didn’t think people would recognize us [at the party] unless he wore it,” Abby explained. “That was probably a bad move. We got there and within 45 seconds we were completely mobbed and had to leave.”
“I almost didn’t let go,” Abby added.
“If you look on Facebook, we only became friends yesterday,” Abby explained. “We just added each other on Snapchat. We have all the evidence to prove this is real.”
YouTube star Colin Furze created a homemade flying contraption that’s equal parts awesome and terrifying.
Mystery Girl told Vikings Fan to come find her, and the pair, in classic romantic-comedy fashion, tried and failed to meet up several times. Also in classic romantic-comedy fashion, their classmates started rooting for them, and Snapchat created a “HELP VIKINGS FAN FIND MYSTERY GIRL” photo filter, adding to the mania. Finally, after hours (which in Snapchat time is years, if not decades) of missed connections, the two met up in a campus bar and lived happily ever after. (You can read our initial coverage here, or watch the short video from The Tab below.)
Abby, a.k.a. “Mystery Girl,” is majoring in zoology and environmental studies, and contemplating a move to Florida after graduation (“I just love the sun”). And Reed, a.k.a. “Vikings Fan,” is a biomedical-engineering student with his sights set on med school.
Finally, a solution to all those times you’ve wanted to eat an ear of corn and thought Nah, this’ll take too long.
The grandiose Australian computer scientist Craig Wright, who yesterday announced to the world in a coordinated media campaign that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of Bitcoin, said today that he will move some of the Bitcoin known to belong to Nakamoto “in the coming days.” He had better, because the evidence he has proffered so far is not at all convincing.
The video only has a few hundred views on YouTube right now, but it’s quickly climbing the /r/videos subreddit. “I wonder how many of those ‘kernels’ flying at the camera were actually teeth,” commented one Redditor.
Vitalik Buterin, a Bitcoin expert and founder of Ethereum, put the matter this way at yesterday’s Consensus conference, in New York:
To continue our mailbox metaphor, Wright basically produced an envelope with Satoshi’s address on it, only for experts to discover and announce that the envelope was simply a copy of one already taken out of the mailbox in 2009. As another expert noted, switching metaphorical gears entirely, the blog post “proof” is like a thief producing a photocopy of your signature and claiming it as his own. The deception really is this obvious. And in the few hours since the announcement was made, the consensus of the Bitcoin community has grown very rapidly against Wright’s claims. “This is the Canadian girlfriend of cryptographic signatures,” observed one Redditor.
I will explain why I think he’s probably not Satoshi [applause] He had the opportunity to take two different paths of proving this. One path would have been to make this exact proof, make a signature from the first bitcoin block, put the signature out in public […] he would let the crypto community verify this. But instead he has written a huge blog post that is long and confusing and it has bugs in the software and he also says he won’t release the evidence. Signaling theory says that if you have a good way to prove something and you have a noisy way to do it, then the reason why you picked the noisy way was because you couldn’t do it the good way in the first place.
(The Economist, among all the press organizations involved in this case, is to be commended for asking all the right questions, and for refusing to take what now appears to have been the spurious bait.)
Had Wright really been Satoshi, it seems altogether likely that he would simply have used the method Buterin suggests, mailed himself his own brand-new envelope, if you will, and removed it from the mailbox in full view of the public — which can be done instantly, anonymously, and free of cost using Bitcoin. Had he done that, we wouldn’t even be having this discussion. From the start it would have been clear as day that this was the guy. Instead, security expert Dan Kaminsky yesterday characterized Wright’s proofs as “intentional scammery.”
As a longtime Bitcoin watcher, I consider that Wright’s failure to conduct the obvious demonstration is the most damning strike against him. But running a close second to that failure is his consistent inability to string together a tolerably clear English sentence. The real Satoshi Nakamoto is a calm, educated, articulate man. Craig Wright is by comparison a self-consequential, illiterate blowhard; his writing is imprecise and clumsy, full of misspellings and primitive solecisms never committed by the real Satoshi. If he is not the guy, then why the scammery?
I’ve met Gavin Andresen in person, and spoken and corresponded with him at length, and until yesterday morning I would have told you that his word on this matter was law. But certain developments have altered Andresen’s position in the Bitcoin world. He has been stripped of “commit access” to Bitcoin Core, which is to say, the right to alter the original version of Bitcoin’s code without permission from the other current “core devs,” all of whom he appointed himself. Andresen began mastering, maintaining, and protecting this code with the real Satoshi in 2009; he shepherded it through thick and thin, through near-fatal bugs, exchange crashes, and government bans, through the massive runup in the currency’s value in late 2013, and its waxing and waning since. Throughout, he has been a model of mild, level-headed probity, in sharp contrast to the pompous libertarian kooks often found in the Bitcoin world.
Whatever else may have happened, this is a palace coup, pure and simple, likely connected to the deep fracture in the Bitcoin developers’ community with respect to future growth: The furious debate around “block size” in particular can be seen as an attempt to effectively privatize Bitcoin. Some of the remaining core developers are involved in a a startup called Blockstream, a company that will likely benefit if Andresen’s long-sought recommendation to increase block size is not followed. When I asked Andresen, was your commit access really revoked? How, and by whom? He replied: “Yes, by Wladimir [van der Laan], by poking some buttons at github.” So far, he has declined to say more than this.
Without a doubt there are powerful commercial impulses at work in the Bitcoin world, notably those connected with Blockstream; the fate of this commercial enterprise might very easily be involved in the Craig Wright circus, as various observers on Reddit and elsewhere have noted. Was Gavin Andresen’s agreement to identify Craig Wright as Satoshi connected in some way to his fate as a Bitcoin core developer, and if so, how?
Andresen’s involvement aside, interesting as it is, The Economist demanded yesterday that Wright produce new proofs of his control of the private keys involved in the London “demonstrations.” This is the best place to look for further corroboration — or otherwise — of Craig Wright’s claims. His refusal to comply with these requests so far speaks volumes.
Unfortunately for Wright, however, the sages of Hacker News, Reddit, and the Bitcoin forums weren’t about to take that assertion on faith, and within hours they’d discovered that the “proof” Wright offered had simply been copied from an early, genuine transaction of Satoshi’s on the Bitcoin ledger. (Which is the nice thing about having complete, unfalsifiable records!) Rather than encrypt the Sartre passage using Satoshi’s private key, thus demonstrating he had it, Wright had merely fiddled with a bitcoin transaction signed with that key from 2009. Patrick McKenzie, patio11 on github, has a particularly clear explanation of Wright’s deception. It’s clever, but, McKenzie says (and I believe him) that he too could have fooled a non-crypto-expert in a similar manner, with a couple of hours’ preparation. Other experts weighed in on the obvious hoax here, here, here, here, and here.
But the additional proof of his identity offered online by Wright yesterday morning began immediately to crumble, and was reduced to powder in a matter of hours, throwing even the testimony of Gavin Andresen into doubt.
Both Matonis and Andresen apparently traveled to London to meet Wright in recent weeks, along with various members of the press; Wright submitted himself to some of their questions, and reportedly demonstrated that he could sign a message of Andresen’s choosing — “Gavin’s favorite number is eleven” — using a key known to have belonged to the real Nakamoto. One of Bitcoin’s most useful features is a complete, irrefutable public ledger of every transaction that’s ever occurred since the currency’s launch, in January of 2009, so a number of Nakamoto’s Bitcoin addresses are known, since he was the first person to use the system.
In order to prove his identity, then, Satoshi Nakamoto would need to transfer some of the early bitcoins we know belong to him, or sign a message using the private key to one or more of those bitcoins. If we were to extend the mailbox metaphor, we might say that he’d need to show us mail that we knew to have been in the mailbox, whether because its existence has been public and known, or because we’d sent it to him.
And here the trouble begins. For in addition to providing private proofs that convinced two very credible Bitcoin experts — Andresen, in particular, being known as a very straight shooter — Wright published a long, ill-written, confusing blog post in which he demonstrated his control over one of Satoshi’s private keys by providing putative evidence that he’d used this key to “sign” a passage written by Jean-Paul Sartre.
For the purposes of this discussion, an easy way to think of Bitcoin’s public-key encryption is that a public key is like a mailbox at the post office: Anyone can know where your personal mailbox is, but only you can open it, with your own private key. Similarly, anybody could know of Bitcoin addresses and public keys belonging to the real Satoshi Nakamoto, but only he (or a beneficiary, or a thief) has the private keys that could be used to transfer a bit of his known stash of a million or so bitcoins, or to sign an encrypted message.
Wright spoke with three media outlets for stories published yesterday, but the most salient new point in favor of his contention is that Gavin Andresen, for many years Bitcoin’s lead programmer, and one of the few people on Earth known to have corresponded with the true inventor of Bitcoin (though they never met face to face) professed himself convinced that Wright is the real deal. Likewise John Matonis, a founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation, is 100-percent persuaded of the authenticity of Wright’s claims. Matonis sent out an email on Monday morning to various journalists interested in Bitcoin, with the subject line “HOW I MET SATOSHI,” underscoring his conviction: “I have no doubt that Craig Steven Wright is the person behind the Bitcoin technology.”
All you need, as demonstrated by one brave guy on the internet, is a power drill and teeth of steel. Voilà! What a time-saver!
Ew.
Netflix knows how to suck you in and keep your attention. Not just in the sense that it’s easy to suddenly find yourself two days and four seasons deep into Grey’s Anatomy without any warning: The streaming company has also figured out exactly what gets you to click on a title in the first place.
Last week, Apple ended its period of record growth with a down quarter, causing an eight-day downslide. For Apple — whose stock last fell for eight days in a row in 1998 — that’s something approaching a crisis, and yesterday CEO Tim Cook went on CNBC to run damage control.
Cook blamed the drop on an abnormally high number of phone upgrades during the year prior, but said that customer loyalty had never been better. Services (like iCloud and music streaming) are now the company’s second-largest source of revenue behind hardware, and they’re growing.
To be clear, Apple is not doomed — at least, not for a very long time. Wall Street investors might not be able to use Apple to accrue wealth as quickly as they once did (their definition of “doom”), but the company has hundreds of billions of dollars in assets and a pretty decent foothold in the smartphone market. (You may have heard of its “iPhone” product.)
Cook also took issue with the assertion that the Apple Watch was a flop: “In a few years we will look back and people will say ‘How could I ever have thought about not wearing this watch?’, because it will be doing so much for you.” A few years is probably more than some investors are willing to wait.
“We’re still in learning mode,” he admitted. “We’re learning fairly quickly though.”
But Cook offered little information about the future other than hyperbolic platitudes. He literally said, “We’re incredibly excited about things we’re working on. I don’t want to be more specific than that.” Wow, Tim, can you please leave us a little bit of mystery?
Unsurprisingly, that choice is almost entirely dictated by a movie or show’s thumbnail image, rather than its title. From a Netflix blog post via Fast Company:
Finally, pictures of polarizing characters, especially bad guys and villains, get better engagement. This is particularly true of kids’ and action movies — though it also helps to explain the House of Cards ad campaign.
Is the incessant bleeping of an alarm no longer enough to rouse you in the A.M.? That’s cool, because now you can just shock yourself awake.

People respond better to images with people in them — as long as there aren’t too many people. Images with three (or fewer) people perform better than their more crowded counterparts, Netflix explains in this blog post.
Once you’ve decided on a main character (or two) to show off, the next question is: What is he or she doing? People showing “complex emotions” are more likely to draw viewers. “Complex” in this case really just means “not stoic or neutral” — like Ellie Kemper’s doofy face in the bottom right thumbnail for Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.
Based on these findings, I’ve analyzed Netflix in a highly scientific manner to determine that this picture — with its perfect combination of no more than three polarizing figures demonstrating complex emotion — must be the most effective Netflix thumbnail of all time.
A great many wonderful things have come about thanks to consumer-level 3D printing — toys, prosthetic limbs, detailed models (and guns). But as web scenes grow larger, they can grow weirder, too. Case in point: the community on 3D-printing design database Thingiverse, which is currently grappling with Shiv Integer, a bot that combines other schematics into useless, Dalí-like contraptions.
Shiv Integer is an automated program created by two artists, Matthew Plummer-Fernandez and Julien Deswaef, which takes other designs on the sites and mashes them together. (According to the artist’s FAQ, the program respects the usage-rights settings on designs, only pulling from the ones with the correct permissions.) The objects are printable but useless.
This includes designs like the Cup strapped to Weekly OK, left, and the Customizable Clip station.
All of this has led Thingiverse to many questions with no clear answer. Can automated programs create art? Can they have intention? Is the meta discussion happening itself part of the piece?
It reads, “Someone may not like your contributions to Thingiverse either; can we still respect each other and share this platform? Please do not resort to insults. You may also learn to like it; the best art challenges your views.”
A Finnish 10-year-old named Jani is officially the youngest person Facebook has paid through their Bug Bounty Program (a rewards program that pays people to find problems and weaknesses in Facebook’s code), usurping the title previously held by a 13-year-old.
Total number of my friends with accounts: five, including one of the kids I teach computer programming to at the local high school.
Ello was a wonderful idea, conceptually: A clean, ad-free social network that you could browse without shame or weird right-wing shares from your aunt. How would the company make money? By selling T-shirts! Hmm. Making Ello invite-only at launch resulted in a population of Tumblr-burnished hipsters eager to peacock their impeccable taste in GIFs. The network is still allegedly in beta, but all of the excitement around Ello has faded away.
Of all the people I know who had installed Shots, none of them had posted more than five pictures to the account. Most only had one: an unflattering selfie, presented without comment. This includes Riff Raff.
And then: access. When you sign in to Makeoutclub, it gives you a little tally of who’s online. At no point during my time on the site did this exceed five people, including me. This tally also included the site’s administrators. As befits its Web-1.0 pedigree, the majority of content on Makeoutclub is on “The Board,” a free-ranging discussion forum. The “what music are you listening to” topic is the most active (Lil Ugly Mane, Animal Collective), but for my money the most fascinating thing I found was a thread titled “I met someone on makeoutclub 13 years ago and I have an 11 year old son because of it!”
Yo
After the initial wave of novelty blog headlines wore off, developer Or Arbel tried to beef up the Yo-verse with location capability, photos, and groups, but by this point it was already yesterday’s news. In the summer of 2014 the BBC reported that Israelis were using it to warn each other of inbound missile attacks.
Give the industry credit: Everybody realized Yo was idiotic the moment it launched. That didn’t stop it from getting $2.5 million in funding in 2014. The premise is simple: Press a friend’s name to send them the word “Yo” as a notification. And … nothing else. Well, sure, they can Yo you back if they are so inclined, but that’s it.
Total number of friends with accounts: zero.
Yo now has accounts you can “subscribe to” within the app, like “YoZinger” that promises you “a Yo every time a candidate drops a zinger during the GOP debate.” The screen with these apps has a rotating banner ad on the top that features Sony Pictures, TechCrunch, and the Chelsea football club, all of whom apparently can’t wait to Yo you.
Since I don’t have any friends still using Yo and the app has no public feed, I was forced to send my wife an unsolicited Yo and see what happened. There is literally no greater crime in the modern era than sending someone an unwanted invitation to a virtually defunct social network. You’re basically saying “Hey, I want to crap up your phone and take away valuable memory for something you’ll never use. Hope you like push notifications!”
My wife, on the other hand, didn’t bother to Yo me back.
That means $10,000 for proving he could successfully delete comments from other Instagram users (that included Justin Bieber, Jani told Iltalehti, as translated by Forbes.) The glitch has since been repaired, a Facebook rep also told Forbes.
It’s worth noting that at 10, Jani is technically not old enough to use Facebook or Instagram, as per each company’s terms of service. (Minimum user age for both platforms is 13.)
Jani says his plans for his windfall include purchasing a football and a bicycle. It’s good to know what you want.
For more than a year, Facebook’s trending topics — that list of short news blurbs in the upper-right corner of the Facebook home page — have kept users in the know, delivering stories about the latest objects of viral interest in a bizarre, clinical tone, as if they’d been written by someone minutes after being thawed from a decadelong cryosleep. Maybe you’ve seen the recent news item about Justin Bieber (“Singer Responds to People Who Have Criticized His Hair”) or the one about Air Jordans (“Photo Shows Sneakers Featuring Meme of Michael Jordan Crying During Speech”).
Okay, adults, gather ‘round and listen closely. I am going to teach you how to build the internet’s wettest meme: the Bath Bomb.
Step one: Pick an object. (Any object: An iPod. Slices of American cheese. A bonsai tree. The urn holding your dead aunt Rose. Anything.)
Step two: Fill your bathtub with water and say, “I love my Lush bath bomb.”
Step three: Throw whatever piece of crap you’ve selected into the tub.
A brief explanation: In late 2014, according to the authoritative Know Your Meme, people on Tumblr got in the habit of posting pictures and videos of themselves throwing Lush bath bombs (scented soaplike products that turn your water fizzy) into their tubs. Because this was Tumblr, the obstinately weird parodies were only a few steps behind. The Bath Bomb meme has been simmering for the last year, only to, for whatever reason, explode over the last week or so.
Congratulations: You have officially made yourself a bath bomb. In case you’re still lacking for inspiration or not getting the joke (Mom), here are a few more choice examples.
A Jesus bath bomb.
A tree bath bomb.
Ramen bath bomb. Are you getting it now?
Please bomb responsibly.
Exactly how these blurbs are created has been shrouded in mystery, but Gizmodo’s Michael Nuñez, in the latest of a string of Facebook scoops, has tracked down the people who are tasked with sorting through and writing them. Things appear … grim. Hired in a freelance capacity through a string of subcontractors, the news-curation team is tasked with reading and summarizing dozens of stories every day. According to the report, “Managers gave curators aggressive quotas for how many summaries and headlines to write, and timed how long it took curators to write a post. The general standard was 20 posts a day.”
Facebook’s news curation, as well as their M messenger-bot and God knows what else, tend to present a kind of bland algorithmic face that hides actual human beings sitting and typing at desks around the world, often under terrible working conditions. In this case, humans are being tasked to ensure that what is presented as a straightforward, algorithmically determined picture of the site’s most popular topics of discussion doesn’t embarrass or otherwise damage Facebook.
This is because some of the things that trend on Facebook might make the company look very bad, or, at the very least, stupid. Facebook doesn’t want — for example — ”Obama Birth Certificate” or “Chemtrails” to show up as trending topics, because to publicly acknowledge the frequency with which those subjects are discussed would be to accept some level of responsibility for them. (Declaring something a “trending topic,” after all, only makes it trend more.)
And, so, maybe unsurprisingly, the main function of the curators is to temper the wild swings of virality. Curators were allowed to blacklist trending topics, and did so on a daily basis. “A topic was often blacklisted if it didn’t have at least three traditional news sources covering it,” Nuñez writes, “but otherwise the protocol was murky[.]” At the same time, certain news sources were to be avoided, “Twitter” was to be replaced with the more generic “social media,” and only Facebook-native video was to be promoted:
As the Times’s John Herrman points out, that line about the Blaze and Breitbart — both right-wing news sources — will probably haunt Facebook for a while. Anyone can now cry censorship whenever they see a dip in Facebook referrals or the absence of a trending topic like “Benghazi.”
And that’s going to be a pain for Facebook. The success of platforms often rests on their ability to present themselves as neutral spaces. (Look at the outcry when Twitter introduced an algorithmically sorted timeline in place of its reverse-chronological feed.) Facebook wants us to think of its products as transparent and objective: perfect robotic helpmates. But of course, there’s always a human behind the scenes somewhere — not just because the bots and algorithms aren’t advanced enough, but because objectivity and neutrality often come into conflict with the overall interests of the platform.
How many times in your life have you been asked the question “Did you unplug your router and plug it back in again?” How many times have you been forced to get up from the couch to unplug your router when your internet fizzles out? ResetPlug, spotted by Paul Miller at the Verge’s new CircuitBreaker gadget blog, is a pricey solution to this particular crisis of modern life.
The device connects to your router and/or modem and monitors your Wi-Fi connection. If there’s a disconnect, ResetPlug will, you know, reset your connection once every five minutes until you’re back online.
In other words: You won’t have to part with your couch or chair, climb up the stairs out of your parents’ basement, and unplug the modem to reset your Wi-Fi anymore. ResetPlug will do that for you.
Priced at $60, the gadget doesn’t come cheap. (And you might be better served just upgrading your Wi-Fi router.) But depending on how frequently your Wi-Fi fizzles out (or how buried in a junk drawer your router is), it might be worth the investment. You can order one here.
As someone who has been in the workforce for approximately three weeks, I am very qualified to give the following advice: Don’t fall asleep at work. And in case that’s not enough to compel you to stay awake, just ask this intern at ad agency iris Worldwide in Atlanta, who nodded off Tuesday afternoon and awoke to find himself the subject of an office Photoshop battle.
One of his co-workers shared the edited nap pictures on Reddit, which was where we spotted them.
Luckily for the intern, nobody at the office seemed to be too miffed by his mid-afternoon snooze.
“Our team doesn’t typically fall asleep on the job, but our office does have a lot of comfortable seating options and we occasionally play some Enya, so it was bound to happen eventually,” the co-worker told me, via email.
“It all happened within about ten minutes,” his co-worker also said. “Everyone was enjoying the break in the grind for a good laugh.”
He makes a pretty compelling Leia.
Still, this isn’t the first time a conked-out intern has become fodder for the internet (remember this guy?). Interns, take note, and maybe order yourself an extra latte on the next coffee run you are forced to make.
For all intents and purposes, as of last night, Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president. A lot has already been written — and a lot more will be written — about how an erratic businessman with no political experience, receiving strong opposition from the party Establishment, was able to pull off such a sudden and unexpected coup. (One obvious and correct answer is that a white, male billionaire, with decades of media exposure and brand recognition, would never have had a particularly steep hill to climb.) But part of the story is that the internet is changing the political process in America. And Trump is, so far, the man who’s best managed to take advantage of it.
A few months ago, the journalism professor Clay Shirky laid out, in a series of tweets, a loose theory of the last half-century of media evolution, specifically as it’s reflected in party politics. It’s worth reading in full, but his central idea is this: “Politically acceptable discourse is limited by supply, not demand. The public is hungry for more than politicians are willing to discuss.” In other words, there are sizable constituencies in the U.S. for various kinds of “politically unacceptable” rhetoric and ideas — from violent nativism to Nordic-style socialism — that have generally remained untapped because access has been mediated by a relatively small number of institutional media gatekeepers.
Until recently. The national arrival of cable television in the 1980s, the internet in the 2000s, and social media in the 2010s, has, Shirky writes, hugely diminished “[t]he ability of elites to determine the outside edges of acceptable conversation.”
No longer do (usually) rich, white, male, pro-business executives, party officials, and editors enforce the boundaries of discourse. Where those boundaries were arbitrary, stupid, and ignorant, this is an unambiguously good thing. Where those boundaries also included an at-least vague relationship to truth and reality, their erasure is a little more complicated.
That’s how we get Trump, a candidate who spent this week theorizing that another candidate’s father had participated in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. It doesn’t matter how negatively or derisively the New York Times and the Washington Post cover the quest to prove that President Obama isn’t American, or even if they don’t cover it at all. A birther candidate can still reach his constituency directly.
If Trump is particularly well-positioned to take advantage of a new-media environment, it’s in part because he seems to embody it. One of Trump’s many striking aspects is that he speaks offline in the cadence of online discussion: raw, unfiltered, off-the-cuff. When discussing things with friends on Facebook or in Slack, or wherever you may be, the standard for truth, accuracy, and political correctness is lower. People share fake, problematic stuff online all the time. The general tenor of these posts is something like, “I don’t usually share things like this but it makes you think!”
This is how Trump talks: Worth is judged by its relationship to feeling, not reality. The truth is beside the point — the share generates conversation and attention, the true currency of the digital age. A popular running joke is that Trump embodies the most racist, sexist, and vitriolic aspects of a YouTube comments section, which is true but also not quite right. Trump doesn’t exactly talk like he’s commenting on YouTube. He talks like he’s sharing stuff to Facebook. “Did you see this? Pretty interesting!” If it turns out to be fake, so be it. It feels right.
Since the 1960s, a fundamental rule guiding the technology industry, first observed by Intel founder Gordon Moore, has remained stable: The number of transistors that can be placed on a microchip doubles every year. In 1975, Moore’s Law, as it came to be known, was revised to hold that the number of transistors doubled every two years.
The effect of Moore’s Law (which is not an actual scientific law) was that it allowed the computer industry to forecast the capabilities of future machines accurately, and it helped component manufacturers to set goals and benchmarks, as well. As the New York Times put it, Moore’s Law “describes the pace of change in a manufacturing process that has made computers exponentially more affordable.”
But Moore’s Law, which is tied to the physical components that make computing possible, has its limits. From the Times:
In other words, this guiding principle states that computers get more powerful because physical components get smaller. Unfortunately, things can only get so small (this is, more or less, an actual scientific law), meaning that chip makers now have to find totally new ways of increasing computing power beside cramming more transistors onto a piece of silicon. (Admittedly, an oversimplification of what chip makers do.)
To that end, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the leading tech-engineering organization, will announce a new road map today, broader than the one set out by Moore’s Law. The International Roadmap for Devices and Systems will also track other types of computer technologies, such as quantum computing.
There are some holdouts. Intel seems to think that Moore’s Law will continue to hold for a bit longer. “I have witnessed the advertised death of Moore’s Law no less than four times,” CEO Brian Krzanich wrote last month. But the IEEE’s move points to increasing anxiety about the physical limits on our digital age — and nothing breeds ingenuity like the impending collapse of a central rule of technology. The bright side for users is that huge innovations are no longer a luxury for tech makers; soon, they’ll be a necessity.
Moore’s Law dictates why the smartphone in your pocket is more powerful than the Gateway you were using at the turn of the century. It’s why companies like Apple and Samsung can release new iPhone and Galaxy models every year with significant boosts in performance and speed. If the pace set by Moore’s Law were to become unattainable, then your computers and phones might, hypothetically, plateau in terms of performance.
According to a new transparency report from the United States’ intelligence community, warrantless searches on Americans’ data doubled between 2013 and 2015. The National Security Agency’s database, collected under section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, features millions of digital communications collected from major internet platforms like Google and Facebook.
From the Intercept:
In 2013, the NSA had asked for 198 searches of American communications, while the CIA requested roughly 1,900. In addition, 2015 saw 23,800 queries for metadata surrounding communications by Americans, up from approximately 9,500 in 2013.
Of course, you won’t find such blunt language in the report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which features graphics like this:
That’s pretty obtuse language for a data-collection scheme that claims to operate within legal limits! Just my take.
As the Intercept also points out, the stats don’t include any communications searches conducted by the FBI, which uses the NSA database to search for crimes not just related to national security or terrorism, but more traditional crimes as well.
Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez broke up (for the gazillionth and final time) back in 2014. But it was the great romance of our age, and many, many people are still pining for their love. Like … 3.6 million people.
Six weeks ago, Bieber posted this blurry photo of the pair kissing in a pool with the caption “Feels.” Since then, more than 3.5 million people (quickly approaching 3.6) have liked the photo, making it the most-liked photo on Instagram, as BuzzFeed points out.
Bieber’s pool pic usurps Kendall Jenner’s now infamous heart-hair Instagram for the top spot. Back in 2015, Jenner’s picture was the most-liked shot on the app for the entire year (as well as on the app in general).
Sorry, Kendall. Maybe try something a little blurrier next time.
This Batmobile-inspired creation is causing quite a stir among auto geeks, and we can see why.

Hulu confirmed this week that it’s working on offering customers a live television package later this year — one that would allow viewers to watch television as it airs rather than having to wait for it to show up online the next day. The announcement came during Newfronts, the internet’s version of upfronts, where digital media organizations beg — I’m sorry, pitch — advertisers for the coming season. And Hulu might not be the only one: A report from Bloomberg earlier today claims that YouTube is working on a similar live option.
Both programs are in the preliminary stages, meaning that agreements with different television networks are still being hammered out. YouTube has reportedly approached Comcast (which owns NBC), Viacom, Fox, and CBS, but has not yet reached an agreement with anyone. Similarly, Hulu has nothing in place but has reportedly spoken with Fox and Disney (ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel).
Hulu’s live package and YouTube Unplugged, as the service is being referred to, won’t be here anytime soon, maybe in the fall at the earliest. Networks that rake in millions via cable bundling have been slow to cede territory to the internet, but it is happening, especially as they watch viewers move to streaming services and social networks. Dish Network’s Sling and PlayStation Vue are already out there, but more competition could certainly help convince traditional TV broadcasters to pick up the pace.
Sanders says she’s been overwhelmed by the number of people who have told her that she “made them more comfortable with their amputation.”
Laura Hajek, a musician and actor better known as Edith Pop to her nearly 20,000 Instagram followers, has tried everything to get more likes on her posts over the last four years. She’s re-timed her posts after reading about what hours are best to publish photos. She’s studied how filters affect likes. (The Mayfair filter seems to garner more.) She’s put popular hashtags on photos (#brooklyn and #music). At one point, she even paid for an app that encourages users to like one another’s images.
As with anything suddenly and accidentally viral, the couple has also encountered trolls: “One gal commented, ‘this is stupid as shit.’ But what’s funny is, that stuff doesn’t affect me in the least,” Libby said. “I have such a strong, wonderful marriage and this comment only made me smile.”
But in the past year or so, she’s found herself putting less effort into bolstering ‘likes,’ after seeing a major shift in what she calls the “‘like’ exchange rate.” Many users, especially younger fans of hers, scroll through their feeds liking nearly every post. With many people handing out likes indiscriminately, or in hopes of receiving likes back, she has seen more engagement but it doesn’t feel genuine. “The value of a ‘like’ is definitely decreasing — there is less thought involved,” she said. “Nowadays, a ‘like’ says more ‘information received’ or ‘I saw this’ than ‘I like this.’ I’ve been getting more likes on Instagram, but it just seems like the pool of people is larger and they are liking posts more, not that they actually like me or my work.”
For years, the “like” (or, in some places, the “fav”) has been the basic unit of currency on social media: the easy, universal measure of a post or poster’s quality, popularity, and power. But its dominant position atop the default methods of engagement in social media is increasingly challenged, as Facebook expands its array of reactions and the market becomes flooded with spammers and scammers. The like doesn’t mean what it used to — not just to people looking for easy validation, but to brands and companies looking for popular, high-engagement accounts.
Look no further than the comments on the Instagram account of any member of the Kardashian clan, particularly the Jenner sisters, to witness rampant like inflation in action. There, hundreds of thousands of users — mostly teens — take part in a fast-paced trade system meant to increase the number of likes on their photos and videos. Countless “lb” (like back), “first,” and “row for row” comments outpace genuine feedback on the photos, marking social media contracts promising to like a user’s photo or first row of photos in exchange for likes on posts of their own.
Companies that advertise on Instagram seem to be finding ways around fake likes and followers — and with some bloggers making $5,000 to $10,000 just to mention a brand in a post, it’s in sponsors’ best interest to ensure their followers and likes are legit. Alexandra Tweten, the woman behind popular Instagram account @ByeFelipe said follower count and likes per post are good indicators of a popular account, but not the only metrics brands look at now.
“The demand for these accounts, coupled with the relative ease of creating them, have created a large underground market for fake accounts, fake followers, and fake likes,” Patrick Murray, vice president of products at DataVisor, a company that tracks bots like these, told me by email. “These cyber attackers have become increasingly hard to distinguish from legitimate users.”
This concept isn’t new — it dates back to the days of Myspace, when users would leave “pic4pic” comments to artificially boost engagement. But today, the systemic “lbs” carried out on a mass scale by teens and paid bots that, for as little is $1, will “like” thousands of posts, have driven the value of a single like down to near irrelevancy.
“A lot of sponsors look at followers, but they are starting to look more at engagement as well, like how many genuine comments you get,” she said.
Tweten has also found sponsors are avoiding relying on likes and followers as engagement metrics altogether, shifting to a revenue-share model in which users get paid for the number of people who actually sign up for the product through the account. (Tweten’s account, which chronicles the rude and threatening messages women get after rejecting men on dating apps, has nearly 400,000 followers, but gets half the likes on posts as do popular fashion bloggers with similar followings.)
And if brands can no longer count on likes as indicators of true engagement, you can bet the metric has long fallen out of favor with the true arbiters of What Is Cool on the internet: teens. As a recent episode of This American Life chronicling the labyrinthian social norms of teen girls on Instagram showed, many young Instagram users mindlessly ‘like’ every post in their feed, giving no thought to whether they actually like it. With this in mind, according to my sister, a Very Cool Teen, teens are coming up with their own ways to determine what matters on Instagram.
“Likes aren’t dead yet, but it’s more about ratios now,” she told me. “The like-to-minute ratio is a big thing, like, if you posted a picture five minutes ago and you already have 60 likes people will comment ‘whoa, that ratio!’ Like-to-follower ratio is also huge. If you have 600 likes and only 1,000 followers it shows how many real followers you have.”
Many teens will send a group text to their closest friends before posting a photo on Instagram or immediately after it’s up alerting them all to like it (“peep the insta” is a common request). However, practices like these may not stick around for long, as Instagram is following Facebook’s lead and switching to an algorithmic feed, which will prioritize the accounts users interact with the most. Soon, you may automatically see your closest friends’ posts at the top of your feed.
This announcement came to the dismay of hundreds of thousands of artists who came together to demand it remain chronological, arguing smaller users will be hurt when their posts are pushed out of the top feed. Like Facebook users manipulating the newly changed algorithm for traffic, Laura Hajek now worries she will have to find a new way to trick the app into making her posts more visible and continue to promote her content.
“I wonder how it’s going to work when you post something new, how much time do they give you to get your like count up before they hide your photo forever?” she said.
“She told me how odd it is to not have a pinky and she looked a little disappointed,” Libby’s husband, Matt, told me about the now-viral moment. “I didn’t think about it, I just wanted to make her happy, so I offered up mine in its place.”
Earlier this week, nurse Libby Sanders shared two photos of her and her husband’s hands on Facebook. Not quite the kind of thing you’d expect to go viral, and yet, more than 100,000 people have shared the images. Because, well, the story is genuinely pretty sweet.
From Sanders’s post:
File it under: So sweet I can’t actually mock it. I’m not crying. YOU’RE crying.
Craig Wright, the weirdo Australian who’s now spent two different news cycles as the center of speculation that he is mysterious Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, backed off a pledge he made earlier this week to provide further proof of his role in the creation of Bitcoin. “I do not have the courage [to provide any kind of proof whatsover],” he writes in a blog post. “I cannot.”
On Monday, Wright published a blog post meant to demonstrate his identity using a method that was quickly discredited by other Bitcoin experts. His “proof,” clever enough to convince those who are not intricately versed in Bitcoin, was revealed as … not much at all.
So Wright made another offer: to move some of the crypto-currency out of the so-called “Satoshi stash” — a bundle of nearly 1 million Bitcoins worth about $450 million. Verifiable via the blockchain, Bitcoin’s public ledger, Satoshi’s trove has sat untouched since Bitcoin’s inception. If Wright really wanted to prove that he is Satoshi, he could move a small amount out of the reserve, demonstrating that he held the private keys to do so. On Wednesday, he announced that “in the coming days” he would move some of those coins.
Now Wright is reneging on his promise to provide more proof, and his website now directs to an emotional good-bye message.
Wright also apologized to his supporters, including early Bitcoin participants Gavin Andresen (who retracted his support for Wright as Satoshi earlier this week) and Jon Matonis. The message ends with the final line “And goodbye.” Wright will presumably not be heard from any time soon.
I can’t say definitively that Wright was lying about being Satoshi Nakamoto, but, boy, this seems like the type of thing someone would do when they’re caught in a lie.
Like teens and young adults across the country, I check Snapchat every morning, hoping to be entertained, or, at the very least, distracted.
Since I have a giant taco for a brain, please help me decide by voting in this very official poll.
In, I guess, honor of Cinco de Mayo, Taco Bell has a sponsored filter on Snapchat that turns your face into a giant taco and pours hot sauce over your shell-wearing head, while flames shoot from your eyebrows.
It’s terrifying. It is the worst Snapchat filter I have ever seen. It’s less face-on-a-taco (funny!) than dying-soul-trapped-eternally-inside-a-taco (existentially troubling!). This is what would happen if you were cursed by a witch sponsored by Yum! Brands. It doesn’t help that the tortilla surface resembles a very bad skin condition.
Gracias.
Today, I was horrified.
And yet … it has the can’t-look-away quality of all great train wrecks. And it’s kind of like a taco-version of those old Gushers ads where the cool kids ate Gushers and their heads turned into giant watermelons and oranges. And who didn’t want to be one of those kids?
There’s a lot of beauty in the world. Take Bentley, the cute pug who meets a beautiful butterfly and — BENTLEY, NOOOOOO!!!!
Bentley, who is currently going viral across dozens of freebooting video accounts on Instagram and Vine, seems sorry for what he did.
We’re glad to see someone improving on a technology that’s been essentially the same since 1947.
Though Apple hasn’t said it explicitly in a while, its products are generally constructed and explained under the guiding principle of “It just works.” This idea is surely an important component of Apple’s success: Its gadgets require no skill or know-how, just the ability to press an “on” button.
Worse, it can completely backfire, occasionally in devastating ways. The most recent case of this comes from James Pinkstone, whose use of Apple Music wiped out his entire collection (122 gigabytes).
The specific issue is that when someone signs up for Apple Music, the service automatically transfers the user’s music collection to the cloud.
Pinkstone writes:
“The cloud” is supposed to make things easier for users: It makes files accessible to you anywhere you are, and helps you keep your hard drive clean and easy. It’s also a boon for companies like Apple, who can now charge fees for cloud services. But only if it actually works.
This can have devastating effects for people who who’ve built up large local music collections (For youngs: Years ago, you had to listen to music on the computer by downloading actual files to your hard drive. It was barbaric.) If your device doesn’t have internet access, your collection becomes inaccessible.
For composers like Pinkstone, who create their own music, it can get even worse.
These use cases are fairly specific, and most Apple customers aren’t composers. Still, taking that control away from the users and deciding for them is Apple’s m.o., and it can frequently yield terrible results.
Consider this: “The piano demo of ‘Sister Jack’ that I downloaded directly from Spoon’s website ten years ago? Replaced with the alternate, more common demo version of the song.” Speaking as one of the leading Spoon fans of the tristate area, I can say that this is devastating.
But “it just works” can be vaguely condescending and paternalistic, at least to the extent that it implies that computers users can’t be trusted with their computers. It’s why apps can often only be installed through the App Store, and why many OS X system files in the Library folder are hidden away, unreachable except by experienced users (or those with access to Google). It’s why Apple says that just dragging a program to the trash uninstalls it (not really).
Apple’s matching service, like most of its cloud services, doesn’t. And it’s doubly bad because iTunes Match mixes local music files with files in the cloud. I can confirm, as someone who has used iTunes Match for almost five years, that the service routinely replaces explicit versions of songs with clean ones — a bit like a storage company surreptitiously entering your locker and replacing your books with new copies where all the swears have been blacked out. Apple’s lengthy terms of service explicitly state that it’s not responsible if the service screws up, and if someone ends their subscription without redownloading the files, they’re presumably lost forever.
Sometimes, Instagram just isn’t enough. Sometimes, you need to show off your self/brunch/feet/yoga class across your crotch. Which is why there’s now an app that will turn those images into a pair of custom swim trunks.
We made a few mock-ups, in case you’re lacking for inspiration.
The magic of social media is that it offers a candid peek into the lives of our favorite celebrities. Sometimes you see them on vacation! Sometimes you see them at a party! Sometimes you see them buying a new Volkswagen Golf at the dealership in Northampton, Massachusetts!
Yesterday, alternative legend and Dinosaur Jr. front-man J Mascis picked up a new ride, and thanks to Facebook, now we know about it.
Enjoy the new ride, J! I love the song “Pieces.”
Luxury swimwear designer Orlebar Brown’s new SnapShort 2.0 app lets you take your Instagram pictures (or any photo on your camera roll) and turn them into swimwear. You just upload a picture, zoom and crop as you’d like the image to appear when you’re splashing around in a pool, and press order.
You can download the Orlebar Brown app from both the Apple store and Google Play. Or try the browser version here.
Prices start at $595, so the trunks definitely aren’t for bargain shoppers. Still, can you really put a price on a swimsuit featuring a photograph from a concert you went to? (Well, you can; Orlebar Brown just did. But you know what I mean.)
In the past, pop megastar Justin Bieber has claimed to be pretty good at basketball, attracting adulation from hoops neophytes, but also attracting the skepticism and ire of informed hoops consumers like Deadspin’s Tom Ley.
Today, for reasons I couldn’t possibly be convinced to care enough about to look into, Bieber has decided that his ostensible basketball skills are not being sufficiently respected, and he has posted an Instagram video as “proof” — imagine me doing exaggerated air quotes with my hands for 45 seconds — of his jump-shooting abilities:
Something immediately stands out to a savvy viewer like, well, Ley:
Ley is being too coy by half here. For anyone who knows anything about basketball, this video is an astoundingly transparent attempt to manufacture the illusion of competent three-point shooting where there may well be none.
What people who don’t play basketball might not realize is that it is not hard, even at the sub-amateur level, to hit a three-point shot once in a while. I can vouch for this as a frequent pick-up baller who is abysmal at three-point shooting (as well as several other components of the game). Anyone who plays basketball consistently can knock down a trey or two. The mark of a great three-point shooter is consistency — the ability to string together make after make, or at least maintain an impressive overall percentage. That’s why everyone freaked out when shooting Über-virtuoso Stephen Curry reportedly hit 77 threes in a row (and 94 out of 100) during a practice last year.
That lame little through-the-legs layup at the end is pretty weak sauce, too.
The absence of consecutive shots Bieber makes in the video is an alarm screaming like one of his hysterical tween fans. Watch the video. Beebs has a rebounder corralling every one one of his shots, meaning he was able to get up a lot of attempts in a short period (as opposed to when you are chasing down your own rebounds). It would be the easiest thing in the world for the pop star to have posted video of him making two, three, four three-point shooters in a row — something any decent pick-up three-point shooter (not me) can do fairly regularly.
The video features 14 made three-pointers. But out of how many? If the answer is 28, that’s a pretty impressive percentage for an amateur player in an empty gym. If the answer is 50, then Bieber is, like me, a terrible three-point shooter. Where’s the raw footage? Where’s the proof? How are we supposed to know what to believe?
Back in March, the U.K.’s Natural Environmental Research Center ran a public poll to help choose a name for its new $200,000,000 ship. Thousands of people weighed in with suggestions. “Boaty McBoatface” quickly took the lead, and ultimately won the poll by a landslide.
But the will of the people has been overruled, and the vessel, which will set sail in 2019, won’t be named Boaty McBoatface. Because of fascism, and also because the official terms of the NERC poll said it was looking for “suggestions.”
Instead, this morning the NERC announced on Twitter that the ship will be named after famed English broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough. (Mr. Attenborough, if you’re reading this, would you be down to change your name to Boaty McBoatface?)
While it’s not exactly a multimillion-dollar bright red boat, the NERC did throw the internet a bone with an announcement that it is christening this undersea vehicle with the web’s chosen name.
Welcome to the world, Boaty.
Mother’s Day is on Sunday, but I’m sure you already knew that.
On the off chance that you didn’t, or you are like me and have an un-stamped card sitting on your desk that has yet to be mailed, here’s a great last-minute gift idea sure to haunt your mom’s dreams for years to come: a $30,000 3-D-printed replica of yourself.
If you’re interested, the deal is available on Groupon, courtesy of 3-D-printing company SWIGRO. The $30,000 price tag includes travel fare up to $2,500 so you can visit SWIGRO and ensure that your 3-D rendering is as uncanny as possible. (Only the best for Mom.)
Or you could just save yourself $30,000 (minus the cost of your monthly cell-phone plan) and you know, call your mom. It’s up to you.
From SWIGRO:
I hope it’s not rude to say, but unless you are one of a few hundred people on the planet, you are probably never going to climb Mount Everest. You do, on the other hand, probably have Snapchat. (If you don’t, our Snapchat 101 is a good place to start.)
Ballinger and Richards, who we first spotted over on Mashable, arrived at base camp on April 25. Since then they’ve been documenting everything from what they are eating (a shit ton of Soylent) to their jams of choice (the Lumineers). And, of course, lots and lots of spectacular views.
So do yourself a favor and start following @EverestNoFilter, an account run by Adrian Ballinger and Corey Richards, two dudes who are currently attempting to summit the world’s tallest mountain and documenting the whole thing on Snapchat. (Mount Everest got 4G coverage back in 2013.)
As of Friday morning, the guys were snapping from 24,500 feet of elevation. Because they’re doing the trek without supplemental oxygen (like climbing Everest isn’t metal enough), they have to work their way up incrementally, climbing back to a base camp daily as they make their way to the top. Which is good for us, because it means more snaps.
Now I just want to know who their service provider is, because I can’t even get my phone to send a Snapchat from the subway platform, much less many thousands of feet above sea level.
The Hugo Awards, the top honors for science fiction, have been embroiled in controversy over their nomination and voting process over the past few years. This year, that meant that (web-)famous erotica author Chuck Tingle’s Space Raptor Butt Invasion was nominated for an award. But we should back up.
For the past two years, as Jay Hathaway explains at the Daily Dot, the Hugos have been targeted by right-wing voters angry with the increasing recognition of diversity in science fiction. You might think of these people, allied in groups with names like Sad Puppies and Rabid Puppies, as a pulp-fiction corollary to Gamergate — the video-game-centric movement that sees conscious efforts at increasing diversity as an affront. The Puppies campaigns have hijacked the voting process, suggesting terrible nominees and then stuffing the ballot box.
In an attempt to “prove” how corrupt the awards are — and anger more progressive sci-fi fans — the Puppies helped get Chuck Tingle’s Space Raptor Butt Invasion nominated for Best Short Story.
Space Raptor Butt Invasion is about a man and a raptor who become romantically involved in space. “Soon enough,” according to its synopsis, “Lance becomes close with this mysterious new astronaut, a velociraptor. Together, they form an unlikely duo, which quickly begins to cross the boundaries of friendship into something much, much more sensual.”
But Tingle, who is pseudonymous and speaks on Twitter in a stilted, broken cadence, is having none of it. He spent much of this week trolling the Puppies and their ridiculous white-supremacist leader Vox Day on Twitter. He also released a new story, Slammed in the Butt by My Hugo Award Nomination.
Best of all, Tingle has appointed Zoe Quinn — the primary target of the Gamergate horde for the last couple of years — to serve as his proxy should he actually win. In other words, every Puppy vote for Chuck Tingle is also a vote to give Quinn more visibility and a platform to explicitly refute their bullshit.
The 2016 Hugo Award winners will be announced in August at MidAmeriCon II in Kansas City. Slammed in the Butt by My Hugo Award Nomination is available on Amazon.
As the old saying goes, “Selfies are long and art is fleeting.” (Or something like that.)
It is still unclear if and when the statue will be restored to its former glory. Globo also reports that the selfie-taker could be brought up on criminal charges for the incident, but was not hurt.
Since 1890, a statue of Portuguese “child king” Dom Sebastian has stood proudly at the entrance of the Rossio station, in Lisbon. But that reign came to a crashing halt this week, when an anonymous 24-year-old man knocked the statue to the ground while trying to take a selfie, Globo reports.
The same can’t be said for poor Sebastian, who seems pretty broken up over the whole thing. (Sorry.)
Ride-hailing service Lyft announced yesterday that, next year, it would begin testing autonomous vehicles in the wild. The result of a partnership with GM, which invested half a billion dollars in Lyft earlier this year, the test means Lyft’s driverless vehicles should hit the road before Uber’s, giving the company a possible head start on the automated future of road travel.
According to The Wall Street Journal, “Details of the autonomous-taxi testing program are still being worked out … but it will include customers in a yet-to-be-disclosed city.” Travelers will have the option to opt in or out of the program. GM’s partnership with Lyft means that the new vehicles will likely be Chevy Bolt models, one of the car company’s electric-car models launching later this year.
The GM-Lyft partnership, as the Journal explains, is one partially borne out of second-place necessity. Lyft’s competition, Uber, has a far greater market share, but has said that it won’t have autonomous vehicles on the road until 2020. Likewise, automaker GM’s driverless projects have been eclipsed by those of tech companies like Google and Uber (Apple is also rumored to be working on something car-related). By teaming up and beating Uber and Google to market, GM and Lyft are hoping to be the leaders in the growing subclass of “cars that people can safely have sex in.”
Earlier this week, a Snapchat-birthed relationship between two students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison took over the internet’s collective mind. (You can read our interview with the couple here.)
Exactly what cities can or would be willing to accommodate the new vehicles is not clear. According to one report from the National League of Cities last year, only six percent of long-term transportation plans consider driverless vehicles. Google has been testing its vehicles in California, and Uber’s work is happening around Pittsburgh, but regulations around the country are a hodgepodge. You could almost certainly rule out major markets like New York City and L.A.
First, we meet a blonde female student, dubbed “Spoiler Girl,” who ruins everyone’s day by posting videos explaining the endings of famous movies. In this case, she details the ending of 2001’s Shrek.
Ah yes, young love. Just look at those faces.
Next up, a student enraged by Spoiler Girl’s actions decides that the campus needs to stage some kind of intervention to keep her from spoiling again. Another student chimes in and proposes the intervention be a “silent dance battle” between students who are for and against the spoiler snaps. (More on this later. For now, just: Hmmmm.)
Meanwhile, somewhere else on the Snapchat-filtered hellscape I am envisioning as the Utah State campus, an unsuspecting guy named Trevor sends a snap about studying for his investment banking final to the campus story. Another female student sends him a good luck snap, while her friend, Madison, shouts “you’re hot” from the backseat of a car.
Now, it’s allegedly happening again with the Utah State Snapchat campus story (a public aggregation of snaps from students). Only this time, the whole thing ends with a dance battle and several hundred students singing the campus fight song.
Snapchat stories are usually geofenced, meaning you can only see them from a specific area, like a college campus. But the Utah State story is currently visible under Snapchat’s Live stories, so those of us who aren’t students there can see it for the 24 hours it’ll be live on the app. (Again, hmmmmm.)
Of course, Trevor doesn’t know Madison is Madison (Does anybody in college use Facebook anymore?). Instead he calls her “Mystery Car Girl” and the two coordinate a date for the evening, meeting up for ice cream before the dance battle.
From there, the happy couple heads to the library for the dance battle. (Which, in case you’ve forgotten, concerns the ending of a 15-year-old children’s movie). Based on the snaps, it appears easily 100 students showed up to dance and cheer on their classmates. Trevor and Madison deem themselves the unofficial judges of the event, ruling in favor of “Team Spoiler” after several minutes of painful gyrating. Then they kiss while their classmates hoot, holler, and round out the evening with a rousing chorus of the school song, like the sequel to the sequel to High School Musical.
Now, we’re not saying the stunt was orchestrated by Snapchat (we’ve reached out to the company and will update this story if we hear back). We’re not even saying that it’s fake. We’re just saying, you know: One week after a mega-viral Snapchat romance, another one, involving a dance-off, appears?
Look, that now-viral Snapchat story from the University of Wisconsin, was sentimental pap, yes. But it was charmingly sloppy sentimental pap. It was authentic sentimental pap. Also, it was first. If you want to go viral with your romance, try a different app. (Down to Lunch?)
Mirror, mirror, on the wall…will you get me an Uber, please?
That whole “what kind of tree would you be” question suddenly just got a lot more serious.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Originality: Is the concept original? From “yet another video of that guy playing the electric drum machine at Union Square” to “the guy who invented ‘It’s showtime!’”

Why you should follow: Is it worth my precious newsfeed space? From “I don’t care about your breakfast foods” to “omg this is giving me life right now.”
I used to think a lot about the things that could happen if people on the subway talked to each other like regular humans. Just imagine the networking possibilities! The friendships that could arise! The problems that could be solved! But I’ve since stopped fantasizing about disrupting the Don’t-Start-Conversations policy of subway riders — because if we all started talking to each other we probably wouldn’t have time to Instagram the many weird and wonderful things the city’s underground has to offer.
Concept: Pictures of people’s hands, on the subway.
Quality: For all that zoom, the photos are remarkably clear.
Subway Hands
Why you should follow: They tried to tell us the eyes are the windows to the soul — but it’s been hands all along. After following this you’ll never look at your digits the same way again.

Concept: Like a style blog, but about books.
Quality: Nice use of the inkwell filter (so everyone has good skin), but the photos tend to look the same.
Originality: A highbrow twist on Humans of New York, although a really accurate one would feature people holding up Kindles with copies of Grey and admitting to their recent experiments in bondage.
Why you should follow: Constantly updated book recommendations!

Quality: The MTA spends more time choosing filters than balancing budgets.
Originality: Is there anything new about a brand trying to expand its cool factor with nice pics on social media? No.
Musical.ly, an app you’ve probably never heard of unless you are a teen, or the proud owner of a teen, just raised $100,000,000 in funding. Which means it’s time for you to learn what it is, what it does, and why it’s worth so much money.
Besides the lip-syncing, the app sets itself apart with a time-lapse aesthetic: Many of the videos are recorded with the music being played at half-speed, so the end product looks sped-up, like a time-lapse video.
At its heart, Musical.ly, launched in 2014, is a video-sharing social network along the lines of Snapchat or Vine. What sets it apart is the gimmick: Lip-syncing. For every video you record, you pick a song, and are supposed to lip-sync along to it, creating a mini (no more than 15 seconds) music video. You can then share it, either in the app itself, or on Vine, Twitter, or Instagram. It’s similar to Dubsmash, if you know what that is. Or think of the very old-school app “Singing Along to Something While Staring at the Bathroom Mirror.”
Hot Dudes Reading
Here’s something you might not know: The internet loves cats. It freaking adores them. Cats and the internet go together like peanut butter and jelly. Cats? Internet! Same difference. Might as well call it the caternet. Heh. Anyway, folks.
The Associated Press reports that the newest web hit in South Korea is Cats Meok Bang, a show in which people watch stray cats show up and eat food. Watching humans eat food on a livestream is already incredibly popular in the country, and cats seem like the logical next step.
In some ways, the stream’s boringness is key to the show’s success:
Launched only four months ago, Koo Eun-je says he started the channel just for him and his wife. Now, more than 110,000 people show up each month to watch roughly a dozen strays eat.
The stream is changing views on stray cats in Korea, which older generations still regard “as a wicked, untrustworthy animal.”
The live feed is only viewable in Korea, but diligent fans are putting archives on YouTube. It’s pleasant. You’ll probably like it.
When I first opened the app, I was accosted by an auto-playing video of a girl doing back flips to the tune of Ke$ha’s “We R Who We R,” one of today’s featured videos from a Musical.ly user. You can also follow specific users, which will populate those videos in your feed.
From there, I pressed the yellow plus-sign at the bottom of my screen to record my own music video. Filming on the app was simple enough, and while I don’t think I’ll be going viral anytime soon (Musical.ly celebs say a good video is all about the hand movements), I was pleased with my take.
Still, despite the app’s growing popularity and funds, not everybody is madly in love with Musical.ly. After a quick Twitter, I found one complaint kept cropping up from teens online.
The app is “ruining” their favorite songs.
Another day, another sad grandparent stealing the hearts of Twitter.
Lily and Jenean Jourdan have an adorable 89-year-old grandmother, Magdalene, who loves to paint. But when Magdalene hosted an art show at the local library in her Connecticut town, essentially nobody showed up, BuzzFeed News reports.
Since then, lots of people have replied with tweets of love and support for Magdalene and her art.
It’s reminiscent of Pawpaw, the now-viral grandfather whose grandkids abandoned him at the dinner table back in March. (He is doing fine now and you can read about that here.)
Lily had a softball game and Jenean had to work, so neither could attend, Jenean told BuzzFeed. Two townspeople, their parents, and one uncle brought the total number of guests to a whopping five people.
Sad! Here, let one of Magdalene’s paintings cheer you up.
Like any good teen, Lily used her grandmother’s sadness as a springboard for a viral moment, with this tweet that has since been retweeted over 15,000 times.
She said she is probably sleeping because she was so upset on Thursday.
No word yet on how Magdalene feels about going viral. Jenean told BuzzFeed the she hadn’t heard from their grandmother since the no-show show, saying Magdalene was probably “sleeping” because she was “so upset.”
Ummmm.
Of course, it’s possible this video is an elaborate hoax. (On the internet? Shocking!) But if it’s not, that had to really hurt.
One teenage source who has Musical.ly on her phone suggested that the user base skews young (not surprising, given that its biggest stars tend to be YouTube and Vine sensations like Jenna Marbles): “I definitely know a lot more middle schoolers than high schoolers who use it,” Gabby said.
Last week, this video of a guy eating an ear of corn using an electric drill went viral on Reddit.
Here is how people think crowdfunding works: Someone pledges money to a project, and in exchange they receive exactly the item that they contributed money toward. This can be in the form of notoriety (a thank-you) or, more often, material goods.
Here is how crowdfunding actually works: You throw money into the Phantom Zone and maybe something comes out of the Phantom Zone. It is almost never precisely what you imagined you would receive.
This uncertainty when it comes to crowdfunding is why Paypal has decided to stop protecting transactions made on crowdfunding platforms like IndieGogo. In a statement to TechCrunch, the payment service wrote:
By routing contributions through Paypal, backers could add an extra insurance policy to their crowdfunding work, and then dispute the charge if they didn’t receive their rewards on time, or at all. Crowdfunding still has an optics problem, because prospective contributors see themselves as preordering a developed product. In reality, they’re putting money into the project at a much earlier stage.
Unlike most online transactions, the possibility of a crowdfunding campaign going south are considerably higher. According to a report from Kickstarter last year, nine percent of projects funded on the site failed to deliver their promised rewards. (Statistics for other platforms are not available, but based on what I’ve heard anecdotally I doubt they’re much better.) That number seems low until you frame crowdfunding as a purchase, as backers often do. Imagine if nine percent of your Amazon orders went undelivered, but you still got charged for them.
All of this is to say: Don’t contribute to crowdfunding campaigns. I mean, maybe do it if you personally know the body requesting money, or if they have a proven track record, but don’t give $75 to some bozo who developed an iPhone case that maybe glows in the dark. Or, at least, if you do give money to one of these things, don’t expect anything in return. If the product is really good enough, odds are you’ll be able to buy it via regular means soon enough.
“Fortunately the doctor said the hair will grow normally within a period of six months,” explains the video’s caption on YouTube. While we can’t verify that, we’re hoping for the woman’s sake it’s true. If not, at least Snapchat has that great hat filter these days.
And now I’d like to formally dispel any recommendation that using power tools is an effective corn-eating hack. Because, based on a new video that’s making the rounds on Facebook, it seems like a pretty terrible idea. Especially if you have any intentions of keeping your hair.
Facebook’s black box is slowly being opened. Last week, after speaking with a number of former Facebook news curators, Gizmodo revealed how the “Trending Topics” sidebar is generated: Its stories are selected and summarized by human editors choosing from a group of topics culled by an algorithm. Today, in a follow-up report, new details were revealed — most juicily, that “workers prevented stories about … conservative topics from appearing” in the sidebar.
Radiohead fans on Reddit are eating their … well, their pictures of Thom Yorke, after vowing to do so if the band released a new album last week.
Gizmodo’s reporting on the subject is enormously valuable to anyone interested in Facebook’s increasing power over news media. But it also raises the question: What do we want out of Facebook? And what does Facebook itself want to be?
And then A Moon Shaped Pool dropped on Friday. Since then fans have been sharing videos making good on their promise.
Yum.
Most kids have to wait until they are at least old enough to say “Ellen DeGeneres” before going viral. But baby Kaiori Ayotunde Omautan Wusu is already making a name for herself online, thanks to her inventive dad, and a “Circle of Life” parody that stars her as baby Simba.
Following her birth at the end of April, Kaiori’s dad (sans shirt) re-created the classic Lion King scene, complete with a smear of cocoa butter on his daughter’s forehead and hospital staffers jumping around excitedly as stand-ins for the animals of the Sahara.
For those of you that don’t have an adorable newborn lying around, a cat makes a decent substitute if you’re feeling inspired.
Now, more than 40,000 have watched the family’s video on YouTube. (Not to mention the several freebooted versions that are making the rounds on Facebook.)
Remember how great and fun high school was? Turns out, it’s still just as great and fun. A junior at Los Osos High School in California opened her yearbook this spring to discover that her name, Bayan Zehlif, had been wrongly printed as “Isis Phillips.”
“I am extremely saddened, disgusted, hurt and embarrassed that the Los Osos High School yearbook was able to get away with this,” Zehlif captioned a photo of the misprint on Facebook. “Apparently, I am ‘Isis’ in the yearbook. The school reached out to me and had the audacity to say that this was a typo. I beg to differ, let’s be real.”
According to the school’s superintendent, Matt Holton, Zehlif’s name was switched with that of another student, one whose name is actually Isis, the Los Angeles Times reports.
This isn’t the first time a woman named Isis has run into trouble as a result of her name (and the name’s connection to the Islamic extremist group by the same name). Back in November, another woman named Isis was temporarily blocked from using Facebook, and she said, “Facebook thinks I’m a terrorist. Apparently sending them a screenshot of my passport is not good enough for them to reopen my account.” Facebook later apologized and unlocked her account.
The school is conducting an investigation and has stopped circulating the yearbook with the mistake. Students have been asked to return their yearbooks, and new ones, with Bayan’s correct name under her picture, will be issued.
This culinary innovator went for a Thom Yorke smoothie.
Creeps. Every last one of ’em.
Take, for example, the claim that Facebook workers “routinely suppressed conservative news stories.” “Depending on who was on shift, things would be blacklisted or trending,” Gizmodo’s source — a conservative former curator — tells reporter Michael Nuñez.
This is telling: The claim isn’t quite that conservative news was “suppressed” — as Nuñez acknowledges, “there is no evidence that Facebook management mandated or was even aware of any political bias at work” — but that editors in charge of the sidebar weren’t picking out the conservative trending topics. (And, given that list of overlooked topics, which range from IRS conspiracy theories, to an unreliable news aggregator, to a brutally unfunny conservative comedian, can you blame them?)
As an exercise, imagine reading the quotation above and learning it was being spoken about the New York Times or the Washington Post. Weird, right? Because it wouldn’t, really, be news: When you buy or read the Times or the Post you expect to be consuming the end result of a series of editorial decisions about the topics to cover, and the angles and prominence of the coverage. (In fact, those editorial decisions are the reason to buy the paper!) If the Times declines to cover Steven Crowder, it’s not because it’s “suppressing” conservative news. It’s because its editors have made the judgment that Crowder, and whatever thing he did, are not newsworthy.
So Facebook, as Gizmodo writes, “operates like a traditional newsroom,” and ultimately how you feel about that rests less on your politics than on your understanding of what Facebook is, and what it’s for. If you understand Facebook as a publication, it’s hardly surprising to learn that decisions are being made about what gets coverage (and how).
But Facebook has implicitly and explicitly presented itself not as a publication but as a distribution mechanism — an unbiased and neutral platform whose sidebar lists nothing more complicated than “topics that have recently become popular on Facebook.” As with its Messenger service, it obfuscates the humans making decisions on the other side of the screen.
None of which is to argue that Facebook shouldn’t have human curators sorting through its topics. There will never be a perfect algorithm to identify and summarize popular stories. That Facebook is using human editorial judgment to determine which topics are worth highlighting and which are not is almost cheering — an indication that the company has some sense of the enormous power it now holds. Facebook is the world’s biggest publication, after all. It’s just not willing to admit it.
It supposedly offers many of the same benefits as an immersion tank, without requiring you to get naked and shut yourself inside a dark, wet chamber. So that’s neat.
More than the politics at play, it’s the lack of transparency that’s troubling. Facebook has some 1.5 billion users around the globe; the algorithms that determine the sorting of its News Feed can create and destroy entire companies; and it wasn’t until Gizmodo’s story last week that anyone outside Facebook had a clear sense of how it determined its Trending Topics. (Last August, for example, Recode reported that “what Facebook adds to the trending section” is chosen “automatically by the algorithm.”)
“I’m not exactly sure why I’m offering again aside from my own twisted enjoyment and a coping method to take my thoughts off the new record,” wrote one Redditor, who was joined, inexplicably, by a dozen more. “If it happens to be released or announced tomorrow, I will eat a picture of Thom Yorke in order to apologize to all the May 6 believers I’ve doubted. My fate is in the bands hands now.”
Drone racing is taking the world (and, of course, the Internet) by storm. And the views are incredible.
Like every other human being on the planet, I saw Captain America: Civil War this past weekend. It was great. The superpeople are at it again, punching and quipping — and Spider-Man was there. Very cool. Loved it.
As a technology blogger, though, something bothered me: The Avengers and their enemies — some of Earth’s most powerful and intelligent people/robots — are using incredibly outdated and inefficient workflows.
(I’m going to spoil Civil War so, you know, heads up.)
Problem: Baron Zemo wants to show Iron Man a video of Bucky Barnes killing his parents. How can he quickly and easily share this video?
That should be more than enough! Otherwise, put it on YouTube with “Unlisted” privacy settings. To reiterate, it’s free! Just email a hyperlink.
Here’s another, outside-the-box, solution: Do you need to show the video? Why not get a burner number from Google Voice or Skype and call Iron Man with the news that Bucky Barnes murdered his parents? Sometimes, nothing beats a person-to-person conversation.
Problem: Captain America wants to contact Iron Man while on the lam. How can he maintain security?
Select All’s Solution: Unfortunately, a dinky flip phone from the year 2004 is not secure. The government is going to trace that thing in a second. And by introducing FedEx into the equation, you’re increasing the number of people in the chain of custody — and decreasing your security. So what’s a superhero on the run to do? It’s easy: Just download WhatsApp, which has end-to-end encryption, and make sure you both have message backup turned off. Alternately, set up a secure PGP key.
Baron Zemo’s Solution: Zemo frames Barnes by bombing the United Nations, setting in motion a plot that eventually drags Barnes, Iron Man, and Captain America to Siberia. Once the trio finds Zemo in Siberia, Zemo shows Tony Stark a video of Bucky killing Stark’s parents.
Look, I know. It’s easy to get attached to the tried-and-true. But technology has allowed teams of all kinds, good and evil, to make better use of their resources. Why aren’t the Avengers on Slack, for example? Has Tony Stark considered using the Scrum methodology to tackle difficult projects? Here are some tips — lifehacks, if you will — that the Avengers could make good use of.
Select All’s Solution: Dropbox! Dropbox is free. You get two gigabytes gratis. Type “dropbox.com” into your web browser (one of them should be preinstalled on your computer) and sign up for an account. You can upload the file from your web browser or download the desktop program to sync files automatically.
Captain America’s Solution: At the end of the movie, Steve Rogers contacts Iron Man by sending Tony Stark a burner flip phone and a handwritten note in a FedEx package.
Problem: No one knows where Hulk and Thor are.
Iron Man’s Solution: Give up.
Select All’s Solution: While Tony Stark’s commitment to lightweight development models may have worked when the Avengers were a start-up, when an organization scales it can be difficult to keep track of what everyone’s up to. While some companies use employee-tracking software, we recommend a somewhat less heavy-handed approach. Why not get the Avengers into Slack, and use the popular workplace chat software to have regular check-ins with absent colleagues?
Update: This post has been edited to clarify that Kickstarter’s payment system is not integrated with Paypal.
Juggling is hard. Drumming is hard. So we’re going to go out on a limb and say that juggling while drumming is really hard.
A video of a very coordinated guy who has perfected this obscure skill is making the rounds online today. It features Spaniard Fuman Musicoloco, a true artist who has made a name for himself with performances that blend acrobatics, percussion, and clowning. (Get you a man who can do both. Or all three, as it were.)
Watch it, if not for his impressive coordination then for the repetitive melody playing in the background, which gets pretty soothing after 613 or so views.
On Saturday, voters in Austin, Texas, rejected an effort by ride-sharing services Uber and Lyft to change local regulations. Proposition 1, as it was known, would have overturned rules passed by the city last December, which required, among other things, fingerprint-based background checks for drivers.
Uber and Lyft, according to The Wall Street Journal, “spent $8.6 million on an aggressive local marketing campaign to push through the proposition, which flooded the city with fliers and sent robocalls and text messages to residents.” The push was not well-received. Uber in particular has come under fire for lax background checks, but the company stands by their current system, which does not require finger-printing.
As such, Lyft and Uber — which is the most highly valued private technology company and which uses its glut of venture capital to steamroll through legislative barriers — have both shut down services in Austin. The move is a pressure tactic to encourage the public to complain to their local governments (Uber, as far as I know, is the only tech company that regularly emails its user base encouraging them to sign petitions and contact regulators).
An anecdotal sampling of Twitter chatter shows some wondering what will happen if Uber isn’t back in time for South By Southwest next spring.
This is Uber’s thing — it builds itself into commuters’ lives through brute force and then waits for legislation to catch up through not-quite-extortion stoppages. It’s a game of chicken they’ve played all over the country, including in Portland, Las Vegas, and Miami, and in all three cases, they got what they wanted. Austin is now the largest city without Uber. That’s only temporary.
During game four of last night’s playoff series between the Portland Trail Blazers and the Golden State Warriors, living maxed-out NBA LIVE create-a-player Steph Curry went into overdrive, scoring 17 points in the final five minutes of the game.
He was so good that he even left Paul Allen — the Ringo of Microsoft co-founders — speechless, like a real-life Mr. Krabs.
Get well soon, Paul!
Deanna Pilling thought she was doing a nice thing when she arrived on the Utah State campus to surprise her daughter, McKenna, and help her move out for the summer.
In case you needed further proof that nothing good ever happened on a hoverboard, I present to you: Tostitos Tyler.
This isn’t the first time in recent weeks that Pilling’s school, Utah State University, has made headlines. The school was also host to a now-viral Snapchat love story/dance battle just last week. What’s in the water out there?
To let her daughter know she was in her dorm room, Deanna did what any mom in 2016 might: She whipped out her cell phone and sent McKenna a selfie from her bed.
“My mom wishes she would have taken a better selfie to send me,” McKenna told Fox 40, discussing the popularity of her tweet.
There was just one problem: McKenna was in her own bed. Her mother had wandered into a stranger’s bed. (They later discovered the bed belonged to a friend of McKenna’s who lived in the same building.)
McKenna (again, as any daughter in 2016 might) tweeted the selfie and the subsequent texts between her and her mother, and more than 16,000 people have shared them since.
A video of Tostitos Tyler (not his real name) hit Reddit last night and has already been viewed 50,000 times. It depicts the dramatic scene at a West Hollywood convenience store at 5 a.m., as a hoverboarder with a dog pursues three of life’s most essential food products: pasta, Pop-Tarts, and, of course, Tostitos.
For your reading pleasure, here’s a full transcript of Tostitos Tyler’s rant. The dramatic apex comes when it’s revealed that this is not the first time Tostitos Tyler has battled with this particular West Hollywood gas-station clerk. (Warning: NSFW language. Tostitos Tyler doesn’t fuck around.)
It’s terrible, and you should never aspire to be anything like Tostitos Tyler. But there is also something about watching this guy with a half-formed man-bun riding a hoverboard while screaming “Tostitos!” that I can’t stop watching.
After the unlucky cashier, I think I feel worst of all for Tostitos Tyler’s dog, who had to sit through this whole ordeal leashed to a dude ranting on a hoverboard.
Earlier this week, Irish politician Alan Tobin, posted a picture of a park sign in County Meath on Facebook. The sign, which Tobin “asked for,” showed pictures of 10 dog breeds that Tobin declared “dangerous,” and it detailed strict leash and muzzling rules for bringing said breeds out in public.
Tobin later apologized on morning talk show Ireland AM, explaining his intentions were only rooted in public safety. So next time you want someone to apologize, try a cute dog.
Or this guy. Look at that face. If that’s not terrifying I don’t know what is.
Like these scary Rhodesian ridgebacks saying hello to a tiny baby.
Anyone who’s ever posted anything about pit bulls knows what happened next: Owners of the supposedly dangerous breeds showed up. There was some flaming and some righteous anger. But more than anything else, there were lots of photos of cute dogs, left in the comments by their owners.
Somebody should really warn this cat.
“As a dog owner I’m absolutely delighted that signs I’ve asked for, with pictures, showing the dangerous breeds of dogs have been erected over the past week. It still amazes me that some people think these dogs are ideal family pets,” Tobin captioned the photo of the sign.
Sadly, the feel-good/feel-embarrassed-about-how-little-you’ve-accomplished story of a Canadian 15-year-old discovering a previously undiscovered Mayan city isn’t quite as impressive as first hoped.*
The tale, as it went viral (and as we originally wrote it), was simple: Canadian 15-year-old William Gadoury thought he’d found an abandoned Mayan city deep in the heart of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. Using star maps, Gadoury discovered that 22 major Mayan cities correlated with the brightest stars in constellations. He was the first person, teen or otherwise, to use this method, the Telegraph reported, and using the location he determined from the third star, Gadoury connected with the Canadian Space Agency, who sent the teen satellite images showing visible geometric shapes consistent with a lost city. Gadoury (as well as Dr. Armand Larocque, a remote sensing specialist from the University of New Brunswick) believes it’s a central Mayan pyramid, with several other nearby structures.
Gadoury discovered what he thinks is a lost city — which he has named K’aak Chi or “Mouth of Fire” — when he tried matching stars in a 23rd constellation to Mayan cities. He was able to connect two of the stars in that constellation with known ruins, but when he couldn’t find a correlating city for the third star, his interest was piqued.
Using the location he determined from the third star, Gadoury connected with the Canadian Space Agency, who sent the teen satellite images showing visible geometric shapes consistent with a lost city. Gadoury (who has now teamed up with Dr. Armand Larocque, a remote sensing specialist from the University of New Brunswick) believes it’s a central Mayan pyramid, with several other nearby structures.
Of course, this discovery has yet to be verified and no expedition has been planned as of yet.
“Dream of my life.” Kids these days.
“It would be the culmination of my three years of work and the dream of my life,” Gadoury told the Telegraph of his hopes to get to explore the possible city.
Few rituals hold as much importance as the one Nintendo performed today: The three new starter Pokémon were revealed.
You can see the new trailer and our very thorough analysis of the new Pokémon below.
Brian Feldman: Even before we get to the new Pokémon, I would like to point out that Professor Oak looks super chill.
Christine Friar: Yes! Everything is, like, vacation-themed. The guy who presents these three new Pokémon to you is wearing a yellow kimono and looks blissed as fuck. Take me there.
BF: That guy is ready to party, for sure. It’s weird that vacation in Pokémon is just the same as normal life: You’re still making small creatures fight.
CF: You have a belt of sweet hostages who have to listen to your every command. But now there are palm trees.
BF: “Hey, guys, let’s take a break from fighting, and go fight … on an island.”
CF: “I’m wiped from telling you guys which fights to fight, so let’s hop over to this island, and I’ll tell you what to do there.”
BF: Do you have any thoughts on the new starters overall as a group?
CF: Initial reactions: Litten is who I would probably choose (even though I could see it being a throwaway vanity plate of a Pokémon, like an Eevee). And I think the owl has a surprising number of traits for a starter. Flying and grass are two types! Usually they’re just like, “I’m blue, which means water; I make bubbles.”
How about you?
BF: Oh, man, Nintendo knocked it two-thirds of the way out of the park. Litten and Rowlet: great; love them. Popplio: absolutely not.
BF: I guess we should just get this out of the way: I hate Popplio already.
CF: Talk to me about that.
CF: The sound he makes is “bwark.” But he says it with a question mark — “bwark?” — which I think is very telling.
BF: Indecision will get you killed in Pokéland.
CF: The pose he does around :54 is very endearing.
BF: That is, I will admit, a great pose. I guess I just have a beef with clownish Pokémon. It’s a terrible gimmick.
CF: He’s definitely a clown.
BF: Popplio with his goddamn Patch Adams nose.
CF: What would it take for you to pick Popplio over the other two?
BF: Each of these guys has another two evolutions, so if his next two are crazy-cool, I could see pushing through the early stages with Popplio.
CF: Right, like if that hands-on-hips pose manifested into a prissy business seal down the road I think I could get onboard. If he remains a benign tumor with large sympathetic eyes, I cannot imagine ever electing to give a shit.
CF: Holy shit. You’re right.
BF: Otherwise, that’s … some sort of flesh collar? WTF.
CF: Wait, Rowlet has a leaf bow tie. And you stan for him.
CF: The slow pan of his head turning to face forward again could be pretty chilling with a different soundtrack.
Rowlet … sees youRowlet … has been watching this whole time.
I just imagined what he might evolve into for the first time. For some reason the idea of just a much bigger owl is very satisfying.
It only happens once every few years, and it happened again today. Whenever Nintendo releases another version of Pokémon (this year, the pair of games are Sun and Moon), players are presented with three new fighting monsters. This is a momentous occasion for Pokémon fans (a group that includes … nearly every single person in the U.S. and Japan under the age of 30), and experts such as ourselves are closely watching the announcement.
The scrutiny also highlights the dangers of Facebook’s vagueness surrounding its services. In this case, Facebook is a victim of its own actions — hiding its human editors beneath the guise of algorithmic consistency. (It’s important to distinguish between “inconsistency” and “bias.” Algorithms can be coded with biases, but they perform that function consistently.) Humans, who think and breath and act, do not act consistently, even when we like to think that we do.
“Fixing Dorne Productions” says that if its Kickstarter reaches its $20,000,000 goal, it will “patch” the unfortunate Dorne plotline of last season:
You mostly shouldn’t, though.
The problem’s gotten a little better recently; some companies have outsourced their TV’s smarts to Google, either through Android TV or Google Cast, while LG uses something called webOS, which is mostly fine. These are still largely side projects of giant companies, though, versus the people at Roku, who spend their days working only at improving Roku. Besides, a separate streaming device is more flexible; why spend more money on a smart TV when for a few more bucks you can make any TV smart?
Best for: Slightly more than casual gamers, Apple fanatics, the monied class.
Once you get accustomed to not having a physical remote, or a way to navigate apps other than thumbing through your phone, Chromecast ends up being surprisingly great. In some ways, it saves a step. The downside? Phones run out of battery a lot more often than remotes, and if yours is dead or goes missing, no streaming for you.
Luckily, the culprit left a note. But when Callow opened it, he didn’t find any contact information or insurance details.
As for the note, Callow says someone claiming to be its writer reached out after seeing the tweet, but he can’t be sure it was actually them. “IDK them at all,” he told me.
Still, he doesn’t seem to be any worse for wear. “I have gotten over 50 girls’ phone numbers, so life is pretty good,” Callow said.

In late April, I checked out the Tribeca Film Festival’s storytelling tech showcase Storyscapes with Manoush Zomorodi, host of WNYC’s tech show Note to Self. Between bouts of nausea, we talked about the possibilities of virtual reality, from therapeutic uses like the undersea breathing exercise we underwent to consumer products like The Turning Forest, the BBC-sponsored children’s story we watched (or experienced?). You can listen below, or at WNYC’s site here.
Instagram released a new logo today. My official review: It’s fine. It’s whatever. I’ll still use the app. But, more interestingly: The minimalist redesign’s gradient color scheme bears a striking resemblance to one of Microsoft PowerPoint’s preset slide backgrounds. Specifically: “Early Sunset.”
Let’s get this out of the way: Facebook won’t face any punishment over this, from the Senate or any other body — not that they even should, from a legal perspective. Facebook is a private technology company, after all. But the blowup over Trending Topics, severe enough to reach the halls of Congress, illustrates that a considerable number of the service’s billion and a half users have come around to the understanding that Facebook, private company or not, is enormously powerful. And the Gizmodo stories — and Facebook’s mealymouthed public response — reveal a company unsure how to wield that power, and seemingly unable to accept any of the responsibilities that come with it.
The lack of further explanation (or even acknowledgment of a problem) in Stocky’s post isn’t unprecedented. For the first decade of its life, Facebook did the smartest thing and kept quiet. The company, smooth and clean and functional in a way its rivals weren’t, never over-explained or pre-announced features. New technology is popular in part because it can seem like magic. A growing, learning directory of all friends new and old, giving you exactly the information that you crave before you even know that you want it!
“There are rigorous guidelines in place” isn’t exactly a satisfactory answer. Unsurprisingly, Facebook has been unwilling to increase its transparency as it increases its power. It’s not obligated to, but it would be nice for a company with the reach and ubiquity of a public institution to have a clear sense of purpose beyond sheer growth, and an explanation of how its products serve that purpose. This, more than unreconstructed bias or shadowy suppression, is what Gizmodo’s stories reveal: a company unsure how to wield its own power. What would you do if, having annexed news media, you suddenly had the attention of their millions of former viewers? Facebook has directed this attention, in part, to plainly terrified, deeply hedged, anonymous summaries of junk-food stories, written by young journalists with no mandate or mission, hired on contract and treated poorly. When challenged on this, it shifts responsibility off of its managers and leaders and onto its system — the rigorous-guidelines black box that made its News Feed so impenetrable, and consequently so rudderless. Facebook has conquered itself an empire and now seems uninterested in ruling it.
On Wednesday, Hyperloop One — the futuristic high-speed vacuum-tube transportation system backed by Tesla founder Elon Musk — ran the first successful test of its propulsion system on a test track in the desert north of Las Vegas, Nevada, as a crowd of excited journalists watched from the stands.
Did you miss it? Here it is again. Listen as the crowd goes politely wild at the end.
Musk imagines the Hyperloop as the perpetually hoped for high-speed rail connection between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The propulsion open-air test, or POAT, lasted about six seconds, with the Hyperloop sled reaching max speeds of 300 mph on the half-mile track, Tech Insider reports.
Drones are good for a lot more than awkward selfies or tours through hard-to-reach locations. Sometimes they can rock a little ballet.
The actual Hyperloop, which could be operational as soon as 2020 (we’ll believe it when we see it), will top out at 700 mph. By comparison, the six-second demonstration seemed a little “underwhelming.”

Google took an unprecedented step earlier today when it announced that it would no longer show ads for payday lenders in search results, starting in July. The announcement marks Google’s first blanket rejection of a broad category of financial services that, while dubious, are not technically illegal.
The decision does not strip payday lenders out of results entirely, only from ads. Still, that means lenders cannot target certain search queries and inject themselves into results that might otherwise not include them, nor can they automatically appear at the top of the list as the first result.
The Community Financial Services Association of America, a trade group for payday lenders, called Google’s decision “unfair towards those that are legal, licensed lenders.” But legality is not the question here — payday lenders took advantage of financially unstable people using the internet to get help. Today, that gets a little bit more difficult.
Google has joined Facebook in rejecting payday lenders, though they still appear in ads on Yahoo, as the Washington Post notes. Previously, Google’s rejected ad subjects were restricted to things that were generally illegal (drugs, guns) or adults-only.
In a post on Google’s Public Policy blog, Director of Global Product Policy David Graff expained:
Payday loans are a predatory type of short-term lending that provide money to those with a low income, usually at astronomical interest rates. They often trap people in a cycle of debt, requiring them to take out additional loans in order to pay off their initial loans and rapidly accruing fees. (For more information, watch John Oliver epically obliterate payday lenders.)
Instagram got a new logo yesterday and app loyalists immediately freaked out about the change. And while change is always hard — especially when logos change — it’s possible nobody had bigger cause for concern than Gregorio Feliciano, a 27-year-old Florida man who four years ago had a version of the now-passé logo tattooed to his arm.
As for his thoughts on Instagram’s newly redesigned look, Feliciano says its “neat,” but that he definitely won’t be getting it inked on his body.
Crowdfunded business ideas don’t always go wrong, but when they do go wrong, they often do so spectacularly. Take, for example, “Peachy Printer,” a Canadian Kickstarter campaign that pledged to build “the world’s most affordable 3D printer.”
Yesterday, the printer’s inventor and part-owner of the company, Rylan Grayston, posted an update with a shocking reveal: His business partner, David Boe, had embezzled more than half of the $587,000 CAD earned by their successful fundraiser on Kickstarter (the full amount raised was $651,091, and more than $63,000 went to Kickstarter and assorted fees). Boe allegedly stole $324,716 CAD and used them to construct a new house.
Grayston has known something had gone wrong for a while — his disclosure to Kickstarter includes an extensive collection of evidence, as well as a couple of slickly produced videos and a complete redesign of peachyprinter.com to focus on the theft. According to the site’s timeline, Grayston spent much of 2014 chasing down Boe and the money looking for answers.
Boe met up with Grayston to record an interview at what appears to be the world’s most drab hotel. In it, Boe admits to embezzling funds, apologizes, and says he’s trying to make it right. There’s no word on how he’ll do that. It is kind of excruciating to watch.
That Boe would participate in this video and fully confess is mind-boggling, but Grayston believes he did so because Boe never believed the video would come out. “I told him I’d only release the video if he failed to pay us back before we were ready to ship,” Grayston told backers.
The theft, as Grayson tells it, happened through a combination of poor planning and a lot of naïveté. Peachy Printer’s corporate bank account was not set up when the company’s Kickstarter closed, so Boe used his personal account to collect the funds. Only Boe had access to the money and could monitor the account. You can see how this went wrong.
So what do you do once you get one? You have to figure out where to put it, first. Mine is ceiling-mounted: I made my own platform-thing out of a plank of wood and some chains from Home Depot; you might prefer to buy a more stable ceiling mount, like this $15 VIVO model.
You’ll also have to deal with the wires that the gadgets will need. (It’s not much; a Roku can be powered by a USB port on the projector itself, and a speaker can be taken down to charge.) That’s easier than it sounds: Get one of these $11 CordMate kits. They’re basically long plastic tubes with adhesive on them; you thread the cables through the tubes, stick them onto your wall, and your projector setup looks about a thousand times more professional.
The total cost of the setup is well under $500. This is more expensive than a 32-inch TV, but what you’re getting is worth it: decent sound, internet connectivity, a gigantic screen that is invisible when you don’t want it, and a surprising feeling of luxury.
I project my image onto my wall, which is off-white; this would probably offend projector experts, which is one of several reasons I don’t allow them into my bedroom. It looks fine. If your room isn’t painted white, or if you don’t have a wall directly in front of your bed, you can get a pull-down screen like this $65 one, or, honestly, you can use a white sheet. If you’re feeling Pinterest-y, you can get a big picture frame with blank posterboard in it, and project directly onto it.
Many of the best projectors don’t really force you to compromise at all. If you read Amazon reviews carefully and keep an eye on resolution and lumens, it’s easy to find something that fits your price range, expectations, and tiny bedroom. This Epson Home Cinema 730HD ($349.99 refurbished) has hundreds of glowing reviews, boasts a 720p resolution, and at 3,000 lumens is bright enough to handle even full sunlight. The AAXA P5 ($339.00) is less bright at 300 lumens, but is much smaller than the Epson and features similarly good reviews. In the other direction, the ViewSonic PJD5155 ($299.88) boasts 3,300-lumen brightness at a lower (800x600) resolution.
Grayston also disclosed that he does not have enough funds to pursue a lawsuit against Boe. He did not respond to an interview request, but we’ll update if we hear back.
The Drawbacks to a Cheap Projector (and Why They Don’t Matter)
Choosing a Projector
Right now, popular Vegan YouTuber Freelee the Banana Girl (the 30-year-old’s boring real person name is Leanne Ratcliffe) is embroiled in several internet battles with her fellow content creators, including Cassey Ho of Blogilates and a 17-year-old named Tana Mongeau.
But one of the most important questions raised by the fight (and there are many) is why the vegan YouTube community seems to be riddled with drama. If you thought vegans were peaceful, you’d be wrong.
The scandals don’t end there. A quick YouTube search for “vegan drama” led me to several informative videos, and, let me tell you, these vegans are just all up in each other’s high-carb, low-fat everything.
According to Freelee, Ho promotes eating disorders and Mongeau is basically full of crap. Accusations are flying. Banana emoji from Team Freelee are popping up in the comments sections of her targets’ Instagram accounts and YouTube channels. Call-outs are being issued. And Freelee still manages to find time in her busy, shit-stirring schedule to eat her daily 51 bananas. Yes. 51. (For more on Freelee, check out this excellent coverage of the truly strange saga from Jezebel.)
Back in 2014, fans of Vegan YouTube body builder and generally fit man Richard Burgess (a.k.a Vegan Gains), descended viciously on another YouTube body builder and generally fit man, Pete Czerwinski (a.k.a. Furious Pete). VG and his army of followers attacked FP for his non-vegan diet (FP regularly films himself eating insane amounts of food, rapdily) and even went as far as to blame FP’s testicular cancer diagnosis on his non-vegan ways. I’m not a doctor, but the claim seems … spurious.
And let’s not forget Essena O’Neill, the Australian teen who went viral at the end of 2015 after announcing on social media that she was quitting social media. (How could we forget Essena O’Neill!) Her world quickly descended into war — no doubt in part because her high follower-count across Instagram and YouTube made her a perfect target for take-down videos from her less famous vegan peers.
Hoy made sure to mention that Animation Factory has more than 500,000 other GIFs. Just wait until the memers find them.

If you’re traveling on the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto, Ontario, today, that’s exactly what you’ll see. But when you pull out your phone (after pulling over, obviously) to Google the Wathan Funeral Home, all you’ll find is a mysterious website explaining that there is no Wathan Funeral Home. The billboard is actually a twisted PSA, and the website offers no other information about who is actually behind the scheme.
The next time you are aimlessly wandering the block grumbling and looking for your Uber driver, remember it could always be worse: Your driver could show up with nothing but a pair of gym shorts casually tossed over his dick.
Strangely, the cat doesn’t look less strange with the addition of two human legs in leopard print pants. Go figure!
The company itself disclosed with a list of 1,000 trusted sources — the news outlets whose reporting Facebook relied on to confirm the accuracy of its Trending Topics summaries. News topics needed to be “corroborated by reporting from at least three Media 1K outlets,” making Facebook, somewhat recursively, a gatekeeper for media gatekeepers. It’s not news until Facebook says that three other places said it’s news.
Welcome to 2016, where your options for landing a summer internship are sending in a standard application and hoping for the best or creating a custom Snapchat geofilter over the office building of your dream company and forcing its employees to see your name every time they send a selfie.
While he managed to grab their attention (Snapchat metrics showed his filter was viewed more than 1,000 times), Horizon Media didn’t end up offering Allgood a position. Which is probably a good thing for us (sorry, Graham), because otherwise every unemployed millennial with a smartphone might try this trick.
Graham Allgood, a junior at California Baptist University, went with the latter option. Since anybody can purchase a temporary geofilter (a Snapchat filter only visible within a certain geographic area), Allgood designed a “HEY HIRE ME” filter and spent $30 to run the filter for one day in May over the offices at Horizon Media (his company of choice.)
It worked. The company called him for an interview the same day, Allgood told Business Insider.
In a dialogue, the site’s leaders, Mallory Ortberg and Nicole Cliffe, explained that they had decided to end the site on their own terms.
But now, it seems like things might be going the other way for Vine, according to a story today in The Wall Street Journal. The app, which just a year ago ranked in the top five in the Apple app store, has fallen to the 200th spot.
Or, as one New York City high school student told me, “Vine is kinda irrelevant now because so many new things have come out and Vine hasn’t really updated anything.” The new things, of course, include Snapchat stories, Instagram’s 60-second video allotment, and most recently, Facebook’s emphasis on video, video, and more video … with a side of live video.
“Vine is mostly full of ads and people promoting other pages now,” Caleb, a 15-year-old from Michigan told me via Twitter DM. “It’s not as popular and full of funny Vines as it used to be.” Caleb thinks he’s the only one of his friends still using the app.
There’s also the issue of the platform’s popularity with brands and major companies. “We’re still seeing a ton of big brands in this space,” Darren Lachtman, co-founder of Niche, a combo talent and advertising agency that specializes in social media platforms like Vine, told the Journal. While that might be true, Vine consumers have also caught on to the game. “Vine stars only do advertisements. It’s so annoying,” Chandler explained. “They don’t make their own content and they only make Vines about M&M’s.”
Though when I reached out to Sam’s older brother (a friend from college) to ask whether I could text his sibling a few questions about Vine, Sam’s brother said “sure,” but that texting wouldn’t be the easiest way to reach him.
“Trending Topics” itself — written in an off-putting alien tongue, containing three or four hedges where they need only one — is not hugely important to Facebook or Facebook’s business plan. It’s not even hugely important to Facebook’s readers: It’s only really a prominent feature on the desktop version of the site, and the vast majority of time spent on Facebook is spent in its mobile app. When journalists and media critics talk about Facebook’s power, they’re talking more about the sorting algorithms that govern the central News Feed, which is only indirectly connected to the Trending Topics.
But learning more about Facebook’s decision-making process can tell us about how Facebook sees itself.
Last week, a 23-year-old Canadian woman was driving through Ontario — in her defense, on a rainy and foggy Thursday night — when she took an errant left turn into a boat launch and found her car plummeting into a lake.
If you’re an unemployed, licensed driver living in the Phoenix, Arizona, area and are comfortable spending several hours a day behind a steering wheel that you can’t touch, Google might just have the perfect job for you.
Last week, the video game website Polygon posted a video entitled “DOOM GAMEPLAY - The First Thirty Minutes” — a preview of the new Doom game that came out on Friday:
Now, any such video released by a major gaming outlet would invite some level of ridicule, but if you look around at the response to this one in particular, it’s clear that things are a bit saltier than usual. And that salt is peppered (sorry) with a bit of a political message:
Thus, the schadenfreude-fueled commentary about the video; thus, the inevitable YouTube responses, some of them admittedly funny:
This argument should sound familiar, because it’s a warmed-over, video-game-focused retread of good old reactionary distrust of mainstream media. In much the same way conservatives claim that the Washington Post and the New York Times and other outlets are hopelessly left-wing and therefore untrustworthy, Gamergaters insist that Kotaku and Polygon (and sometimes IGN and other big outlets that touch on technology and video games — BuzzFeed is one major target of their ire) are hopelessly compromised by their supposed political obsessions with social justice.
In reality, Polygon is — to my mind at least — a good, smart gaming site, and anyone who wants gaming taken seriously should celebrate the fact that games journalists are starting to analyze games’ political messages more critically.
But still: That was a sad, sad Doom performance. You can strafe and shoot at the same time, dammit!
For the last several years, there have been many bold proclamations that nerds are finally cool and no longer receiving swirlies in the locker room after P.E.
Uh, that’s a d20. That’s the 20-sided die everyone who has every played Dungeons & Dragons, or seen it on TV, knows about. Hermès made a d20. That’s nuts; I’m calling it. May 16, 2016 A.D.: Hermès made a d20 and Nerd Culture Is Finally Cool.
Last week, thanks to Todd Selby, I learned of the existence of the Icosahedron, an object being made by highest-end fashion house Hermès, of Paris.
But all of these declarations were wrong. But you know who’s right? Me. I’m the one who decides when nerds finally become cool. Nerds and nerd activities are not cool until I say so. (I’m a geek, I love Mario.)
Here’s what Hermès told us about the world’s most expensive d20, “part of our brand new Equilibre collection that launched this year at Salone.”
Ritzy. Oh, also, it costs $5,850. Asked if the Hermès icosahedron was the most fashionable d20 in the world, a spokeswoman responded, “We envision the object being used as a paperweight.” In other words: It hasn’t been roll-tested.
“We’re all nerds now,” claimed the New York Times in 2014. “Rise of the new geeks: how the outsiders won” proclaimed the Guardian in 2013. “Are ‘geek’ and ‘nerd’ now positive terms?” asked the BBC in 2012. And so on.
Bloomberg reports that Twitter will soon tweak how it counts up to each tweet’s 140-character limit, and will begin excluding photos and links from the allowance. Think of all the extra things you’ll be able to say about the subway creep-shot you’re tweeting!
Regaining 23 characters isn’t that much, but the news is further indication of Twitter’s slowly shifting how its feed functions — tweets as an entry point to larger pieces of content, like videos and longer pieces of writing, rather than self-contained 140-character missives.
Links and photo currently take up 23 characters, regardless of their actual counts. This is because URLs are shortened via Twitter’s t.co link shortener, even though the beginning of the real URL is displayed in tweets. The same goes for photos linked via pic.twitter.com.
For the better part of a year, rumors have persisted that the company wants to get rid of the character limit altogether. Those reports, however, indicated that the feed would be visually similar to how it looks now, with short snippets of text and multimedia attachments. Users would then be able to click to expand anything they wanted further info on.
For now, though, it means users have 23 additional characters, exactly as many characters as the phrase “I really love to tweet!” requires.

Like most things you rely on — your coffee mug, your headphones, your heart — iPhones have a tendency to break. You drop one on the sidewalk and pick it up to find a spiderweb of cracks running through the screen. You walk into a door while texting and the home button decides to call it quits. You’re not entirely sure what you did, but you woke up on Tuesday and the headphone jack was totally shot.
Open Settings and tap “General,” then tap “Accessibility.” Scroll down to “Interaction” and turn on the AssistiveTouch feature. You’ll see a small white dot appear on your screen (you can drag and place the dot along either side of the screen). The dot functions like your now-defunct home button.
If you’re not quite ready to go all in and use accessibility mode full-time, consider playing with your lock-screen settings. Under “General” you can set the length of time before your phone will lock, from 30 seconds to five minutes. Or you can turn off the auto-lock feature entirely to make sure your device only locks when you want it to. (Of course, there you run into battery drainage, so that’s definitely a trade-off.)
If your volume controls don’t work.
If you can’t silence your cell phone.
If you shatter your screen.
Tap the accessibility button once and then tap “Device.” If your phone is currently on silent, you’ll see a bell icon with a line through it. Tap that to “Unmute” your phone. (If your phone it not silenced, you’ll see the reverse.) Fair warning: If you use this hack, you’ll no longer be able to tell if your ringer is on by looking at the toggle on the side of your phone, so proceed with caution.
The only feeling worse than picking up your phone to discover the glass is totally shattered is the feeling of tiny shards of said glass lacerating your fingers and the side of your face whenever you use your now-ruined phone. Do yourself a favor and cut a piece of clear packing tape to fit over the entire screen (be sure to cut holes for the speaker and camera) to hold the broken pieces in place. We don’t recommend this as a permanent fix, and it totally depends on the severity of the cracking, but at the very least it’ll buy you some time and you won’t be picking Gorilla Glass out of your index finger for weeks to come.
Last July, three men working on the YouTube channel Trollstation (great name) pretended to rob multiple art galleries in London, running around with stockings to hide their faces and holding fake paintings. Another two, according to The Guardian, “took a speaker system that let off alarm sounds” into a gallery and filmed panicking visitors.
Four of those men — Daniel Jarvis, Ebenezer Mensah, Helder Gomes, and Endrit Ferizolli — were sentenced to jail terms ranging from 16 to 20 weeks after admitting to “two counts of using threatening or abusive words and behaviour causing fear of unlawful violence” in London court today.
Trollstation (again, a perfect name indicative of quality) claims to be the United Kingdom’s most popular prank channel with 718,000 subscribers. Throughout the day, the group has been retweeting people angry about the verdict.
The fifth man, Danh Van Le, had been sentenced to 24 weeks in Jail back in March for another YouTube prank in which a minor dropped ticking suitcases next to people waiting at a bus stop in order to make them panic.
It’s been a solid five months since the internet lost its collective marbles trying to find the stupid panda in a sea of snowmen, so it seems about time for a new optical illusion to sweep the web.
Do you see it? No? That’s okay. We can go get eye exams together.
In case you’re still in the dark, look closely at the seam between the second and third layer of bricks from the top. Still lost? There is a partially burned cigar shoved horizontally in there. Isn’t the internet great?
Well, here it is: a picture of a mysterious brick wall that had me scratching my head until one of my colleagues took pity on me and made me feel like a complete idiot for not seeing IT in the first place.
The illusion made the rounds on Reddit a few months back, but it’s recirculating today in the One Direction Twitter-sphere (where we found it, obviously) and on Imgur.
Did you hear? Code is dead. There’s no more code. If you were learning to code, you screwed up. Less than a year ago, Bloomberg was answering the question of “What is code?” and now we don’t even need it anymore.
Jason Tanz writes:
Large companies are already doing this, and the thing that has gone unmentioned in Tanz’s piece is that, well, only large companies can do this. Machine learning has been making strides in recent years “thanks in part to the rise of deep neural networks, massively distributed computational systems that mimic the multilayered connections of neurons in the brain.” That requires large data sets and a lot of physical resources — you can’t run a neural network from your phone. The implication is, then, that if this new type of code-less computer programming makes programming accessible to everyone, it is because Google or Facebook or Microsoft, or whoever, is providing the infrastructure to do so.
The latest installment in Wired’s series of bold proclamations claims that increasingly capable artificial intelligence and machine learning signal the end of computer programming in its current state. (In 2010, the magazine announced that the web is dead, which was mostly a semantic dodge about how the web is just a subsection of the internet.)
Tanz is correct that machine learning is a new (for most people) and exciting way for humans to interact with computers. Instead of requiring coding knowledge, programs, functions, and algorithms can be improved more or less by training them. (Probably worth acknowledging here that this sort of “black box” coaching — in which the instructor cannot predict the program’s behavioral outcome with 100-percent certainty — is also very worrying.)
Silicon Valley is often built on the myth of some schmucks in a garage. Apple was launched in a garage, as was Google, as was HP. Most of these myths are falsehoods, but the notion that one or two people with grand ideas and enough coding skill can change the world and “disrupt” old ways still pervades. Wired’s conception of the end of code is also the end of a tech industry that doesn’t require substantial amounts of capital, physical space, and back-end hardware to simply get off the ground.
So, yes, more people might be able to create and “train” computer programs without any knowledge of coding required, but they’ll be doing it on the backs of the organizations that have built and control these neural networks.
Which brings up a further point: Who constructs and maintains these supposedly revolutionary neural networks? The answer is developers and engineers — people who possess the sort of specialized computer know-how that Wired argues will soon be a thing of the past. That’s not eradicating code as we know it; that’s sending it one level deeper into bureaucratic obfuscation. If Wired is right, machine learning will reduce the number of people who know how to code, but, at the same time, it will make those who do even more powerful.
It’s a pen-shaped 3D printer, and it only costs $139. Not bad if you’ve got the skills to make some of this stuff with it.
Grand Central Terminal, with its iconic clock and infamously inverted ceiling constellations, is a thing of beauty. It’s also often crowded, loud, and walking through it puts you at serious risk of accidentally being bludgeoned to death by teen with a selfie stick. Instead, why not just stay at home and watch it on Facebook? (That’s what Facebook would want you to do.)
The video, titled Here and Now, was shot by Facebook’s in-house creative team, The Factory, and is the first video they’ve created using the company’s new Surround 360 camera, the Verge reports. It’s designed to be watched on Samsung’s Gear VR headset, but it’ll also work in your standard browser.
The whole thing lasts just three and a half minutes and was shot entirely during Grand Central’s off-hours (2:00 a.m. to 5:30 a.m.), so everyone in it — tourists taking selfies, moms and dads getting lost, drug-sniffing dogs — is an actor. It feels just like the real thing. Except not.
This afternoon, in a rather more graphic attempt to recapture exploding-watermelon fever, BuzzFeed livestreamed a surgery on Facebook. So as people on the East Coast were getting lunch, the site went live on Facebook with the graphic video of a skin lift and chest reduction, performed on a man who had recently lost 270 pounds. By my count this puts us … 18 months away from a Facebook Live execution?
It was gripping, in a car-crash way, but at 26,000 viewers didn’t quite hit the audience level of the rubber-banded watermelon. More interesting is the question of why Facebook finds this sort of (undeniably interesting, to some people!) thing permissible while, in the year 2016, women are still getting their accounts suspended for showing a nipple. Even historical photos from non-Western cultures are coming under fire. As of now, Facebook’s community guidelines (reminder: rules that affect 1.5 billion people) state that “We also restrict some images of female breasts if they include the nipple.”
To recap, female nipples in most situations: bad. Male nipples graphically, surgically removed on livestream: A-okay.
Here’s a great way to seem totally not creepy to a person you find attractive: The next time some guy or gal catches your eye on the subway, don’t say hi. Instead, snap a picture of them and upload it to a facial recognition app and find out exactly who they are and where they live and what they like to eat for breakfast before reaching out to the person. (Who, remember now, has no idea who you are! Fun!)
Of course, facial recognition technology, and the potential for controversy surrounding it, isn’t anything new. Facebook’s ability to recognize and tag your friends in photos has gotten astoundingly good in recent years, and the company has run into issues for storing “faceprints,” or data based on users’ faces. (It’s worth noting here that FindFace’s founders say that their software does not work with Facebook.) And, for years, the NSA has been collecting “millions” of selfies from the web to improve its facial-recognition databases.
This is just one way to use FindFace, a Russian facial recognition app that uses VKontakte (think Russian/former USSR Facebook with 200,000,000 active accounts) as an image data base by running profile pictures against submitted images. The app’s founders boast that it is 70 percent accurate and, in just two months, has grown to include 500,000 users, The Guardian reports. The Moscow government is currently closing a deal with FindFace to use the program to support the city’s existing security camera system.
FindFace can also be used to find people who look like other people you might be interested in. “So you could just upload a photo of a movie star you like, or your ex, and then find 10 girls who look similar to her and send them messages,” FindFace co-founder Alexander Kabakov told The Guardian. (If you used FindFace on me right now, the first match would be 🤔, the skeptical emoji.)
But there’s something about this particular nexus of surveillance state and social media that feels like a bridge too far, or even farther. Perhaps it’s the way FindFace is being marketed as a dating (read: stalking) app and is readily accessible to anybody with a smartphone. Or that its only been around for two months and has already been used by “online vigilantes to uncover the social media profiles of female porn actors and harass them.”
The Super Bowl is no stranger to viral moments, and is often, in fact, primed for them. This year was no different. Coldplay was leading the halftime show, joined by Beyoncé — who had just released her first single in two years, “Formation” — and consummate showman Bruno Mars.
Eli Manning had just remembered that bees are dying globally at an alarming rate.
Yet even the combined star power of three of music’s hottest acts could not overtake a moment toward the end of the game, in which television cameras caught the Manning family celebrating Denver quarterback Peyton’s imminent victory. The only one not celebrating was Eli Manning, Peyton’s brother and quarterback for the New York Giants. As the rest of his family yelled and high-fived, Eli just stared ahead vacantly, almost in shock, as if he had just been blindsided by some horrible truth.
The fact that the global population of bees, which pollinate a significant portion of our fresh produce, is decreasing substantially has become a meme.
Bees have a storied history when it comes to internet-friendly nonsense jokes. Among a certain demographic, simply saying the word “beads” online will summon this GIF, similar to how saying “Bloody Mary” three times in the mirror will summon a murderous ghost.
Oprah releasing the bees, taken from an episode of Conan, is also a popular GIF response.
On Tumblr, the crappy Jerry Seinfeld animated film Bee Movie has found an ironic fandom whose members show one another affection by posting the film script in its entirety.
We could spend many hours, I think, mapping the cultural psycho-geography of bees. They are by turns cute and threatening; domesticated, food-generating insects that can quite literally kill humans; colorful carriers of both sweetness and poison. Also, the word “bees” is, just, funny. Bees! A wonderful Politico headline from April 2015 reads, matter-of-factly, “’Bees are good,’ Obama says as children scream.”
Bees’ peculiar cultural valence is only heightened by the crisis they (and we) now face: For the past decade or so, scientists have been warning the public about colony collapse disorder, described by the Environmental Protection Agency as “the phenomenon that occurs when the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear and leave behind a queen, plenty of food and a few nurse bees to care for the remaining immature bees and the queen.”
Which might explain why, in the last few months, the text string “bees are dying globally at an alarming rate” is appearing more and more frequently on social media. One of the first recent tweets to use the global bee die-off as a punch line, albeit in slightly altered form, appeared last September during the Pope’s visit to the United States, when @topshelftyson posted:
The EPA adds, however, that “Once thought to pose a major long-term threat to bees, reported cases of CCD have declined substantially over the last five years.” But as someone who receives the Google News digest for the search query “bees” every morning, I can tell you that our collective worry about the global bee population has not subsided. Colony collapse disorder is not the only possible culprit for why bee populations are in flux. The big specter looming over the hives? Climate change.
The gag truly took off at the end of the year when @SlimiHendrix turned the phrase into a photo meme, demonstrating the creeping existential dread of bees dying globally at an alarming rate.
The thing I love about bees dying globally at an alarming rate (the meme, not the ecological trend) is that it captures an entire process, not just a single emotion. We usually cathect memes with single, categorical emotions and reactions: confusion, triumph, anger, disappointment. Few capture the full host of feeling that “bees dying” does, the rise and fall of emotion felt when you remember that bees are dying globally at an alarming rate.
As a meme sensation, sudden existential anxiety is not new. One need only remember @BAKKOOONN’s famous tweet of a corgi by a pond to see the same character arc.
But “bees” approaches more than just regret. It is the full experience of angst; the existential vertigo one experiences at the summits of the Anthropocene. It is no coincidence that “bees dying” appears most frequently with images of people enjoying the full fruits of cultural and industrial modernity. Bees are dying at an alarming rate, and possibly because of manmade climate change; their demise might make growing the food we eat impossible. We have constructed a cultural life that forces the pressing questions of the environment and food supply outside of our field of view, and abdicated our own responsibilities to nature in favor of unsustainable, constant stimulation. What can we, as individuals, do to save the bees? The answers are unclear.
What is clear, however, is that at some point, you will find yourself in a good place — spiritually, emotionally, maybe even physically — and just as you start to think it can’t get any better, you will remember: “bees are dying globally at an alarming rate.”
Texting is great, but there are only so many times you can send the crap emoji before you realize that there’s just something … missing. If you really want to spice things up, for $170 you can buy a snazzy device called a Cyrano that emits different scents when you message your friends.
Or you could save yourself several hundred dollars and light a Yankee Candle before you start texting or listening to music. The choice is yours.
Produced by Vapor Communications, Cyrano is described as a “digital scent speaker and mood modification platform.” It works with an app, oNotes, which lets users choose when, and which scents, the device releases. Options range from pine and peppermint to suntan lotion and Bellinis. The device itself costs $150 and the scent packs cost an additional $20.
Scents are released in short bursts, which Vapor Communications says help stave off “the olfactory fatigue associated with traditional scent technology, such as candles and air fresheners.” (Okay. Sure.) The device can be programmed to release smells in conjunction with your music library. (May we suggest “Smells Like Teen Spirit.”) You can also use Cyrano without the app as, basically, a glorified and very pricey air freshener. And if you and a friend both have one, you can send each other scented messages. (Nothing says “LOL” like the fresh smell of pine trees, am I right?)
It’s often exciting when two celebrities meet. Will their egos clash, or will they get along like best friends? Who knows!
Well, here’s your answer.
Yesterday, two of YouTube’s most top celebrities — the hydraulic press, famous for crushing various objects on its eponymous channel, and the red-hot nickel ball, famous for melting through various objections on the channel “carsandwater” — met for the first time. Finally, an answer the question that many of us wondered but were too afraid to ask: what happens when you crush a nickel ball in a hydraulic press?
Yesterday, an 18-month-old YouTube video about Annandale, Virginia, climbed to the top of Reddit for some reason, bringing it the vast majority of its now-over-a-million views.
Those who clicked through were presented with a riveting 96 seconds of tautly constructed cinema:
As with so much great art, the underlying “message” is hard to decipher at first. Perhaps the film isn’t supposed to “say” anything in the traditional sense.
I’m curious whether your thoughts on the place have changed since you published the video. Is it still a shithole? Have you found peace living there, or have you moved elsewhere?Thanks! I still live in this shithole. But I have a realtor helping me find a place and plan on moving. I just try and stay busy while I still live in this garbage house and not focus on the neighborhood or my crappy roommates or landlord.
That creator’s name is Angelo Mike, or FlyingOverTr0ut on YouTube, and I was curious whether, and to what extent, his feelings about Annandale had changed since the video went up in September 2014. What follows is a short, lightly edited email interview:
What advice would you give a young person who is set on moving to Annandale for work or a relationship?Oh man, I have no idea. I’m not good at giving advice. I’m lucky to have YouTube as an outlet, most people probably don’t have anything like that and might be living in a bad situation. The way you look at things changes the things you look at. So if you think there’s no opportunities to be found, you will find that to be true, because the story you narrate to yourself each time an opportunity is waiting to be turned over is that it won’t work, so don’t even try.
But taken together, a series of clues drawn from the video’s title (“Welcome Home to the Shithole of Annandale, VA”); the stoically delivered narration (“This miserable ashtray of a town soaked with urine … Annandale has dutifully functioned as a funnel for the dregs of society from the rest of Virginia … the cozy, numbing sight of people who have given up on their lives all around you”); and the striking images of filth, ruin, and a dead rat, point the viewer — the discerning viewer, at least — to the conclusion that the creator of the video probably does not like Annandale, Virginia.
But that’s easier said than done. Like I said, I really don’t know. Read [Holocaust survivor and existential psychoanalyst] Viktor Frankl, he gave better advice than I ever could.
Thanks. Last question: What is your favorite thing about Annandale?

Say what you will about kids these days, but the fact that teens are constantly plugged into cell phones is the best thing that has happened to viral internet content since dental anesthesia.
To the uninitiated, the section of Twitter inhabited by teenage girls is a strange place full of prom pictures labeled #Goals, heart-eyed cat emoji, and accounts with massive followings and handles like @teenagernotes and @girlposts sharing nearly identical “relatable” content cribbed (often without attribution) from other people’s social accounts. Every once in a while, though, a nugget of pure viral gold is sifted from the dirt.
It’s hard to think of a formerly essential device that’s been as thoroughly replaced as the alarm clock. I’m not sure I know anyone anymore who has an actual, physical alarm clock on their bedside table, when even just ten years ago, before the ascendance of the smartphone, it was an essential bit of tech. People still have cameras; they still wear watches; but the smartphone has more or less completely replaced the alarm clock. It shouldn’t have.
And, face it: Your phone also has no charm whatsoever. Clocks — most of them at any rate — are a really very lovely objects: soothing in their predictability and reliability, comforting in the singularity and simplicity of their purpose, and, in some cases, very well designed. Replacing all the many possibilities of the alarm clock — Digital! Analog! Bright colors! Simple minimalism! Flippy-floppy numbers, you know those ones! — for a black rectangle of a screen laid flat on its back is an abdication.
Also, to see the time on a phone you have to pull out the phone and check it. With an alarm clock you can look at the clock. This is a nice feature.
I’ll admit that I have a thing for clocks. It would not be very difficult for any first-year psychology student to figure out why; I am late for literally everything, all the time, and constantly suffer just enough anxiety about it to feel bad but not enough to get me to actually change my behavior. I keep an extensive collection of watches, almost all Swatch-brand plastic watches of mostly ridiculous patterns and colors from the late 1980s.
And no matter how good my smartphone, no matter how good the Rock’s alarm clock app is, I will not use my phone as an alarm clock. I use an alarm clock as an alarm clock.
It’s true that phones make very good alarm clocks. They can wake you up at any time, obey any pattern of complex wake-up times, play any song or tone. You’re already carrying one around in your pocket, and probably looking at it before bed.
But it’s also very likely bad for your sleeping habits to use your phone as an alarm clock. Most obviously, it’s been well documented that the cool, bright light of a smartphone screen makes it much harder to go to sleep; it stands to reason that if you’re using your phone as an alarm clock you’re much more likely to be using it before bed. But there are also so-called “sleep hygiene” reasons to keep your phone out of your bedroom: the stimulation of flicking through your phone — and of keeping emails from your boss only an arm’s length away all night — is only going to make it harder to relax yourself enough to sleep.
One of the nicest things about alarm clocks is that there’s no “best”: They do basically one thing, and most of them do it well enough that your choice is really about personality. (The most popular are often the least interesting: Amazon’s best seller is a boring-ass black rectangle with big red numbers.) If you want one, I highly recommend venturing deep into eBay, Craigslist, or Etsy to find killer, weird alarm clocks: baroque 1950s filigreed silver things that bang little bells, fake-wood-paneled 1970s radio-alarm clocks that feel as though they should play Creedence Clearwater Revival songs and nothing else; minimalist Braun cubes for your mid-century-inspired condo; cartoonish brightly colored Memphis-design-inspired clocks from the 1980s.
Here are a few of my favorites, just to get you started.
This clock is so rad I might actually buy it myself. It has that Marimekko kind of childlike look that pairs so well with the boring minimalist mid-century furniture that’s trendy now. Also the seller refers to the clock as “he,” which rules.

I had this same GE clock when I was a kid, and am just realizing now that it was probably 20 years old when I had it. How did I even get this thing? Incredibly fake-looking wood paneling, big freakin’ snooze button, can wake you up to FM radio. You may have to Google what the FM stations are near you.
Braun Classic Alarm Clock, Amazon, $25.57
Ah yes, the Braun alarm clock. Classic, clean, simple. This clock tells the world that style is important to you but not enough to get something that isn’t appealing to literally everyone in the world.
Love the color, love the flippity-floppity numbers, love that there’s a little window that shows you what time the alarm is set for.

Today, I present Cullen Melton, a teenager whose failed attempts to shoot a basketball have gone viral, thanks to a Twitter video shared by his friend Joel Dillis. Dillis first posted the video at the end of April, but it has resurfaced again online this week to the tune of 72,000 retweets (and counting.)
Melton might not have sunk the shot, but Dillis at least scores a few bonus points for adding the dramatic slow-motion effect. That’s friendship right there.

Making the rounds today are several pictures of insane diary entries scribbled in pink pen from a now-16-year-old Utah high school student, Madie, who says she wrote the notes when she was in second grade back in 2008. In them, she chronicles a heartbreaking saga from her younger years involving her crush, Riley, and their classmate, Jessica, who has stolen Riley’s attention. (The drama. The drama!)
As a standalone bit, Madie’s story (which has already been retweeted over 11,000 times from her personal account alone) has all the makings of an decent rom-com: unrequited love, Valentine’s Day, a possible crime of passion. But I remained unconvinced that the a 7-year-old had actually lived, much less penned, such a dramatic and mature plot line, not to mention one that hits such beloved internet punch lines as “diapers” and “semi-ironic misandry.” (This may shock you, but you can’t believe everything you read on the internet these days.) Skeptical, I contacted, via Twitter, as many of the players as I could to find out more.
In the hopes of luring Riley away from Jessica — who “hugs at least five boys every day” and is “such a player” (again, remember this was supposedly written when Madie was, um, 7) — Madie writes that she has decided to break the rules of feminism and tell Riley about Jessica’s “big secret” … Jessica still wears a diaper. (Harsh move, Madie.)
First up, Madie told me she has very vivid memories of spending Valentine’s Day 2008 “bawling,” and that the whole thing definitely happened. “I honestly don’t think I could ever make up something up this funny,” Madie reasoned.
Her older sister, Katelyn, told me about making the valentine for Riley. “I had the idea to make an origami box and fill it with chocolates for him. It took hours for us to completely finish and decorate the box,” she said. (Katelyn recalls the box being “white with stickers and hearts all over it,” while Madie says it was “blue,” but we’ll give them the benefit of the doubt on that discrepancy since this whole thing happened eight years ago and I can’t remember what I ate for breakfast today.)
And finally, Jessica, the former diaper-wearer herself admitted the anecdote was about her. “I remember dating Riley,” she told me. (When I asked what “dating” meant back then, she cited playground hand-holding and after-school phone calls.) Jessica also said her friends at school (she and Madie no longer live in the same town or state) have all seen the diary tweet, an experience she calls “mortifying, but very funny.”
The only person I couldn’t track down was our leading man, Riley. (Katelyn told me he’s not on social media: “[W]e looked, but the only thing we found was a picture of him on Facebook that someone else posted.”) So for now, we’ll just assume he’s still breaking hearts and laying the groundwork for some excellent viral tweets in the future.
Anyone looking for something similar from Google’s I/O developer conference this afternoon would have come away disappointed. It’s not that the announcements were a bust. The company unveiled a lot of neat stuff. But “neat” is the right word: nothing surprising, nothing game-changing, nothing mind-boggling, nothing bad. Just, you know, neat: Pleasant new apps for chatting over text and video, an Amazon Echo–like speaker called Home, a new-virtual reality headset, and a bunch of new tech specs for developers to pore over regarding Android. The tech talk was boring if you are a consumer and not a developer, but guess what: It’s a developer conference. So it goes.
This is because, unlike Facebook, Google has spent the last two decades parsing user queries and requests. Using Facebook, browsing your news feed, clicking interesting links, and reading status updates, are mostly passive experiences. The News Feed algorithm delivers things to you without any initial input. Googling, on the other hand, is an active task, querying the search engine for specific bits of info, maybe rewording your search term if you’re not getting results. Those 20 years of data-gathering and experience give Google a lengthy head start on operations like determining the context of a given request (essential to when users deliver vague or terse voice commands).
And that’s just fine for Google. Demos for Google Assistant and Google Home, the two products leading off the event, showed people conversing with their phones and Bluetooth speakers pretty naturally — changing reservations, turning on lights, and translating text. Granted: Bots always break once unleashed upon the greater populace, but we have every reason to believe that Google’s AI will function well.
You can already see some of this in action, as in Inbox, the Gmail client that can automatically deduce when you’ve booked a flight and add it to your calendar, or realize when you’ve placed an order and track the package. But it’s still most obvious in Google’s core product: Search. If you search for a movie on Google, the service pulls local showtimes automatically. It assumes that when a user queries for a recent film, the context is that they want to go see it.
The truth is, developer conferences like I/O, Facebook’s F8, and Apple’s famous WWDC, are getting less and less exciting every year. At the scale of the Fearsome Five of tech, the industry is fairly predictable: Each company has some kind of VR product; each company has some kind of chat-and-video messaging app; each company has some stake in the coming driverless-car revolution. And each company has a bot, or many. The current running beneath I/O was artificial intelligence — one of the handful of sectors on which the Fearsome Five have converged to compete for what could be enormous future growth.
Other personal assistants, like Amazon’s Echo and Apple’s Siri, are somewhat less functional. They tend to rely on third-party stores of information like Wikipedia — and, uh, Google — to serve up necessary data. Facebook is much better at knowing specific things about its users, but it’s still ill-equipped to determine what they want in specific instances. For a long time, as an example, if you changed your status from “In a relationship” to “Single,” Facebook could determine that you were single — a useful data point for advertisers — but not that you had gone through a breakup. Its News Feed algorithm still regularly delivered users updates on their ex, because the context wasn’t taken into account.
But you’d be stupid to count Google out. Google’s never been able to make hardware (or even operating systems) that really compete with Apple; its attempts at Facebook-like social networks have failed many times now. But it’s still really goddamn good at one thing: taking the words users type into a text box, making sense of them, and giving users back what they want. The current trend of chatbots and conversational UI is perfect for Google because, since 1998, Google’s been trying to figure out what the hell it is you’re asking for. Unlike other platforms, it has the necessary tools to answer.
Google, with its goofy logo and name, has never really been a flashy tech company. On the product level it’s always lacked the showmanship or salesmanship of Facebook or Apple, especially recently, as a surging Facebook has made a series of splashy announcements about its investments in hip new technology — VR! Bots! A monstrous drone-based wireless network!
Facebook’s entry into the bot universe is unquestionably a play for some of Google’s market share — in search, in commerce, in the great nebulous world of “asking for things online.” It’s not just that AI has finally reached a level of advancement to make it feasible in a chatbot product, it’s that Google’s rivals sense the company’s potential weakness as users transition to a mobile, app-based internet.
Today is day one of Google’s annual I/O developer conference, which means a lot of nerds hanging out at the company’s campus in Mountain View and listening to other nerds talk.
The next day, which just happens to be Valentine’s Day, Madie gifts Riley a handmade valentine (she and her sister stayed up late making it) which he promptly throws into the garbage, sending Madie home in tears. (Sad!) The following day, Riley declares his affections for Jessica, prompting Madie to declare, “I am done with boys. I want to kill all of them” to her diary. (See her illustration below.)
At the keynote, the company introduced a new video-calling app called Duo, a one-to-one messaging app that feels very reminiscent of, say, Apple’s FaceTime, but with one notable difference. Google’s app has a feature called Knock Knock, which shows you a live video feed of the person calling before you pick up. So if your friend Chad is calling to tell you he is being mauled by a bear, you’ll be able to see Chad running from said bear, which might affect your decision to, you know, pick up.
The app isn’t available for download yet, but Google says it’s designed to work across Android and Apple devices (another thing Duo has over FaceTime, since the Apple equivalent doesn’t run on Android) and should be ready this summer.
“Spontaneous and fun,” Google says of its newest feature. “Eh, sure why not,” we say.
If your Facebook feed is anything like mine, earlier this week it was inundated with pictures of a small child covered in vomit. (Facebook, if you’re listening, please feel free to suppress such pictures in the future. They’re gross.)
The head of the Uber ATC, John Bares, gave Pittsburgh a backhanded review when telling the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review why he enjoyed testing in the city:
Uber announced this morning that, over the next few weeks, it will begin testing its much-anticipated autonomous vehicles on the streets of Pittsburgh. The model, a Ford Fusion hybrid, was developed by the company’s Advanced Technologies Center (which you might recall is now staffed by former Carnegie Mellon researchers after Uber raided their robotics lab).
“Driving in Pittsburgh is a living nightmare, an ordeal like summiting the forbidding peaks of the Himalayas. Only a city as inhospitable as Pittsburgh can truly test our coming robot-car army.” —Uber
The sensor on top of Uber’s car is equipped with 22 large lenses and a series of spinning lasers, allowing the car to see 100 meters in any direction.
The demo appears to have gone off without a hitch. As a safety mechanism, the vehicle emits a loud beep whenever it gets stumped and needs the human driver monitoring the car to take over.
It’s a pretty funny story and thousands of people shared Patterson’s post on Facebook. Except, as it turns out, the police were never actually involved. Patterson has since updated his original Facebook post saying “the part about the police coming and the breathalyzer was just something I added for dramatic effect for my wife in the moment.”
“When I realized this thing has gone viral, I went down to apologize to them [the local police department] and say I didn’t want this to reflect badly on them,” Patterson told me. “At first they thought I was there to complain, but once they realized what was going on we all had a good laugh about it.”
So while the story isn’t quite as incredible when you take out the attempted arrest, there’s still that whole baby looking sad covered in vomit thing to laugh at. (Or, as Patterson put it, baby going “Exorcist in the car.”) Ultimately, Patterson says he just wanted to make his wife laugh. And we just want to rigorously report out viral Facebook memes. Looks like everyone won.
The photos were shared by California dad Ben Patterson, part of a long string of very funny text messages he’d sent his wife after turning around in the car to find their son, Declan, had barfed all over himself. As the texts go, Patterson says he pulled over to clean his son but was so overwhelmed by the stench, he started puking on the spot. (The spot being a random woman’s lawn.) The cops were called and Patterson told his wife he was forced to take a Breathalyzer test to prove he wasn’t drunk, before driving home with the windows open. (Wow. Parenting sounds fun.)

The Internet of Things promises to make our home lives as simple (“simple”) as our digital lives. Soon, every home appliance (maybe even your couch) while have a Wi-Fi- or Bluetooth-connected chip inside, so you can control it from your smartphone. Imagine sending a tweet from your fridge. Guess what! You already can.
But in some cases, I’m more than happy to hand over my devices to the internet. I love the idea of this stupid-as-hell bottle opener, the BOx. It encapsulates the wonder of the Internet of Things in its near-uselessness. (The BOx does not actually exist yet. Its inventors are launching a Kickstarter tomorrow.)
As you can imagine, I think this seems extraordinarily, uhh, shortsighted. I don’t want all of my appliances — let alone my furniture or tools — to suddenly drop to the level of reliability of my wireless router.
The idea of the BOx is that it has a chip inside that pairs with your smartphone and messages your friends whenever you open a bottle. That’s … pretty much it.
Once you open a bottle, BOx uses its proprietary algorithm to alert friends over Slack and Facebook Messenger. “The ‘Smart Cheers’ algorithm,” according to the site’s copy, “uses time, location, frequency, and other factors blended in with our own special sauce to keep your friends updated wherever they are!”
No joke, I would love to get a push notification from a bottle opener, and then I’d probably reply with something like “Nice” or “😎👌.” An early-warning system for brewskis — 2016 rules.
There are also leader boards, in case you are interested in tracking how many beers you drink and then looking at the grand total — collected by a bottle opener with a Wi-Fi chip inside — and reevaluating your life.
In what seems like a counterintuitive way to save money, you’ll soon be able to spend your hard-earned dollars on a wearable engineered to shock you if overspend.
It’s an … interesting (read: semi-terrifying) concept as far as wearable tech is concerned, but as somebody who has both purchased a Fitbit and borrowed an Apple Watch (from a friend with a higher “Tech I Don’t Really Need” budget) only to promptly abandon both, I can’t see myself spending nearly $200 and strapping something to my wrist purely in the hopes of sparing my savings account (which is now $200 in the red after buying the stupid thing). But, hey, different strokes for different folks. Or, um, shocks, as it were.
Designed by British tech company Intelligent Environments, the strange feature is designed to work with the Pavlok, an existing wearable that shocks users to help them beat bad habits like nail biting.
Users connect the device to their credit card or bank and set a spending limit. When they exceed it, the device shocks them with force ranging from “pleasant to slightly uncomfortable,” The Guardian reports. While the Pavlok is currently available for purchase (a steal at $179), the banking feature has not yet been made available to the public.
Other than the company’s notoriously lax attitude about background checks, allegations of drivers kidnapping and raping riders, and that, um, interesting new logo, the worst thing about Uber is surge pricing. And, not surprisingly, the company has figured out exactly when you are more likely to pay double or triple the cost of your ride: when your phone battery is low.
Chen called it an “interesting kind of psychological fact of human behavior,” and promised that the company is not using that data to gouge riders. Which is good for me, (and the 15 percent of American adults who use ride-hailing apps) because my battery is constantly in a state of “if I turn the back-light all the way down and don’t run any other apps I might MIGHT be able to send one more tweet before my phone dies.”
Uber’s head of economic research, Keith Chen, recently told NPR’s Shankar Vedantam on an episode of The Hidden Brain podcast that people are willing to accept up to 9.9 times surge pricing (ouch) if their phones are about to go dead. Data about user batteries is collected because the app uses that information to know when to switch into low-power mode. The idea being: If you really need to get where you’re going, you’ll pay just about anything (or at least 9.9 times anything) to ensure you’re getting a ride home and won’t be stranded. A person with a more fully charged device has time to wait and see if the surge pricing goes down.
You spent too much on your phone.
Also, just to be clear, we’re not talking about the dreaded crapphone here — the sub-$200, maybe-it-works class of okay devices. Crapphones are great and handy when you break your real phone and need a placeholder, but below we’re looking at handsets you’d actually be happy with day to day.
Dishing out for the highest-end phones used to make sense, even as recently as a couple of years ago. Your phone company subsidized the cost in exchange for a two-year contract, and frankly, anything but the best phones weren’t very good. Then the contracts died (replaced by those installment plans, which, bonus point, you should also avoid if you can afford to pay up-front), cheap phones went from sort of bad to pretty great, and suddenly spending close to four figures on a phone became downright wasteful.
Ultimately, it’s your money. Spend it how you want! But if you want to spend it smart, here are a few phones that get the job done for about half of what you spent on your last iPhone.
I’m sorry! I know it may not seem like it, since you broke it into wee monthly payments that get lumped in with your data plan on your credit card. But that maxed-out iPhone 6S Plus still put you back more than a thousand bucks, with tax. That’s rent money, man.
Aha! You thought this was going to be a bunch of Android phones you’ve never heard of, didn’t you? That’s okay! Until a few weeks ago, it would have been. Fortunately, Apple recently resurrected its smaller phone form factor in the iPhone SE, a boon for small hands and small budgets alike.
The iPhone SE still isn’t cheap, exactly; it starts at $400, but you’ll probably be happier with the $500 version that has four times the storage. There’s a lot to like, though, and that shrinkage doesn’t mean many compromises compared to the much pricier iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. The SE has a great camera and marathon battery life, and doesn’t need two hands to navigate. It’s not just cheaper; for a lot of people, it’ll actually be better.
iPhone SE, Apple, $400
Google’s Nexus lineup exists to show off the best that Android can offer. It comprises two smartphones: the Nexus 6P, which is bigger and starts at $500, and Nexus 5X, which at $350 is the Platonic ideal of “definitely good enough” phone.
What’s great about the 5X is that it’s good enough at everything that you never find yourself secretly wishing it would fall in the toilet and die a watery death. It’s fast; it’s got a great camera, a solid display, a manageable size; and it comes unlocked, which means you can use it no matter what carrier you have.
Most of all, though, this is the phone I recommend to people when they ask me what they should buy. That’s partly because I’m frugal, but mostly because I know it won’t disappoint.
If you’re anxious about using Android, all I can say is that it’s gotten a lot better. It’s very good! Better than iOS in lots of ways, even, although your mileage will vary depending on how many other Apple devices you have in your life and how you use them.
Nexus 5X, Amazon, $329.44
Remember what I just said about under-$200 phones being a nonstarter? That was a lie, and I’m sorry. There’s one exception to that rule, and it’s the Moto G.
The one piece of advice on the Moto G is that you should hold off on buying one for a minute. This week, Motorola just announced the next generation of Moto Gs (plural, there are three of them for some reason), but not when they’ll hit the U.S. or how much they’ll cost. Assuming it’s still at least moderately cheap-ish, the one you’ll want is the Moto G Plus, which bulks up the camera — one of the few things you shouldn’t skimp on if you can help it.
Think of the Moto G as the base-level trim Camry of the smartphone world. Okay, that’s not exactly a slogan you’d put on a billboard. But the Moto G is what happens when you strip away anything that could be considered an extra feature — NFC, a 1080p display, a giant display — and make a phone that just works, for cheap. It’s not, you know, exciting. But if you’re looking for excitement from your phone, it might be time to hit up a ropes course or something. Fresh air, you know? Does wonders.
Moto G, Amazon, $165 (but you might want to wait)
One reason budget phones have caught up to their more expensive counterparts? The ceiling rises a little slower every year. Flagship devices get a little faster, maybe the battery lasts a little longer, and they might have some new gimmick (like, say, the iPhone 6S “3D Touch” powers you forgot existed until now), but there’s just not that much difference between an iPhone 6 and an iPhone 6S, or a Galaxy S6 and a Galaxy S7. They even look, if not exactly identical, basically the same.
To avoid disappointment and pain, I’d avoid eBay or Craigslist when seeking out a like-new smartphone. Look instead at refurbished models from a reseller like Gazelle, or even Amazon, which has a whole “Certified Refurbished” electronics store that offers like-new, warranty-protected gear (like iPhones) for cheap.
You’ll still spend more than you would on a strictly budget phone. But it’s the best way to save a little cash without a lot of compromises.
So why not hit up the discount rack? You can still buy an iPhone 6 from Apple for a hundred bucks less than a 6S, or, if you want to really save some cash, it’s incredibly easy to find a gently used model. And that goes for pretty much any top brand.
Google’s new Allo messaging program, one of a handful of products and initiatives announced at this week’s I/O developer conference, has one neat gimmick: an artificial intelligence-driven response feature that analyzes a conversation and provides users with a selection of pre-written text replies. The software is meant to make texting easier — doing so, of course, by scanning and analyzing your entire history of texting and messaging within Allo, determining habits and patterns, and using visual-recognition software to predict how one might respond.
This predictive feature is becoming ubiquitous across Google’s products. Its newest email client, Inbox, features the same type of prepackaged responses and predictive text — generated, as in Allo, by extensively scanning and analyzing your emails. The company’s new Gboard keyboard for the iPhone similarly “remembers” what you type, and suggests words to you as you use it. (That data is — Google says — stored locally on your phone, and not sent to Google. Yet.)
Who is asking for this feature? “Another way Allo lets you express yourself is by typing less,” the developer demo-ing the app said. “A lot less.”
What? One-button responses make sense for quick acknowledgements — messages like “Okay” or “See you soon!” But do you really want to go back and forth with a contact the same way that you’d play an RPG? (“Yum clams!”) Apple briefly tried a less personalized approach to message prediction in an earlier version of iOS before quietly burying the feature. The feature has yet to overcome the slightly icky feeling that you’re letting a computer impersonate you. The line between computer as auxiliary helper and computer as an extension of the self is slowly but surely becoming blurred.
Or maybe the brands will start talking to you directly in your own tone and manner — or that of your friends. The rise of social media, and the sudden ability of institutions to connect directly with millions of people, has had a consequent rise in advertiser obsession with brand “authenticity.” What this means in practice is that major consumer brands take to Twitter and Facebook express themselves in stilted millennial-speak: “Our products are bae, and also woke.” What happens when they can run a program to generate individually targeted “authentic” messages? Denny’s can DM you and sound eerily like your best friend. Or like you.
Paul Salo wants to raise $1.5 million (though he’ll settle for $300,000) to purchase a condemned skyscraper and a plane, fly said plane directly into said skyscraper, and “prove 9/11 to be true or false once and for all.” Does this sound insane, not to mention incredibly insensitive? Yes? Good. It is.
And, meanwhile, Google is collecting an enormous amount of information about you — about how you chat and email your friends — ostensibly for a feature whose use cases are fairly small in number. So what else is going on?
I don’t mean to imply that Google is up to something insidious, only that large tech companies rarely develop these complex machine-learning systems to suit a single purpose. At this point everyone knows (I hope) that Google makes its money not by selling its enormously useful and well-made products and services, but by selling to advertisers the data collected through the use of those services.
Prior to getting shut down, Salo labeled his project “Mythbusters for September 11th.” Donation tiers included T-shirts for $125, pieces of rubble from the demolitions for $1,000, or a $5,000 front-row seat to the event.
Crowdfunding website Indiegogo appears to think so, too. The platform terminated Salo’s “September 11th Redux” fundraising campaign on Wednesday, a move Salo calls “very underhanded.”
“To be clear, I’m not a conspiracy theorist,” Salo explained in blog post on his website responding to the Indiegogo incident. “But aspects of the disaster are certainly tantalizing enough to want to see it recreated.” But apparently not so tantalizing that Salo wanted to put in the effort to truly re-create the horrific events of 9/11. As noted by The Daily Dot, Salo’s plan involved buying a 767, not a 747, and finding a building that was just “World Trade Center-like.”
So what do you do when you’ve got the data and the neural networks necessary to — theoretically — imitate an individual person’s conversational patterns? It’s not difficult to imagine ad-targeting on an even more personalized level than it is now. Instead of selecting for specific search terms or demographics, advertising copy could itself be personalized for each user, using the tone and colloquialisms specific to them. Do you often say “y’all” or deploy the laugh-cry emoji? Maybe you’ll start seeing them more often in the ads around your Google experience.
At this point, it’s just speculation: Google’s predictive tech isn’t even good enough to make it useful to most people, let alone advertisers; and it’s not clear that they have any plans at all to sell data like this to partners. But next time Google accurately guesses what you meant to type, you might wonder what else is going on in its enormous, distributed brain.
As of Wednesday, only 19 people had donated a total of $441 dollars, a far cry from the goal of $1.5 million. On YouTube, Salo writes he is still accepting donations and that he has recently “received interest from several large donors wanting to cover a significant percentage of our total goal. They are also very passionate and wanting this to succeed.” Sure, Paul.
Last week, professional internet-breaker Kim Kardashian said on her Snapchat story that she was over the regular puppy filter and casually mentioned wanting a dalmatian one instead. This week, Snapchat quietly released a new, double-dog filter, but it’s a little tricky to find. We’re not saying, we’re just saying.
Happy snapping! (Remember, filters come and go on a daily basis, so this one might disappear at some point.)
To use the filter, grab a friend and fire up Snapchat (the filter only works with two people). Tap the screen like you are taking a normal selfie with the dog filter, which now seems sad and boring compared to its spotted counterpart. Once you see the usual brown dog ears and nose on your face, have your friend get into the frame. A dalmatian filter will snap over their face.
It’s always nice to find a great deal. Sometimes you walk into Kohl’s expecting to return some clothing that doesn’t fit, and you end up finding something new, something exciting.
Which is all to say, Congratulations, Candace on finding this great Chewbacca mask. I’m sold.
Sometimes, the thing you find is so exciting that you immediately have to jump on Facebook Live and show your friends. And sometimes that livestream — a brief four minutes of rapturous joy — ends up getting viewed 28 million times, and shared another 847,000 times.
Technically, this has been around for a while, but it’s never a bad time to watch it. The video (which has been retweeted over 60,000 times from Samia’s account) is making the rounds again today thanks to a freebooted version on the /r/videos subreddit. And also because laughing at moms never gets old.
As likely Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump heads toward the general election, the chattering classes have turned to the pressing question: Who will be his running mate?
Back in February, Samia Hampstead filmed a short clip of her mother on Snapchat, using one of the app’s face-contorting filters. Her mother’s reaction was, well, it’s better if you just watch for yourself. (Make sure your sound is turned on.)
One dark-horse possibility: @Dril, the pseudoynmous, Jack Nicholson–avatared Weird Twitter hero/demigod. Dril’s arrival on the national scene several years ago spouting incoherent, libidinous, authoritarian comment-spam presaged — and, arguably, predicted — Trump’s success as a presidential candidate. It’s hard to think of a potential vice-president who would align so closely with Trump on core issues of national security, patriotism, and soda.
Don’t believe us? Look at how closely Trump and Dril line up when it comes to the issues facing real Americans.

Freedom of speech

A significant component of Uber’s business model revolves around surge pricing: As requests for cars go up, so can the price of a ride — in part to get more cabs on the road in the area. Surges can be influenced by things like the weather (the old it’s impossible to grab a cab in the rain mentality holds true even if you hail that cab through an app) or time and date (a ride home at 12:02 a.m. on New Year’s Day is going to cost you). Surge prices start at 1.1 times the cost of a standard ride and go up from there.
But, weirdly, the company says slight differences in surge prices determine whether or not riders will accept a higher fare. And for the rider it often means paying more. Uber’s head of economic research, Keith Chen, recently told NPR’s Shankar Vedantam on an episode of The Hidden Brain podcast that people are more likely to take a ride priced at 2.1 times regular cost than they are at 2.0.
According to Chen, if an Uber user opens the app to see 2x pricing, they’ll tend to think it’s “capricious and unfair,” a random price point “somebody just made … up.” Meanwhile, a ride priced at 2.1x feels logical, like there is a “smart algorithm in the background.” (Which there is, it’s just not an algorithm necessarily designed to benefit Uber users.)
Luckily for the rider, surge prices and requests for rides are inversely related (Chen notes that between 1x and 1.2x they see a drop of 27 percentage points in requests). If you can wait ten minutes and try again, you’ll usually find that the pricing will drop back down. Or, at the very least, you might be willing to accept a surge price set at a round number.
For the past week or so, Google — which, uh, I imagine you’re familiar with — and Oracle, an enormous but less flashy technology company, have been sparring in court over Google’s use of a version of Java, the programming language owned by Oracle, in its Android operating system. At the heart of the matter is the question of whether or not the Java API could be copyrighted, and whether Google’s use of it was exempt under fair use. In short, Oracle wants to know if it can get some cash because Google used a program it created.
When Google developed the first versions of Android during the ‘00s, Java was owned by Sun Microsystems, and its various forms were generally open source — meaning that developers could use open-source code in their own software and modify the code as they saw fit. The version Google used was not open, however, and when Oracle acquired Sun (and therefore Java), in 2010, the company saw an opportunity. By that time, Android had gotten bigger, and Oracle felt that it was owed money.
As is usually the case with jury trials surrounding the intricacies of technology, getting people who aren’t computer scientists or IT professionals to understand the nitty-gritty is … complicated.
Motherboard’s recap of the trial features this particularly telling exchange between the judge, William Alsup, and former Sun CEO Jonathan Schwartz. It concerns the operating system GNU, whose name stands for “GNU’s Not Unix.”
Over the past six years, the companies have argued various angles in court, with judgments at various levels waffling over what parts of software can and cannot be copyrighted (patent infringement claims were raised and dismissed as well). Oracle, using Google’s $21 billion in Android profit as a benchmark, is seeking a significant $9 billion in damages.
(Alsup is not entirely wrong here.)
Among the analogies lawyers have used to try and explain what an API is are filing cabinets, as well as breakfast menus and power plugs. I don’t have a great analogy of my own, but in lay terms, an API (short for “Application Programming Interface”) allows coders to access systems and computational functions that they did not create themselves. For instance, the Facebook API is what allows entities that are not Facebook to interact with Facebook’s data. APIs are how otherwise-discrete systems are able to communicate with one another.
At the heart of the case is the seesaw (and industry-dependent) balance between proprietary and open software, each of which have their proponents. To stereotype: People who want to get rich off of technology favor proprietary software, and coders who want to use technology as a means of increasing opportunity for the disenfranchised favor open source.
Open-source proponents point to the inability to copyright software as key to the technology industry’s rapid growth: Because companies can’t rest on their laurels and draw rents from proprietary software, the argument goes, they’re forced to innovate, and the industry drives forward. That somewhat progressive idea clashes with the, well, laws of the United States, which generally favor compensating corporations for the use of their work.
In an amicus brief filed in 2013, a number of high-profile computer scientists, argued that open software was key to a thriving tech industry, beginning with the ability to clone IBM’s BIOS software for competing computer-makers like Compaq and Gateway.
Should Google lose (a ways off, and both sides have indicated they plan to appeal), a leading principle of the software industry — that it is permissible, and even encouraged, to build off of the work of others — is at risk. Furthermore, it could have a chilling effect on developers and coders hoping to use other systems, given fears of costly licensing or litigation. And, thus, they might begin to construct fully closed systems, unable to communicate with or transfer data to systems outside of their own. That’s no good for the industry, and it’s even worse for consumers.
For years, rumors have persisted about a Chinese propaganda army known as the 50 Cent Party, which argues with government dissenters on social media and in comment sections online. The legend of the group — so-called because its members supposedly receive 50 cents in yuan (or eight American cents) for every post — has come to reflect the belief that China’s propaganda arm is ever-present online, keeping a watchful eye on its citizens and keeping them in line, online.
According to leaked emails from the country’s Internet Propaganda Office, pro-government social-media posts are made by government employees who otherwise have bigger jobs to do — the same way you might be asked to tweet about your employers’ latest project or product. It’s an extra task performed piecemeal, likely without extra compensation, rather than by a dedicated team. In other words, in this arena at least, Denny’s has a more institutionalized social-media strategy than the Chinese government.
But perhaps more important than who is posting is when they do it and how. The social-media propaganda game isn’t a steady torrent of pro-government messaging intended to change hearts and minds, but rather an attempt to distract critics “in highly focused bursts, at times of controversy or planned collective action.” Roughly one of every 178 posts on Chinese social media is made by a government employee for propaganda purposes, but those posts aren’t published at a regular pace. They’re timed to overwhelm dissent at key moments.
In other words, the Chinese government appears to have figured out that you can’t actually win an argument online — you can only distract your opponents and drown them out.
A new study, summarized by NPR, finds that many of the assumptions made about the 50 Cent Party are unfounded, and there’s little evidence to suggest that a dedicated team of online commenters actually exists. Instead, researchers at Harvard found that “almost no systematic empirical evidence exists for this claim, or, more importantly, for the Chinese regime’s strategic objective in pursuing this activity.”
Everyone and their mother is using Venmo. (Except my own mother, who calls it “Nemo” and refuses to download the app.) Since it launched back in 2012, the app has become so synonymous with “cashless transactions” that its name has become a verb — one sure sign of an app or site’s success. Another sure sign of an app’s success? Think pieces blaming it for a particular bad manner or social ill — like Kari Paul’s recent Quartz essay about the way Venmo is turning people into “petty jerks.”
Sure, sending a Venmo request to cover the cost of a few IPAs at happy hour feels less friendly, less personal than waiting for someone to make good on their offer to “get you next time.” Frankly, asking for money via emoji on an app is less personal. But money isn’t personal. Money is business. And there’s nothing impersonal, or petty, about asking to be paid back promptly. Especially if you’re anything like me or my friends, with whom the offer to “get the next one” is often unintentionally forgotten by the time the tab for the “next one” rolls around.
It might seem like a petty collection of minor debts and repayments — an endlessly scrolling portrait of a miser. But I think it’s actually what makes Venmo so great: It takes the hassle out of paying your friends, both in large and small increments. And, even better, it takes out the awkwardness of having to ask to be paid in return. The app becomes your middleman; no more saying “Hey, about the bar tab last night?” or “Wow, I bought SO many paper towels at Duane Reade on Tuesday” and hoping your friends pony up.
And Venmo isn’t just for good for bar tabs and splitting your Con Ed bills. “It’s nice at work, because in a situation where it would be weird to ask someone more senior than you for the money they owe you for ordering lunch, they can just Venmo you,” a 23-year-old New Yorker who works in the nonprofit sector explained. “Salads start to add up, but you also don’t want to be that person making a big deal out of lunch.” While it would be uncomfortable to ask for cash, sending a Venmo request for the equivalent dollar amount is totally kosher.
It’s easy, and often justified, to lament that there is too much automation in daily life. Many of the most popular apps and start-ups of the most recent tech boom are essentially replacements for certain human interactions. Way back in the glory days of cash, taking a cab (or so I’ve been told) involved a far more nuanced series of social considerations than it often does today: You had to call a dispatcher, give directions, calculate and ask for change, less tip. Uber has put each of those potentially awkward conversations behind a handful of buttons and taps on your phone. The same goes for ordering lunch, making dinner reservations, buying movie tickets. A romantic extrovert might find the ebbing away of these dozens of small daily personal exchanges sad, but a socially anxious introvert will find it enormously freeing.
Look: We’re socially conditioned to feel weird when it comes to money. You’re not really supposed to need to borrow it. And even if you do ask a friend to spot you (whether for $5 or $500), it’s supposed to be a chummy exercise in trust — one that often ends badly for the lender. (You ask to borrow $20, your friend obliges and then never brings it up again so as not to make things strange between you two.) Venmo, with its automated requests (“Taylor Swift requests $8.50 for sick beats”) keeps things fair without forcing you to craft a text message or have an IRL conversation that would accomplish the same thing but could leave both parties feeling sufficiently awkward.
One of my most recent Venmo transactions is a request for $3.33 from one of my roommates. It’s exactly one-third the price of one of those plastic pieces you shove into a shower drain to stop stray hair from clogging it and making your building superintendant very angry. If you scroll farther back in my Venmo history, you’ll see plenty more small costs. Four dollars from a friend who borrowed a few bucks to cover a cash tip at a nail salon, $2 for half of a movie on demand rental (Sisters — I hated it). Five-dollar requests paired with endless strings of beer and wine-glass emoji. The list goes on.
For me, Venmo falls firmly on the “freeing” side. That doesn’t mean it gives me permission to be rude; I still participate in what my friend Megan calls “Venmo etiquette.” “You should just always say ‘I’m going to Venmo you’ or ‘You can venmo me,’” she said. “Everyone I know who uses Venmo always asks or tells me in advance they’re going to charge me for something. To be frank, whenever someone does that to me, I’m glad — it makes me remember how much I need to pay them.” (Note that a Venmo request does not immediately deduct money from your bank account. You still have to accept a request to complete the transaction, so ultimately the decision to pay is always yours.)
It’s not to say that there aren’t petty jerks using Venmo. There are. (Quartz writer Kari Paul details an anecdote about a young woman being Venmo-ed $6 after drinking a glass of wine at a friend’s apartment. A glass of wine that the friend had willingly offered and poured for her guest. That’s petty. Don’t be that guy.) But asking your friends and colleagues to pay you back doesn’t make you one of them, it’s just par for the money-spending course.
Plus, if somebody is knocking down your door over a $6 drink you didn’t ask for in the first place, chances are good an app didn’t make them a petty jerk. They were probably just a jerk to begin with.
But it was unclear: What was Malek doing? Had the parking meter finally forced him to reckon with his own cog-like status in the great crushing machinery of capital? Malek has not spoken about these paparazzi shots before now, but this past weekend, speaking with a Select All reporter at the Peabody Awards, he broke his legendary silence:
Thank you, Rami. Keep fighting the good fight.
A few months ago, Rami Malek — first-tier Tumblr boyfriend and star of the USA network show Mr. Robot, in which he plays a paranoid hacker combatting a multinational corporate conspiracy — seemed to go full Method in a series of paparazzi photos in which he stood next to a parking meter and looked around suspiciously.
The photos went semi-viral among Malek’s fans, in part because they’re funny and in part because, well, if you toss a Rami Malek photo toward Twitter or Tumblr, it will flower into a full blossom of meme-ry:
You know what they say: “Hell hath no fury like a scorned Game of Thrones–loving woman.” According to a now-deleted post, a 29-year-old Redditor, after cheating on, and subsequently breaking up with, his girlfriend (“we’ll call her Dany”), finds that his now-ex has decided to wage war every week by ruining something they used to enjoy together: Game of Thrones.
“I think I expected a bit of advice? I read /r/relationships a lot and I expected a bit of flack because of the cheating but it’s been pretty much all flack,” the Redditor told me of the immediate and unfriendly responses he received. (Flack? For cheating? I’m stunned.) “I’ve no idea why it was shut down. A lot of people were giving me shit but there was also a lot of GOT spoilers. Maybe that’s why.”
He says Dany has blocked him on all social media, but briefly unblocks him every Monday to spoil major plot points. And to make sure he sees them, the Redditor says she keeps changing up her platform of choice. Dany’s used WhatsApp, Facebook, and has even borrowed a mutual friend’s cell phone to send text messages. (We’re a little confused as to why this guy keeps falling for the same shtick, but, then again, he did turn to Reddit for relationship advice.)
“She spoiled everything that happened basically. The Hodor one this week was probably the most annoying,” he said. (Though lets just go on the record saying that finding out your boyfriend cheated on you with several other women is likely more “annoying” than a ruined episode of television. But, hey, what do I know?) “I assumed Jon would come back but she spoiled when, so that pissed me off, too. And Stannis being confirmed as dead, because I thought he was alive.”
Wenner Media, the publishing company that owns Rolling Stone and Us Weekly, among other magazines, announced this morning that it would soon launch Glixel, a site dedicated to covering video games and the people who play them. It makes sense from an editorial perspective — games are increasingly sophisticated and the industry increasingly important; there’s a lot of opportunity for smart criticism and reporting — and from a business perspective: The gaming industry is enormous and only growing; its audience is young and primed to consume.
Since the first gaming magazines in the 1980s, video-game media has been governed by the same rules as any other enthusiast press: It’s generally driven by the big companies whose products are its main focus; news is made via press release (and the occasional leak); developers rarely speak to the media without PR handlers; and receiving games before they hit store shelves is generally predicated on playing ball with the companies who make them.
But for what seems to be such fertile ground for publishing companies, there aren’t many examples of wildly successful outlets for gaming journalism and criticism. That’s in part because video games are relatively new, of course — but it’s also because video games, with their young and connected audience, are at the vanguard of a mass culture that’s increasingly uninterested in institutional third-party publishing. And anyone who wants to make a gaming site is going to need to reckon with that.
This isn’t new, and it’s different from its enthusiast-press cousins in tech and entertainment only in degree, not in kind. What changed with the advent of the web was the sudden realization that there was an enormous audience for just about any kind of information about video games, no matter how small-bore or how stage-managed. Just as many entertainment and gadget blogs found success in the late 2000s and early 2010s pumping out a steady stream of publicist-controlled updates and information — small nuggets that wouldn’t have made a daily paper — so too were websites like Joystiq, Kotaku, and Destructoid (to name three large gaming blogs) able to build success off of an audience that wanted every single morsel of info that companies would put out.
But eventually, gaming companies realized that they could step around the press and go directly to the consumer. Why rely on outlets that proclaimed even a small amount of independence when you can control the entire presentation? So studios and hardware companies started to publish announcements directly to Facebook (rather than on the pages of friendly outlets) or to unveil trailers on YouTube. The annual Electronic Entertainment Expo, when companies make their biggest gaming announcements, has seen an upheaval in the last half-decade as publishers and developers realized they no longer needed to use the press to reach prospective buyers.
Nintendo, for example, no longer produces an elaborate stage show for its announcements — it simply puts out a video stream, known as Nintendo Direct, every few months. Likewise, heavyweight publishers like Electronic Arts (the Madden franchise) and Activision (Call of Duty) have pulled out of the event. Gaming companies have steadily realized that, quite honestly, they don’t need the press. Websites that gained an audience as game-company conduits are experiencing an identity crisis. E3, which is officially an industry trade show, has even recognized the need to go directly to the consumer, and is organizing its own event for the general public.
So the question becomes: What should a gaming site even be, if its potential audience is already predisposed to hate it, and its former subjects no longer need it? Some sites have decided to broaden their appeal. Polygon, which launched with dreams of producing ornate longform journalism about developers and their products, has since moved away from lengthy reporting and broadened its scope, adding film and television coverage.
If this story seems broadly familiar, it’s because it’s happening in the early stages all over the media industry: former subjects of coverage have found that they can access their target audiences directly, via social media. New platforms have allowed consumers earlier, and cheaper, access to the products that were once the subject of much-needed buying guides. Journalists are facing a crisis of access — it’s just that it happened in gaming earlier, and more quickly, than anywhere else.
Gaming journalism’s own crisis is made even worse by its audience. The gaming media, even before the flowering of anti-press Gamergate crusade, has always had a combative relationship with its readership. To some extent, it’s an intra-subcultural clash: The enormous audience for gaming news has traditionally been younger, and sought simpler pleasures (read: hornier), than the people producing that news. Good journalists and critics, who once felt free to take oppositional stances, are cowed by an audience that’s defensive of its favorite games and often bizarrely sympathetic to big studios. And hardcore gamers (or at least, their most vocal contingent) have generally struggled to accept that their once-outsider status is now mainstream, and that the medium is subject to — and often deserving of — criticism. That’s the fanboy mindset: publications can be simultaneously derided for regurgitating press releases, and for daring to be critical of a company’s product.
Perhaps the biggest upheaval has been in concert with the rising popularity of gaming livestream service Twitch. Gamers who want to know about a video game no longer have to read about it and imagine the experience; instead, they can watch someone do so at length and in real time. The Let’s Play format (and the steadily lowering technical barrier of its production) has caused some sites to retool substantially. Two years ago, Gamespot laid off a significant portion of its editorial staff in order to shift toward more video content, and Polygon underwent a similar retooling of its video department around the same period.
Kotaku is probably the best example of this change, having shifted to a format in which writers “embed” in certain games, following their developments and the online communities surrounding them for months at a time. Editor-in-chief Stephen Totilo wrote of the strategy shift:
In other words, Kotaku is reporting equally on the culture of gaming as it is on the games themselves. (And, frankly, the site’s coverage is noticeably more interesting following the move.)
It certainly helps that Glixel has the support of Wenner, a major media company that clearly wants to cash in on an industry expected to bring in $17 billion this year, and the name recognition of Rolling Stone (Glixel’s copy gives off the impression that it’s some sort of Rolling Stone subsidiary, rather than an independent brand). There’s still room for a luxury enthusiast outlet, for one thing; just because Sony and Microsoft can publish directly to their Facebook pages doesn’t mean they don’t also like the distance and prestige a good stage-managed feature can provide.
This is the problem that Glixel faces. If news on the gaming industry itself is no longer a draw, then a focus on how people play them deserves greater prominence. Indeed, Glixel’s editors, John Davison, Simon Cox, and Miguel Lopez, state as much: “Meanwhile, the celebrities of gaming are no longer just the visionaries behind the most popular games, but entire cultures that include pro gamers, modders, cosplayers, bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers, streamers, artists, and musicians.”
But the truth is that gaming journalism might actually end up better for the changes that have been undermining it. At the heart of the Glixel announcement is the fundamental push and pull between gamers, generally ahead of the curve on technological changes, and the media, which lags behind. Video on Twitch and press releases on Facebook have made those functions redundant for media outlets, and the sites that cover gaming are generally better now that they don’t have to worry about that stuff, ripped out of a PR cycle that made them complacent and reliant. It might be harder to make money off of writing about games, but it’ll also be harder to write bad coverage.
Before the thread was removed, plenty of other Redditors weighed in, but they weren’t offering the technical advice the OP was hoping for. Instead, plenty of GOT jokes and insults were bandied about. (Warning: Spoilers ahead.)
As for proving this whole thing isn’t the work of an elaborate internet troll, the Redditor says it all “really happened,” but that he has no interest in trying to prove it. “I don’t care if people think it’s a joke. At this point I kind of hope people do think it’s a joke so they’ll stop messaging me,” he said.
Last Tuesday, Brent Weinbach and Doug Lussenhop posted up at 1236 South Orange Drive in Los Angeles and waited for a car to get a parking ticket.
The Nissan Leaf, which was parked illegally on the right side of the street, eventually got a ticket after roughly half an hour of waiting around. As someone who recently received a parking ticket from the City of New York, this is relatable as hell. This is what hot social viral content is all about — I saw them get the parking ticket and I was like, “Damn … coulda been me getting that ticket. If I lived in L.A.”
There is, I think, an inclination to turn Facebook Live into another TV channel, but some, like Super Deluxe, which broadcast the parking-ticket video, are finding ways to use the format in the same way that we use the internet. Watching the ticket livestream isn’t like tuning in to a show, it’s like surfing the web, waiting for something to happen, waiting for something funny to pop up in your feed.
“People are on the internet anyway,” Lussenhop told LAist. He’s right! We’re on the internet doing stupid mundane things and there’s nothing you can do.
Senior pranks are a time-honored high school tradition that usually start out with the best-laid plans and end up somewhere south of a giant penis joke. These days, if you want to go viral (any good teen’s goal), you gotta up your game. So this year, the class of 2016 at Monarch High School in Florida decided they wanted to do something more memorable (and way more viral): Turn the parking lot into a giant dog park.
After a dog followed one of her classmates to school earlier this semester, Monarch senior Anna Douglas told me that her class decided to use that as their inspiration. All in, Douglas estimates around 70 students (out of about 500) brought their dogs to school on the last day of class.
“Our principal showed up and tried to put a stop to all of the commotion, (while he was taking pictures),” she said. “However, more students and their dogs showed up and he couldn’t control everyone. There were dogs in purses, dogs in strollers.” Douglas shared photos of the event on Twitter, which have since been retweeted by nearly 2,000 people and liked by several thousand more.
“We came to an agreement with our principal, that we could stay until the middle of first period. So my boyfriend drove his car over to where everyone was and played music,” Douglas explained. “Our principal was trying to be mad, but then begged us to play ‘Who Let the Dogs Out.’”
As far as actual mischief goes, the pooch stunt is about as tame as an episode of The Brady Bunch. But, hey, it’s better than the 700-ish other unoriginal, soon-to-be grads who, as you read this, are no doubt purchasing three chickens (or pigs, or goats, or what-have-you) with plans of labeling them one, two, and four, and setting them loose in the halls.
Twitter has announced a series of changes to how it treats tweets: Some tweets that start with other users’ handles will now be seen by all followers! URLs that point to uploaded pictures, GIFs, videos, and polls, no longer count toward the character limit! You can now retweet yourself! For infrequent users, the changes might seem kind of minor — really, they make Twitter’s behavior a bit more intuitive — but for power users, who at this point are intimately familiar with exactly what they can get away with on the service, there’s still some confusion about how, exactly, the new rules will affect the Twitter experience. (Especially because Twitter is a service geared very specifically toward the outspoken and impatient.) Let’s try to simplify it. Here, as precisely as possible, is what the new Twitter rules mean.
Pictures uploaded to Twitter don’t count toward the character limit.
Neither do videos, GIFS, or polls. This means you can fit more words in your presumably fire tweets. (URLs pointing to pictures hosted on other sites or services, like Imgur, will still count.)
Oh, right: You can retweet yourself.
Handles also don’t count, as long as they start tweets.
Beginning a tweet with @InsertNameHere will no longer deduct numbers from your character count. Placing it inside the tweet will, however. Again, more room for fire.
You can now bring back older tweets without having to reply to your old tweets with “Bump” and hope for a few more favs.
Most importantly: New tweets that start with another user’s handle will now appear in your follower’s feeds, even if your followers don’t follow the other user.
But @ replies are still hidden.
Unless you retweet yourself.
Neither do quoted tweets.
Add new commentary to an old tweet. Quote-tweeting gives you another 140 characters, so you can use this option to basically double the length of your tweets.
Daniel, whose job on the show is described as “Canadian,” greeted JoJo, the bachelorette, with a turn of phrase so cringeworthy that it shaved a decade off of my life. He said, “Damn, JoJo. Back at it again as the next bachelorette.”
I know what this is, you know what this is. JoJo did not know what this is, which is fine! Internet memes are by and large nonsense that have no substantial impact on the other parts of our lives.
It’s a reference to the supremely popular “Damn, Daniel” meme, in which Daniel wore white Vans sneakers repeatedly and his friend Josh noticed.
But Daniel was determined to seduce a woman using memes, which I can personally assure you is a terrible idea. Later in the episode, he tried to explain “Damn, Daniel” and it was an excruciating and devastating television moment, like when Joe Theismann’s leg snapped.
“— because, have you seen that video ‘Damn, Daniel, back at it again with the white Vans’?
Absolutely.
“I was like, ‘Daaaaamn, JoJo.’ Have you seen that viral video?”
My DUDE, give it a rest. Asking someone if they’ve seen a viral video multiple times is a big no-no. Trying to explain memes is a fool’s errand for a couple of reasons. First: Reciting memes using the awful flesh portal we call a mouth is a bad move. Even catchphrases like “Damn, Daniel” sound like gibberish. Memes just don’t work in the meatspace.
Secondly, unlike conventional forms of comedy, memes are mostly nonsense. They are often arbitrary, and go viral because it’s funny when arbitrary nonsense goes viral. To explain why memes are funny is an exercise in futility, the answer might not even exist.
This is the number-one sin committed by people who spend all day online and on social media: assuming that everyone else does, too. It is an incredibly condescending stance to take! People have jobs and lives and outside interests, or maybe they just don’t care! Why on earth would you expect someone to know about the viral video of a kid’s shoes? It’s nonsense — I love it, but it is grade-A USDA nonsense. More so, why would you expect knowledge of web trends from a reality-TV star who is probably not allowed anywhere near a Wi-Fi connection?
“Anyways, have you not even followed the internet the last couple of months?”
You’ll need to retweet your own reply tweet if you want all of your followers to see it. As discussed, the change only applies to tweets that start a thread, so your negging will remain (somewhat) obscured unless you want to share it.
If I reply to a tweet of Donald Trump’s — rather than begin a new thread — and you follow me but don’t follow him, you won’t see it.
A video of what appears to be a driver asleep at the wheel of a Tesla running on autopilot is making the rounds on Reddit today. Teslas are engineered to steer themselves and avoid crashing into other people on the road, but their creator, Elon Musk, has repeatedly warned that the vehicles aren’t meant to transport unconscious riders. At least not yet.
Do us all a favor and listen to Elon.
It’s the one sentence no expectant parent wants to hear: “Your Twitter parody account has been hacked by the notorious terror organization known as ISIS.”
When I created KWF, my only intent was to make people laugh. I quickly discovered that the best way to do this was to tweet the same classic joke over and over again.
I suppose that, in a way, though, I am a parent. My child? The parody parody Twitter account @KattWillFerrell. And terrifying prenatal exam results? The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.
Now, you might say: That joke is not only old, it’s not funny. But there’s no arguing with success. Twitter loves its parody accounts, which amass retweets and favs in the thousands and followers in the millions. So the question posed by @KattWillFerrell is: What if you make an account that tries to draft off the success of both Katt Williams and Will Ferrell? What you get is a Twitter humor algorithm combining the charismatic personalities of two different comedians, pulling in all the hottest memes, jokes, and topical tweets, and mixing them together into a delicious, coherent, highly viral laughter stew.
In order to understand @KattWillFerrell, you need to understand how Twitter works. Twitter is filled with accounts mimicking popular comedians like Will Ferrell and Katt Williams, which trade on name-recognition to gain followers. Accounts like “@kattwilliams___” and “@itsWillyFerrell” pump out a steady stream of stale and stolen jokes that tend to sound more like boardwalk T-shirts than like the comedians they’re supposedly parodying. (The word parody is generally used in these accounts’ bios in order to escape Twitter’s policy against impersonations, not to signal their approach to comedy.)
For the record, I’m not an expectant parent. But I did hear that sentence, or one very close to it, and it really stressed me out, so if I were an expectant parent, I imagine I would have been even more stressed out, what with the pregnancy and the hormones and everything.
The account was suddenly entirely different — filled with low-resolution, unsourced photographs; vague references to events and ideas that the average person wouldn’t understand; a mishmash of unrelated hashtags like #FakeMarriageFacts and #MyDepressionLooksLike. ISIS had taken my combination Katt Williams/Will Ferrell parody Twitter account and turned it into a soulless vehicle for cynical audience gathering.
Luckily, we had an ace up our sleeves. That ace? Online security expert Michael “@Dogboner” Hale. The sleeve? The — I guess … the sleeve would be just, like, the list of KWF employees. It’s not important. Dogboner got down to business. It was like something out of a Tom Clancy techno-thriller. We pulled the rug right out from under these ISIS fools, simply by having Twitter send the changed password to the email address which we had used to set up @KattWillFerrell in the first place.
But the truth is, @KattWillFerrell might have more in common with ISIS than I thought. We’re both horizontally organized. We both have aggressive, forward-thinking visual branding. We both share a love of disruption. Most important: We both understand the power of memes and hashtags to reach a wide audience of influencers and potential customers. ISIS and @KattWillFerrell may stand for different things, but we can agree on one thing: Ten years ago we had Bob Hope, Johnny Cash, and Steve Jobs. Please don’t let Kevin Bacon die.
This be the verse we grave for thee:Here lies where .@ ought to be;Home is the sailor from the thirsty sea,And the attention-hunter home from the hill.
But, at least as far as many Twitter users were concerned, the X-Men extravaganza was a flop. Snapchat’s filters have never been constant and change regularly, but the public reaction to the takeover wasn’t positive. Many people were celebrating Tuesday’s return to normalcy on the app. (“Normalcy” being animated rainbow puke.) Some even went so far as to imply that they’d stopped using the app on Monday in a temporary boycott to get Snapchat to bring back their beloved filters.
According to a tweet from Mac, the Forbes reporters worked on the story for more than a month — but one imagines that Denton giving an interview to the Times on the subject was a powerful motivator to finish and publish the scoop. And now, on the day Gawker is back in court, Thiel’s involvement has gone from inside rumor to reported news.
That’s valuable, even if it does lead to a Twitter outcry. I didn’t love Taco Bell’s anthropomorphized taco filter, but it was viewed a staggering 224 million times, making it the top campaign in Snapchat history. (“Taco Bell and Snapchat credit the campaign as a success because the taco-shaped head was subtly branded,” Adweek noted. I’m not sure “subtle” is the right term.) While we don’t know how much 20th Century Fox shelled out for Monday’s filters, the New York Times reports that sponsoring a lens can cost $450,000 to $750,000 per day. (And that’s just a single lens!)
The sympathizing effect of the news among journalists is already evident. For much of the Hogan trial, Gawker has been (at best) held at arm’s length by its peers — but the secretive involvement of a tech industry billionaire with deep pockets and a desire to see a media outlet destroyed is far more worrisome. As Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo wrote — though not without a to-be-sure-Gawker’s-published-stories-I-hate aside — “the impact of being able to destroy a publication you don’t like by combining the machinery of the courts with anonymity and unlimited funds to bleed a publication dry.” Glenn Greenwald, a critic past Gawker stories outing gay men, emphasized that it “shows how financial struggles can destroy free press: no $ for sustained reporting, fear of rich targets.”
This post has been updated with news of today’s Hogan trial proceedings.
But even if the revelation has made Denton a more sympathetic figure, the impact of the news on the actual trial, if any, has yet to be seen. Earlier today, Judge Pamela Campbell denied Gawker’s motion for a new trial, as well as its motion to reduce the $140 million in damages. This was to be expected; Hogan’s hometown courtroom was never even remotely sympathetic to Gawker’s defense. The question now is the extent to which the Thiel story will affect Gawker’s chances in the appellate court, which are historically much more sympathetic to free speech proponents than standard juries. It’s much harder to present Hogan as a simple man bullied by New York’s media elite when you’ve got the financial backing of one of the most powerful men in Silicon Valley.
A video of Senatore performing his weird talent at the senior class talent show at Ardrey Kell High School in North Carolina has taken over Twitter today. Initially shared by his friend Wesley Manning (the Josh Holz to Senatore’s “Damn” Daniel Lara), the video has been retweeted over 39,000 times. The whole thing only lasts 30 seconds, starting with Senatore’s dramatic entrance, but if the purpose of cinema is to move the soul, it is a masterpiece.
Mike Senatore is a simple teen. A self-described average guy who plays no sports, works at a car wash, and “doesn’t really do anything special.” That’s not quite true, though. He does one special thing. He flips water bottles. And, thanks to a wildly enthusiastic high-school talent-show audience, and the internet, he’s now a legend: The Water Bottle-Flipping Guy.
(Please watch this with the sound on. Your life will be richer for it.)
As for those looking to re-create Senatore’s feat, he gave us a few tips. “You’ve got to fill the bottle about one-third with water and it’s all about just practicing a lot and getting the flick of the wrist,” he said. “And my preferred brand of bottle is Deer Park because the shape of the bottle is best for flipping. “
From there, the bottle-flipping trend grew in popularity with his classmates, though Senatore says he was still its chief practitioner: “I just got the most bored in school out of everybody.” When senior year rolled around, he knew he wanted to perform a bottle flip for the class, but says he didn’t put anymore thought into his now-viral act until the night before.
“I’m still just trying to process it all,” Senatore said. “The minute I walked offstage and was no longer visible to anybody in the audience, I threw my fist in the air. I high-fived the first person I saw. I knew I’d nailed it, but when I watched the video after I was like ‘I didn’t realize it looked that good!’”
If you haven’t seen it yet, you should watch the video of high-school senior Mike Senatore flipping a water bottle onstage so that it lands perfectly upright. At the risk of spoiling what makes the video so wonderful: The crowd goes wild. It’s great, and if you love it as much as the internet did, you will be pleased to learn there are more videos in the same genre.
For instance, look at this break-dance video. It’s pretty good!
There is, of course, the kid who nails this Chinese yo-yo trick. It’s beautiful. As the world around his loses its damn mind, he stays cool and collected.
What could be better than a scene of an enormous high-school crowd — the kind usually only ever assembled for a fight — losing their minds over a Chinese yo-yo trick? It’s a knowing kind of enthusiasm, but no less wonderful. And finally, there’s this beauty. You might think that you know who is going to win the dance battle. Think again.
There are some pros to this rolling death trap. For one thing, it is — according to the people who invented it and are trying to sell it — much cheaper to construct and operate than a subway. Sure. Secondly, this thing is going to scare the bejesus out of drivers.
1) That’s not a bus at all. That’s just a weird-looking train. It’s on rails. That’s, like, the definition of a train. It’s a funky train, for sure, but it’s definitely a train. I’m 100% on this. Train. Not bus.
Best of luck to the people making this ridiculous bus-train, which will never actually exist.
2) This thing looks great as a toy model and in practice seems like a deathtrap that will revolutionize not only transportation but also the way in which your life is ended prematurely.
That being said, a few things:
From CityLab:
Still, this was good: A positive but not glowing review from Rolling Stone is hardly a tragedy. And yet 2,700 Ariana Grande fans have signed a petition demanding that the review-aggregation site Metacritic remove the Rolling Stone review from its average. “[T]he review itself remains extremely unprofessional and in no way backs up its low score,” the petition’s author, one Elliot Karsten, of Alexandria, Virginia, writes
Welcome to the hellworld of Metacritic. The popular entertainment site — which collects reviews for TV shows, movies, music, and video games, converts them to “scores” out of 100, and then calculates a “metascore” — is the unfortunate product of an internet filled with overwhelmed consumers, overworked critics, and overdefensive fans. And it has real power over certain industries.
The Grande petition is ridiculous, but it points to the extent to which sites like Metacritic have warped the internet’s ability to process popular culture. To a certain degree, a single score can be a kind of useful consumer guide, but as certain kinds of culture — music and television, in particular — become easier to obtain without enormous up-front payments, the score becomes less useful as a service. Instead, it stands as a mark of a given object’s quality. Every few years, a film critic ends up on the receiving end of a torrent of complaints — not for leveling a poor critical argument but for ruining a film’s until-then perfect aggregate score on Rotten Tomatoes, as Armond White did in 2010 for Toy Story 3, and Matt Pais did in 2014 for Boyhood.
Last week, Ariana Grande’s third album, Dangerous Woman, was released to reviews that most people would describe as “generally favorable.” Many critics liked it. Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B-plus; AllMusic gave it four stars out of five. Rolling Stone noted that “Grande may not have settled on a sound, but she’s still an outsized, dangerous talent,” and only gave her three stars out of five.
The Metacritic system — which transmutes every review, regardless of its scale, into a score out of 100 — is inherently flawed. Entertainment Weekly’s aforementioned B-plus score becomes an 83, while Rolling Stone’s three out of five more clearly becomes a score of 60. But if we were to translate Rolling Stone’s score into a letter grade, it would be a D-minus, far harsher than its text would indicate. Do you see how this can get messy and distort things? (Metacritic’s system has only been unimpeachably correct in one instance: when it named Spoon the best band of the 2000s.) The film site Rotten Tomatoes is even more aggressive, separating every review into the category of “good” or “bad.”
Much has been written about how the internet is changing cultural criticism. What was once a one-way conversation from a handful of authoritative voices has spread into an entire, well, web. Cultural consumption online is now largely defined around “fandom” — your participation in a quasi-religious movement centered on the characters or authors of a given work of music or fiction. And part of being involved in an online fandom, whether it’s for video games, pop stars, or comic-book movies, is to be confrontational when things don’t go your way. Sometimes this can be minor, like when a single review causes an average score to dip, and sometimes it can explode, like when the critical rejection of Batman v Superman caused a flare-up in the eternal struggle between die-hard fans and outsider critics. The always-revisable nature of the web gives the impression that fan protests can actually change a judgment. At the very least, they can exert pressure on future critical opinions.
If this all seems silly, it is and it isn’t. Metacritic scores don’t matter to pop stars like Ariana Grande. She will continue to be popular, and she will continue to get paid handsomely. But in the video-game industry, metascores hold a crazy amount of power. As Kotaku reported back in 2013, Obsidian, the developer of Fallout: New Vegas, had contractual terms that stated that if the game received a Metacritic average of 85, the team would receive a $1 million bonus. They fell just short (84 on PC and Xbox, 82 on PlayStation), missing out on a payout that would have amounted to more than $14,000 per team member. Aggregate scores are now useful cudgels in business negotiations too, with publishers extracting more favorable terms out of developers.
But for stans and fanboys alike, the aggregate score has become a useful line of attack because, in a certain sense, they’re right: One bad apple can spoil the bunch. From a marketing standpoint, it’s more compelling to say, “Everyone agrees,” than it is to say, “These three guys had nice words.” Cultural criticism no longer exists in a vacuum; every instance of it feeds into a larger whole. It’s turned pop culture into a quantity and transformed fandom into a game of sabermetrics. This is how being a fan works now. Get used to it.
This is not to say that aggregate scoring is entirely useless. Last summer, social media and Rotten Tomatoes were arguably more useful tools for predicting a film’s success than previous tracking methods.
As with the thermostat, smart lighting started out blissfully — “look at all the great colors I can do with my light bulbs!” — and eventually fell into the absurd. When the first firmware update rolled around, it was exciting, until I spent an hour trying to update lightbulbs. Nobody warned me that being an adult would mean wasting my waking hours updating Linux on a set of lightbulbs, rebooting them until they’d take the latest firmware. The future is great.
When I first got a Canary, the system was a one-off purchase for the hardware and came with a free online service for saving videos of incidents in your home. Handy, but not exactly a sustainable business model — I didn’t really think anything of it, though, until late 2015, when a firmware update touted that I’d need to pay a monthly fee to keep those videos.
Before you buy that “smart” gadget this year, consider who’s behind it, if the business is sustainable and if it has a fallback for when things go wrong. In many cases, the companies behind these slickly marketed gadgets have no answer for any of those concerns.
The Internet of Shit is a pseudonymous Twitter account that started as a jab at the Internet of Things, but later became one of the strongest critics of the ‘smart’ devices creeping into our homes. Now, IoS works to expose the poorly designed devices rapidly coming into our homes.
In that sense, Thiel’s plan for revenge relied not just on tenacity and wealth but on luck. As Ken Paulson, president of Vanderbilt’s First Amendment Center, points out, the other lawsuits that he’s believed to be funding against the company are extremely unlikely to ever result in enormous adverse judgments: “If the suit is frivolous, and intended to inflict thousands of paper cuts, responsible judges will throw that out right away.” (We can note here that the judge in the Hogan trial, Pamela Campbell, probably shouldn’t be considered a “responsible” judge.) And Thiel seems to have only opened up two “paper cuts” — lawsuits by freelance writer Ashley Terrill and scientist Shiva Ayyadurai — anyway.
Does Thiel’s strategy to bankrupt Gawker open the floodgates? Consider that the Thiel-Hogan-Gawker nexus is so specifically odd — a confluence of personal and professional grudges, high-profile egoists, and lopsided legal proceedings — that it’s hard to imagine it could really set a particular pattern of attack. To start with, few publications are as eager as Gawker to push the boundaries of first-amendment law; maybe more important, the Hogan case is itself a kind of black swan — a lawsuit that, were it not for the venue, the judge, and the fact that it was argued in front of a jury, would likely never have made it as far, and which is expected to be overturned or greatly reduced on appeal.
“I realize there are gradations in some things. You can always eat up somebody’s resources, time, and budget by suing them — and particularly by suing them repeatedly,” Paulson says. But even so, “I don’t think there’s anything that’s happened in this case that escalates the threat against a free press.” The circumstances of the Hogan case, which Thiel is funding for highly personal reasons, are largely unique. “That’s highly unusual and I don’t think it’s a game-changer for anybody,” Paulson said.
But maybe the bigger reason Thiel’s scheme doesn’t open any floodgates is that those particular floodgates were never really closed. Media companies operate in a hostile climate; presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has explicitly advocated making it easier to litigate against media companies. Thiel may have the Count of Monte Cristo flair for chilled revenge, but he isn’t even the first billionaire in the last year to put his wealth toward lawsuits intended to destroy a media organization. Mother Jones, the liberal nonprofit magazine, recently won a judgment against billionaire Republican donor Frank VanderSloot, but at a cost of $2.5 million to the publication and its insurance company (and two years of consequent financial and institutional stress). In the wake of VanderSloot’s loss, the Idaho billionaire established the Guardian of True Liberty Fund, in order to defend conservatives against the liberal media, and said he’d put up $1 million of his own money for anyone who wanted to sue Mother Jones or members of the liberal press. The only difference between VanderSloot and Thiel is that VanderSloot hasn’t tried to hide his bullying tactics.
As TechCrunch notes, the pair’s approach is a bit different:
It’s easy to forget, amid thousands of different wireless signals and networks, that there is a significant physical infrastructure that ties the internet together. Specifically, a surprisingly small group of undersea cables.
It’s an unusual move for Microsoft and Facebook, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that other companies are about to start laying their own independent cables.
Today, Microsoft and Facebook announced that they would begin laying another cable, running from Virginia to Spain, later this year. The cable, “featuring eight fiber pairs and an initial estimated design capacity of 160Tbps [terabytes per second],” is meant to boost both companies’ cloud capabilities. The cable will be known as MAREA.
Contemporary art has the power to change lives; to move people to tears; to make dads say, skeptically, “My 5-year-old kid could paint that.” Inspired by this multivalence, California teens TJ Khayatan and Kevin Nguyen (the guys are cousins, neighbors, and “sadly” friends) decided to create their own art installation during a recent trip to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art: They put Kevin’s glasses on the floor of the museum and watched as people stopped and stared at their creation.
Earlier today, Scripps Spelling Bee contestant Mitchell Robson was thrown a bit of a curve ball. One of 18 spellers remaining, Robson was asked to spell the word nagelfluh, which we all know is a noun defined as “a massive variegated conglomerate forming a prominent member of the Miocene series in the Alps.”
Mitchell prevailed, and his family was very happy. His brother, in particular, went dab-wild.
Whoa, dude. Don’t dab too fast. You might pull a muscle.
They also tried the stunt with a few other objects, like a baseball cap, but that didn’t seem to attract the same attention. (One might argue that this is evidence that the glasses were, in fact, art.) “When we put the glasses down at the exhibit you and others saw, a lot people actually stopped and examined them. Heck, some people even took pictures,” Kevin told me. “Most of the people held their chin up with their hand as if they were quite impressed with the work of ‘art,’” TJ added.
As for ending their impromptu exhibition, TJ and Kevin said another museum patron got wise to their hijinks and was going to report them. The glasses quickly transformed from an exhibition piece to a useful tool: “They were my glasses, so obviously I need them to see,” Kevin observed. “It was a bit awkward since many groups of people were constantly approaching the glasses, so we had to find the perfect moment to retrieve them,” TJ said. “We waited a good five minutes for the group to clear up. After we picked them up, I saw a couple on the side laughing to each other when they saw us.”
“Many people are saying that we created our own art while trying to mock it, which is kind of ironic because we never really intended on it being ‘art,’” he added. “We did it for a good laugh and never thought documenting people’s reaction would get us 50,000 retweets.”
But as Degas said, “Art is not what you see, but what you make others retweet.” Or something like that.
“We really did enjoy the art there, but we felt like anybody could make some of this ‘art’ we saw. We saw two bears on a blanket and we didn’t feel like it was modern art,” Kevin told me via group Twitter DM, the preferred method of communication for any good teen. “That piece kind of fell flat, so TJ and I thought, ‘What if we put down random things and how would people react?’”
Here’s an obvious statement: Apple makes excellent phones. Here’s an obvious, but somewhat less-often spoken statement: Apple also fills those phones up with crap.
Since the release of the App Store in the summer of 2008, Apple has ushered in a totally new era of software. Software suddenly had access to new data it had never had before, could do things it could never do before, could be constructed and distributed quickly and cheaply. It also got a cool new name: apps.
Sadly, for the company that started the boom, Apple, with a few exceptions, is pretty bad at making apps. This mattered a bit less in 2008, when apps were mostly games or utilities and needed to be only simple and effective. But now there are big, important categories of smartphone apps that are fantastically complicated; they are interconnected, cross-platform, cloud-based troves of information that need to talk to one another and constantly update and make sense.
From CNET: “Apple Music has a lot of potential, but its iCloud Music Library bugs and confusing interface keep it from edging out Spotify for now.”
From PCMag: “Most people are better served by either Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive, both Editors’ Choices for cloud storage and file-syncing services that include online productivity apps.”
Almost all of Apple’s apps of this sort — streaming music, cloud storage, contacts, calendars, documents, maps, web browsers, e-book readers, podcasts, email — are second-tier, at best. But don’t just take it from me!
From the Verge: “Apple’s desktop and mobile mail apps were once superb, but, despite some nice feature additions, I find they’ve become slow and unreliable.”
CNET again, on Apple’s redesigned podcast app: “All this amounts to a podcast manager that is – wait for it – serviceable!”
But the great thing about the App Store is that you don’t need to stick with Apple’s unfortunate defaults. There are many replacements for all of these apps, which are by now essential pieces of your smartphone. It is possible, and I would argue preferable, to take the operating system and hardware of the iPhone, and huck all the apps right in the garbage (or, well, in a “utilities” folder somewhere in a back page of your home screen).
Apple Maps has improved markedly since its infamous debut. Still: Get Google Maps or Waze. Personally, I find Waze’s interface and insistence on turning white-knuckled drives on the BQE into games with prizes infuriating, but people swear by its constantly updating directions.
Still, I’d stick with Google Maps, which is incorporating Waze’s technology and can give drive times and directions as accurately as Waze can, in a somewhat more attractive and less cute package. Even better, when tied into all the other Google stuff you’re probably using, Google Maps can remember your home and work, can update you on public transit, can remember your appointments and guide you there — and if you’ve recently searched for something on Google Maps on your computer? It’ll be right there on your phone.
Get Chrome. There’s a pretty good chance you already use it (according to NetMarketShare it’s the most popular browser out there), but, if you don’t, download it. If you’re already signed in to Chrome on your desktop, you’ll get all of your history, your auto-filled URLs, your bookmarks and login information, and all kinds of other stuff.
If you’re still an MP3 kind of person using iTunes, you’re going to have to stick with the Music app. But if you’re into streaming, stay far away from Apple. Spotify is beloved, has more users, your friends are probably on it, and it works with basically any device. But, having tried all the major services, I actually prefer Tidal for ease of use (not to mention exclusives).
If you want to back up your phone, you’re going to have to use iCloud. But for general storage, stick to Dropbox, which syncs much more reliably between desktop and phone; for editing text, use Google Docs, which is easier to access on both the phone and computer. Both are universally better-reviewed, and generally cheaper.
Oh my God, have you guys tried Google Photos? It’s, like, so good. It automatically backs up everything, for free, and has some pretty incredible search and organizing capabilities. You can search by location or year, or even by person — like, you can say “find me all pictures of my brother” and it’ll do it. It’s even free!
Apple controls the Podcast industry, but its app is … not great. You almost can’t go wrong: Basically anything will give you easier search functions and more options for streaming and downloading and subscribing. But both Lifehacker and the Verge recommend Overcast, which is good enough for me.
First, I highly recommend using two different apps for your work and personal email, if possible. It’s easier to prioritize during the week and on the weekends when you’re not worried that the red “4” badge might be your boss freaking out, and it helps separate out your life from your job at a time when so much of both is conducted on your phone.
Even your keyboard can be replaced. Google just recently released GBoard, a keyboard replacement for iOS that’s way better than Apple’s stock keyboard and also, annoyingly, better than the Google keyboard for Android. It predicts emoji when you start typing them, which is nice, but the best part is that it has a built-in search button. From right there in the keyboard, you can search the web, and find info and images and GIFs.
Is iMessage. Apple’s chat service isn’t perfect, but it’s ubiquitous and good enough for what it does, especially in its speed, simplicity, and ability to sync messages among different machines. Google’s Hangouts (formerly GChat), WhatsApp, and the others are perfectly fine and have the benefit of working on any device, but if you’re an iPhone talking to an iPhone, iMessage is the way to go.
Broadly speaking, if you’re already locked in to Gmail and Google Maps, your best bet is to just replace Apple’s defaults with Google’s equivalents: They’re generally better-designed, and, if you use the same services on desktop, much more useful. (The one caveat: If you have major privacy concerns, don’t use Google’s services. But if you have major privacy concerns, I’d suggest not carrying a smartphone around with you at all.) But if you want more specifics, read on.
There are few forms of online pedantry more annoying than a spelling correction. Spelling errors are not a huge deal, but they still feel very embarrassing. (Full disclosure: In sixth grade, I was runner-up in a spelling bee after I misspelled “embarass” [sic].)
But once in a blue moon there is a very good spelling correction. Take last night, for instance, when the Scripps National Spelling Bee ethered someone so hard that they had to delete their Twitter account.
Questioning why the bee has a comfort couch, where children go to cry after they lose, Kyle Chapman told the Bee’s account that they need to “quit teaching kids it’s okay to loose.”
The Bee struck back.
Simple but effective. Chapman’s Twitter account has since disappeared, though a cached version features a banner image that reads “proud to be an asshole.” We’ve reached out to him for comment and will update if we hear back.
For work mail: Outlook. If you’re used to using Outlook on the desktop, you probably hate it, but Microsoft’s app is a revelation — lightweight, easy to use, and filled with features the desktop app doesn’t have, like scheduling emails to deal with later.
For personal mail: Gmail. Most likely you’re already using it, and since Apple’s Mail app treats mail differently than Google does, trying to make them work together is eternally frustrating. Gmail’s app for iPhone is simple, clean, excellent; if you’re feeling advanced and like bright colors, you can try Google’s future-of-mail app, Inbox.
Whatever else you might think about Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who went on record this week as the secret financer behind Hulk Hogan’s devastating lawsuit against Gawker Media, he is a terrible literary critic. The Lord of the Rings is his favorite book, but he has apparently got no earthly idea what it is about. In a 2008 interview in the libertarian magazine Reason, he explained breezily that “Tolkien and The Lord of the Rings expressed the ideas that absolute power corrupts absolutely, that the ideal world is one in which people enjoy more freedom, and that that’s a world where you’ll have the greatest amount of human prosperity and happiness and ultimately achievement.”
The Lord of the Rings is the tale of the restitution of a just king to his rightful throne. It is absolutely a monarchist, militarist, authoritarian story, idealizing both the kings of Gondor and of Rohan to a romantic pitch understandable only in the context of the Second World War, during the course of which much of the book was written. I can’t think of a single way in which Tolkien expresses the idea of individual political freedom; the politics of Middle-earth are manifestly, uniformly about submitting to those more wise and just than ourselves. (This might resonate a bit this week.) Even Gandalf is subject to the dictates of his own Order. There is the overthrow of the tyrant, Sauron, sure, but we see no evidence that his subjects are better off or more “free” after he is destroyed; indeed, most of them are destroyed with him.
Thiel goes around naming all his companies and groups after the artifacts and personages in Tolkien — Valar, Mithril, Lembas, etc. — but Palantir, the name of his secretive data-analysis company, is in a class of its own. In Tolkein’s Middle-earth, the palantír (pl. palantíri) are like crystal balls that can show events far away and in different times. So far, so appropriate. But the palantír with which the book is principally concerned (the palantír of Anárion) is secretly controlled by the evil Sauron, and proves the eventual ruin of Denethor, Steward of Gondor. It’s a deadly trick, a deceitful ‘crystal ball’ that drives its possessor mad. Hmm, we might say, stroking our chins.
But Thiel is not quite Sauron, though both have a fondness for working in secret to topple their enemies. He’s not really even the Bond villain that his fondness for wild schemes like the anti-Gawker crusade and “seasteading” — the construction of man-made libertarian-paradise islands, to which Thiel has donated more than a million dollars — would have him seem. In truth, Thiel, a self-avowed Ayn Rand fan who thinks that women’s suffrage has undermined the greatness of capitalist democracy and that freedom and democracy are incompatible, is a rather more familiar figure: a man with a distaste for the messy realities of the political present, over-enamored with his own intellect, and unaware of his own blind spots. If you’ve spent enough time on Twitter, or in the great comments sections of the internet, you know this type depressingly well. In truth the only thing really scary about Peter Thiel is that he has enough money to buy his own serious reception.
He’s donated more than a million dollars to the Seastead Institute to research the feasibility of its aforementioned floating government-free zones, and pumped money into research into artificial intelligence and life-extension technology, a somewhat peculiar obsession for a self-described Christian. (“Probably the most extreme form of inequality is between people who are alive and people who are dead,” he told The New Yorker’s George Packer.)
And money he has! While he considers his campaign against Gawker “one of my greater philanthropic things that I’ve done,” it’s hardly the only “philanthropy” he participates in. Most well-known might be the Thiel Fellowship, a wheeze whereby the billionaire pays talented college students to drop out and work on their own projects instead. So far, there have been 80-odd graduates of this program, and they have come up with spray-on caffeine (also a cool solar-power device called SunSaluter designed by Eden Full, an engineer who went back to Princeton after her fellowship was completed).
Thiel was born in Germany but raised in California, a chess prodigy (ranking seventh among under-13s, at age 12; okay, that’s pretty good) and brilliant student (valedictorian of San Mateo High School, California, okay). At Stanford he co-founded a libertarian journal, The Stanford Review (thanks to funds from the Collegiate Network, an Olin Foundation–funded group that nurtured and funded conservative/libertarian student publications from whence arose a startling number of right-wing pundits), went on to law school, failed to secure a Supreme Court clerkship (to be fair: a failure most of us share!), and spent much of the 1990s trading derivatives and running a hedge fund.
Still, though: It’s legal for Peter Thiel to use his money to make use of the public courts to silence a publication that he doesn’t like. The hundreds of people who work for that publication can go to hell, so far as Thiel is concerned, and so can its millions of readers; Peter Thiel doesn’t like Gawker, and therefore Gawker must go. It’s for our own good, he told the New York Times.
His career as one of tech’s most revered investors began in 1998, when he founded PayPal with Max Levchin. Thiel seemed to initally see PayPal as the beginning stages of what was destined to become a bitcoin-like networked finance system — part tax shelter, part hedge against currency fluctuations, part mad high-libertarian scheme to free humanity. It failed to do any of those things, but it made Thiel enormously rich when it sold to eBay for $1.5 billion, in 2002. His post-PayPal hedge fund, Clarium Capital, was somewhat less successful — by 2011, the value of investments had fallen 65 percent from their peak in 2008 — but a $500,000 loan he made to Mark Zuckerberg has since turned into a 10 percent stake in Facebook, worth more than a billion dollars, and a seat on the company’s board.
This as much as anything is what makes “libertarianism” seem inadequate to describe Thiel’s politics. Thiel is a donor to the Committee to Protect Journalists; as a libertarian he should surely support a free press — one of the great barriers to an all-powerful state. And if you support a free press, you support Gawker, no matter if they tell prurient stories, and even if they are forced to issue corrections or retractions sometimes. Freedom of press particularly means freedom for press you don’t like.
But the true beneficiaries of Thiel’s “philanthropy” against Gawker, as J.K. Trotter noted there yesterday, are not the common people he sees himself as defending (common people like the professional wrestler Hulk Hogan), but his fellow Silicon Valley Disruption Brigade: the self-regarding entrepreneurs who do not care to have their feet put to the fire by any pesky fact-finding, fact-publishing, “bullying” journalists. For one who has persistently championed unconventionality, fearlessness, and thinking for oneself in public, Thiel’s vicious secret enmity against journalists is telling. His behavior is itself bullying, taken to the utmost degree.

Oculus Rift isn’t the only high-end virtual-reality system; the HTC Vive looks mighty impressive as well. The Vive demands a more complicated set-up, though, is more expensive, and involves walking around your room instead of standing mostly still, which might be more immersive, but will also result in more bruised shins.
Most of all, the Rift is exponentially more immersive than anything else on this list. The virtual environment responds when you lean in or out, or turn. The perspective shifts as though these things are actually in front of you. That might not sound like a lot, but to revisit an earlier analogy, it’s the difference between a burger and a prime steak.
If you’re still undeterred, here’s what that gets you: a standalone headset (no phone required) that delivers an experience that comes very close to making you forget where you are. Short films, games, a simulation of floating in space; all of these already exist for Rift in just the first few months of its existence. Plenty more is on the way.
And until then? There’s always Cardboard.
Here’s the catch, though! In a few years, Oculus Rift and HTC Vive will both look like the original Atari by the time Xbox came out. These aren’t just brand-new products, they’re a brand-new product category. That means there’s not much you can do with them yet, and the experiences are fun but unrefined. Unless you’re among the earliest of adopters, you’ll save yourself so much money and probably a few literal headaches by waiting a year or two before you invest heavily in VR.
Detective constable Rhiannon Daff said the Facebook tip was “a crucial part of the investigation.” Famuyide is now serving a 17-year jail sentence.
I have many favorite genres of online video, such as ‘Person Yelling About Sonic the Hedgehog’ and ‘Vape Trick Compilations Scored With EDM.’ But it’s rare to find any as purely pleasure-inducing and heartwarming as “Children and Teenagers Celebrating Disproportionately.”
In an article that appeared in Sunday’s New York Times, Jonathan Weisman, deputy editor in the Times’ Washington bureau, explains what it’s like to be targeted by a swarm of (ostensibly) Trump-supporting anti-Semitic Twitter-goons:
It’s a good read, and one of the interesting things about Weisman’s story is his ambivalence about telling it. “I retweeted the choicest attacks for all to see, and with each retweet, more attacks followed, their authors gleefully seeking the exposure,” he writes. “Some people criticized me for offering it, but I argued, perhaps wrongly, that such hate needed airing, that Americans needed to see the darkest currents in the politics of exclusion animating the presidential election.” Then, a bit later: “‘Thanks to @jonathanweisman for redpilling at least 1.5k normies today by retweeting premium content. Epitome of useful idiot,’ responded one tormentor whose Twitter handle is too vulgar to repeat, even if I wanted to. Maybe he was right.”
Weismen doesn’t mention 4chan by name, but it and the other chanboards are a major source of this sort of Twitter garbage, and they are the birthplaces of many of the memes most eagerly and obsessively embraced by alt-right Trumpkins. And if this thread on /pol/, the “politically incorrect” board that serves as one of the unofficial headquarters for Trump’s anti-Semitic online army, is any indication, some channers are in fact thrilled to have gotten coverage in the pages of the nation’s top newspaper, even if their home base wasn’t mentioned by name in the article (the thread appeared shortly after the article went online last week).
In other words: When you’re caught in a maelstrom of that sort of internet hate, you can’t win. Either you sit there and mute and block an endless cavalcade of idiots proudly announcing their desire to send you to the ovens, or you draw attention to their awfulness and give them exactly the attention they covet. These are the cases that stretch the logic of “Don’t feed the trolls” to the breaking point.
That’s because plenty of channers, in the thread on his story at least, seem to be emphasizing their common fear that 4chan will be infested by “normies” or “normalfags” — that is, well-adjusted humans who, by dint of their lack of knowledge of and experience in the weirder corners of online culture, could lower the quality of the board by posting lame jokes and memes that aren’t sufficiently dank. “REEEE shut it down! The normies know!” said one poster, for another. “FUCKING NORMIES STOP WRITING ARTICLES ABOUT MY BOARD REEEEEEEEEEEEE,” screamed another. “Every time a big news story links back to 4chan, a board is lost to newfags,” lamented a third.
“HOLY FUCK IM SHAKING A WHOLE NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE ABOUT US,” wrote one channer. “MEME MAGIC IS REAL,” enthused another. “We iz mainstream now,” stated another. But while it’s undoubtedly the case that some online trolls love the attention of a response or a retweet, and that an article like Weisman’s could inspire more troller, things aren’t quite as simple as “Weisman only gave these losers the attention they deserved.”
One channer took something of a middle path to the question of normie-infestation:
Happy Memorial Day!
It’s the Friday before Memorial Day, and much like everyone else, the internet seems to have checked out early. The meme well is empty; the viral-content stream has run dry. But your humble bloggers are, as all pioneers, hoarders: We keep with us many excellent web bits and bobs that we’ve found every week that we don’t have the time to write up, but that nonetheless deserve your amusement. Here are some of the best things we found this week, collected for your amusement.
“How I used lies about a cartoon to prove history is meaningless on the internet,” by Jordan Minor.
In or around 2003, Minor added a bunch of fake episodes (“Goin’ Clammando”) and cast listings (shark-jumper Henry Winkler) to the TV wiki TV Tome, which was then acquired by CBS Interactive. All of TV Tome’s data was imported into the more legit site TV.com, and now all of Minor’s fake information continues to float around the internet.
Brian Feldman: My favorite thing about it is that a major company bought a wiki? What an innocent time 2003 was, when a company could look at a user-run wiki and be like, “I bet nobody lied. Let’s import all the data.”
BF: The point is: I like it when people lie on the internet in innocuous ways, and this is a very good collective lie. I bet if we called up Henry Winkler and asked him about Street Sharks, he would say that he loved working on it.
Madison Malone Kircher: Goin’ Clammando! Lolol.
BF: Hard agree on that.
MMK: I mean, I for one thought he was great on Street Sharks.
Two nice bros help out another bro by passing him a Natty Ice.
BF: I hate Barstool Sports, but this is nice.
MMK: I am a woman, so I am also contractually obligated to hate Barstool Sports.
MMK: Oh wow, that’s a thought. I think if I ever saw the Oscar Mayer Weinermobile I’d be obliged to pass that guy an Ice. Because who needs a crappy beer more than the person behind the wheel of a giant hot dog? Though, let’s be real: The best thing in this video is the subtle Ja Rule underscoring.
BF: Who would you pass a Natty Ice to if you passed them on the highway?
MMK: ​*Shudders*​
BF: I’m a fan of how the RV says “WE INVENTED THE INTERNET” on the side, which is categorically false. Unless Barstool and DARPA are closer than we know.
Desert Canyon Middle School’s sixth-grade choir performed this nightmare-inducing choreographed rendition of Silentó’s “Watch Me” at their spring concert.
MMK: Let’s talk about something equally terrifying: these sixth-grade choir kids singing “Watch Me.” I think I account for a solid half of the views on YouTube.
BF: Oh yes. I only have one thought about this and the thought is: No, thank you!
MMK: But you have to watch it till the end at least once. The collective dab will make you weep for our future.
BF: I am already weeping constantly. Way ahead of you.
MMK: So woke.
Makeup artist uses chicken wings and sauce instead of actual makeup. Yes, you read that right.
BF: This is the first good makeup tutorial I’ve ever seen.
MMK: So many lost wings. To be honest, I think I’m too much of an autumn for that color palette. Might look nice on you, though.
BF: I am. Does she get a referral? Or commission? I mean commission.
BF: This tweet got ripped off a billion times, right? That’s a lot of lost income.
One thing that literally everyone agrees on is that people love ads. Can’t get enough of them. “More ads please!” —ad fans. And TV manufacturer Samsung has heard your calls. Last June, they began rolling out additional ads in the menus for their smart TVs (web-enabled sets with apps similar to an Apple TV or Roku) in the U.S. The program will soon expand to Europe as well, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The plan is to squeeze a bit more revenue out of the company’s declining TV business, which has seen sales drop six percent since that same quarter last year and currently maintains low single-digit margins.
As the owner of a Samsung smart TV, I can say anecdotally that I have no idea what this means — because I never use my TV’s smart features. The menu and interface are slow and sluggish and a chore to navigate. Dedicated hardware like an Apple TV or any other set-top box work much better. It’s worth the hassle of a second remote. So … good luck to Samsung, I guess? The TV picture is great — I used your apps once.
Last week, security researchers reported on a new North Korean website designed to look exactly like Facebook (The real Facebook is, shockingly, currently banned in the country.) But it only took a few hours and one Google-savvy teenager with a computer to hack into it.
Three years ago, before Yahoo paid too much money to acquire it, Tumblr got hacked. The precise extent of the hack was unclear, and Tumblr only found out about it this month, when it tersely announced a couple weeks ago “that a third party had obtained access to a set of Tumblr user email addresses with salted and hashed passwords from early 2013.” They forced users to reset their passwords.
Now, the damage from the hack has come to light, and it is substantial. Security researcher Troy Hunt told Motherboard that more than 65 million user names and hashed and salted passwords were taken from the social network (“hashed” means the data had been protected by converting it into a string of characters; “salted” means it’d been protected by including extraneous data). This makes the passwords difficult to decode, though not impossible. The data set is much more useful if you only need a list of 65 million email addresses and their accompanying incomprehensible text strings.
Like the recent reveal that 117 million LinkedIn accounts were compromised in 2012, the leak is another in what is a new type of hack, in which hackers acquire millions of credentials, and then lay low and out of sight for years. In some way, keeping the breach a secret is as important as getting past security measures in the first place. Data like this is next to useless if places like Tumblr can immediately inform their users.
The problem? The “Best Korean Social Network,” (catchy name, no?) got about as creative as your aunt who still has an AOL account when choosing a user name and password for the administrator account on the site. In fact, whoever set up the site didn’t bother to change them at all, instead opting to user the pre-set username, “Admin,” and pre-set password, “password,” which made it possible for Scottish college student Andrew McKean to hack, or more accurately, log, into the site, Motherboard reports.
McKean said getting into the admin account was simple after he discovered that the North Korean site appeared to have been built using phpDolphin, a program which makes it easy for anyone to build an off-the-shelf Facebook clone (think preexisting framework where you just have to add pertinent information without having to, you know, actually code your own social network.) Once he found the phpDolphin pre-sets, getting in was “easy enough,” and McKean says he had access to user accounts, the ability to censor content, and could have even changed the site name.
Moral of the story: For the love of Kim Jong-un, please stop using “password” as your password.
Fortunately for North Korea, McKean’s only change to the site was a small, sponsored message reading “Uh, I didn’t create this site just found the login.” Still, the site appears to have been taken down anyway.
While the company did not specify how many people were affected by the breach, a blog post from the hacker forum “Leaked Source” notes that upward of 350 million records were involved. The post also lists the top 50 passwords associated with the hack, which includes very original passwords of a mid-2000s vintage, like “blink182” and “50cent.”
In addition to changing their Myspace passwords, the company is recommending that users who have similar passwords on other websites reset those too. So go change your password, cringe at things you thought were cool in 2005, and maybe shake up your top eight while you’re at it. I’m guessing it has been a while.
This is just the latest in what is starting to feel like a never-ending string of hacks. Earlier today, Tumblr announced the platform had been hacked to the tune of 65 million user names and passwords. And LinkedIn has made headlines of late for an information breach involving over 100 million users. (Which followed a different breach involving six million passwords in 2012.)
Slack, the enormously successful team-messaging platform, might not seem totally intuitive if you’re not a 24-year-old who enjoys playing a daily game of ping-pong at an office with Monster Energy beverages packed four deep in the fridge. That’s where David Markovich, the 27-year-old behind ChatOverload, comes in. Markovich charges companies $1,000 per day to teach employees how to use everybody’s favorite email killer, Bloomberg reports.
Periscope is a broadcasting app that makes it easy for people to film and share live video, broadcasting it to an audience of friends or, often, strangers. One of the best (or worst) features about the app is the live feed of comments visible to both viewers and the person broadcasting — almost like an old episode of TRL. Like most (okay, all) comments sections online, the Periscope feed can easily get jammed with stupidity, spam, or, worse, harassment and abuse.
“It’s important to offer a path to rehabilitation,” Aaron Wasserman, a Periscope engineer, told Fast Company about the new jury system. “That person may not have intended for it to be as harmful as it really was. We’re inviting you to stick around and do better next time.”
In this light, Periscope’s new method — despite the fact that it’s a small twist on a millennia-old method for obtaining justice — is refreshing. Periscope’s parent company, Twitter, has faced a persistent and seemingly intractable harassment problem — spurred on in part by Twitter’s own inconsistent moderation, which ranges from heavy-handed to weak to just plain baffling — and it’s hard not to think that a similar system could lead to quicker and more satisfying outcomes in cases of abuse. As Periscope acknowledges, there’s no substitute for human perception to determine the causes and faults of culturally complicated interactions — an insight for which we can thank the ancient Greeks.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is advising that people stop taking selfies with seals, or “sealfies” (ouch). “Getting too close to a wild animal puts you — and the animal — at risk. Seals have powerful jaws, and can leave a lasting impression,” NOAA explains on its website.
In case getting bitten was’t enough to turn you off from taking said selfies, NOAA also explains that seal mothers will often leave their pups alone for extended periods while they hunt. If a mother sees a human interacting with a pup, she may abandon it. And is there anything sadder than the thought of a tiny, abandoned seal? (Yes, this dolphin in Argentina who died after tourists picked it up and took selfies with it.) Stop taking animal selfies, people.
If you do spot a seal, NOAA recommends staying about 150 feet away. Which is a lot farther than most of the people did whose sealfies we found on Twitter.
There are only a handful of major tech companies less press-friendly than Amazon, which is legendary for its frequent refusal to comment to or speak with (or often even acknowledge) reporters. Last October, Amazon spokesman Jay Carney published a lengthy and aggressive rebuttal to a long New York Times investigative story about Amazon’s workplace environment — in the process publishing emails from the reporter, Jodi Kantor, and accusing one of the Times’ sources of fraud. In other words, if you were looking for a free-press hero among tech barons, Amazon’s founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, probably isn’t the first guy on your list.
But Bezos is more than a tech baron — he’s also a press baron, thanks to his 2013 purchase of the Washington Post, and he appears to be growing into that role quite well. Last night, at Recode’s Code conference, Bezos earned himself an enormous amount of goodwill among the media class, showing his confidence in the Post as an institution and paraphrasing Confucius to disparage tech investor Peter Thiel’s decadelong crusade to destroy Gawker Media by funding lawsuits against the company. “Seek revenge and you should dig two graves — one for yourself. You have to ask yourself how you want to spend your time,” he told the audience. “The best defense against speech that you don’t like about yourself as a public figure is to develop a thick skin,” he said.
Tycoons controlling media is hardly a new thing, but compare Bezos’s stewardship of the post with the slow-burning fire happening at the Las Vegas Review-Journal, which is caught between maintaining journalistic integrity and its new and interfering owner, Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson. No such conflict has emerged at the Post — yet — and Bezos seems to at least have an solid understanding of the challenges facing the newspaper industry, and experience dealing with them.
A representative from Airbnb told Select All that the company was “horrified” to read the host’s messages and that the host has since been banned from the site.
Airbnb is no stranger to stories of discrimination. Earlier in May, people of color on Twitter shared experiences like being declined rentals for seemingly no reason, or having the cops called under the assumption that black guests were “robbing the place,” using the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack, (Many of the people who shared Jane’s story on Twitter did so using this hashtag.) A Harvard study in 2015 found that people with names that “sounded African-American” had a harder time renting on Airbnb. And this spring, Gregory Selden, a 25-year-old black man, filed a lawsuit against the company, arguing that it violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Selden says he was denied a room from an Airbnb host, the same room he was later able to book after changing his Airbnb profile avatar to a picture of a white man.
From Jane, via Alicia’s blog:
At the very least, Jane hopes the company will be more thorough in vetting its hosts. “Screen more! Screen the hosts, screen the language that passes through the platform. Screen screen screen,” she said.
A previous version of this post stated that Bezos bought the Post in 2014. It has been updated with the correct year, 2013.
Nothing says Rest in Peace like a face with stuck-out tongue and winking-eye emoji. Just ask the family of Carmen Bustamante Barangó. Before she died at the end of May, the 75-year-old Barcelona native asked that her family include the emoji in her obituary, El Pais reports.
El Pais reports that 😜 (again, that’s the face with stuck-out tongue and winking-eye emoji, not to be confused with the regular, boring winking-eye emoji) was Carmen’s favorite emoji during her time on Earth. She apparently also told her family that while she wanted the emoji included, she did not want her family to use any religious imagery in her obituary. She even threatened to haunt them if they disobeyed. (Insert ghost emoji here.)
Fortunately for Carmen (and those of us in the viral-internet-content biz), her family respected her emoji wishes and the 75-year-old is now, we can only assume, resting peacefully in the great big Unicode Consortium in the sky.
Just ask the family of Carmen Bustamante Barangó. Before she died at the end of May, the 75-year-old Barcelona native asked that her family include the emoji in her obituary, El Pais reports.
Clips of both the rugged-looking sponges have long been popular within the SpongeBob fandom, and Know Your Meme traces the first appearance of the Primitive Sponge meme back to Twitter user @SpongeBobGetsIt back in 2015. But for some reason, perhaps heat of the summer sun or Mercury’s retrograde, it has been having something of a second coming in recent weeks in certain pockets of Reddit, Twitter, and Tumblr. Consult Google Trends and you’ll see a sharp spike in searches for terms like “Caveman SpongeBob” and “Spongegar” starting around May. (Unfortunately for Primitive Sponge, people are searching for that term with significantly less fervor. Probably because they didn’t read this meme guide.)
Primitive Sponge is, maybe unsurprisingly, the second SpongeBob SquarePants–related meme to take over the internet this year, following the classic Confused Mr. Krabs. (In case you’re not familiar, the Mr. Krabs meme involves a series of images of Mr. Krabs surrounded by a blurry circle and is often accompanied with the punch line “when you just wake up from a nap.”)
Of course, as with all great internet fodder, nothing can stay meme gold forever. Which leaves us wondering: Will we have to look further back than the Paleozoic to find the next great piece of the internet?
Maybe it’s his aggressive stance, or the way his fingers are flexed, as though ready to claw into an underwater woolly mammoth at a moment’s notice, but there is something about Primitive Sponge that makes it clear that the little yellow Porifera has seen some serious stuff. You understand Primitive Sponge, because you’ve been there.
To fully understand the meme, it’s important to know that there are two related, but distinct, sponges: Primitive Sponge, the loincloth-wearing sponge whose underbite-afflicted mug has become the face of the movement, and his more recent counterpart, Spongegar, who sports a one-shouldered animal-print cloak, a unibrow, and a generally less menacing demeanor. Spongegar is a more highly evolved sponge, but that works against him: When you need to represent the sensation of primal panic, you don’t want the goofy smile.
Primitive Sponge comes from an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants called “SB-129,” which aired during the show’s first season back in 1999, where SpongeBob, and his best friend, Patrick Star, roam the sea floor during the Cambrian era. Spongegar (again, flanked by his best friend Patar) didn’t appear onscreen until 2004 in a episode entitled “Ugh.” (Primitive Sponge also has a cameo appearance in the 2004 episode.)
Two defining characteristics of the alt-right, the loosely organized online coalition of meme-loving racists, are that its members like being weird online and aren’t particularly fond of Jews. Keep those two things in mind, and the following discussion of a punctuation meme might make more sense.
As Fleishman and Smith explain, “The symbol comes from right-wing blog the Right Stuff, whose podcast The Daily Shoah featured a segment called ‘Merchant Minute’ that gave Jewish names a cartoonish ‘echo’ sound effect when uttered. The ‘parenthesis meme,’ as Right Stuff editors call it, is a visual pun.” As the Mic authors note, that same blog also explains on one page that “all Jewish surnames echo through history,” meaning that — and this is Fleishman and Smith again — “the supposed damage caused by Jewish people reverberates from decade to decade.” The idea is that it’s a “silly” way to make Jewish names sound evil and sinister, in other words.
Yesterday, Mic published an article in which Cooper Fleishman and Anthony Smith traced the history of a weird thing some alt-righters do online: They’ll put multiple parentheses around Twitter-targets’ names to indicate that they’re Jewish. It’s never happened to me, but as the New York Times’ Jonathan Weisman explained in a recent column, he got a tweet which read “Hello ((Weisman)).” It seems to be a way of saying something like “Ha, look at this Jew!,” and is often followed by a wave of the alt-right’s now-standard meme-drenched anti-Semitism.
It’s an interesting — if that’s the right word — origin story and a good rundown. But Fleishman and Smith end up overanalyzing things a bit when they argue that the parentheses help alt-right folks obscure their online anti-Semitism. “To the public, the symbol is not easily searchable on most sites and social networks; search engines strip punctuation from results,” they write at one point. “This means that trolls committed to uncovering, labeling and harassing Jewish users can do so in relative obscurity: No one can search those threats to find who’s sending them.” In a subheadline farther down in the piece, they ask “How have these trolls been able to hide harassment in plain sight?,” and then answer their own question by referring back to the parentheses-search issue. Then, toward the end of the article, they write that “Whether they know it or not, Neo-Nazis on Twitter have discovered a brilliant loophole — a code that’s difficult to filter whose meaning incites waves of hate before the target realizes what’s happening.”
None of this jibes with what we know about how the alt-right operates on Twitter. For one thing, this group loves the attention they get from their online anti-Semitism — its members have no interest in “obscurity,” relative or otherwise. In fact, when Weisman asked the person who tweeted the parentheses at him what it meant, they explained and seemed quite impressed with themselves. For another thing, plenty of the tweets that use the parentheses — including one embedded in the Mic article itself — are explicitly anti-Semitic, or if they aren’t they are quickly followed by tweets which are. Plus, Twitter accounts dedicated to online anti-Semitism don’t tend to hide that fact in their online handles and profiles. All of this renders the parentheses’ mystery a lot less mysterious. (And this is all ignoring the fact that there’s little need to “hide” anti-Semitism on Twitter anyway, since Twitter rarely takes any sort of aggressive action against it — even, anecdotally at least, after it’s been reported.)
To find out more about Primitive Sponge’s sudden ascension into the realm of top memes like Dat Boi and bees (which are, in case you’ve forgotten, dying globally at an alarming rate), I consulted the person behind @CavemansSponge, a Twitter account devoted entirely to Primitive Sponge memes. Its creator, a 21-year-old who asked to remain anonymous, says the Primitive Sponge account is the latest in a “huge network” of Twitter accounts they run as a full-time job. It’s only been a week since the account was created, and already the follower count has jumped to 162,000. “I noticed right when I started posting on this account everyone was already hyped and talking about it [Primitive Sponge],” they said. (For the record, the creator tells me this growth was “all organic,” and that they didn’t buy any of their followers. Sure.) “It’s a funny, relatable meme,” they explained. “The face he makes is hilarious.”
You have become Primitive Sponge.
In recent weeks, Primitive Sponge has exploded in popularity. The premise is fairly simple: Take a relatable situation in which a person might might be surprised, scared, or generally in the throes of an immediate, survival-threatening crisis — discovering someone stole your lunch from the office fridge, say, or getting caught in flagrante delicto — and add a picture of SpongeBob SquarePants’ prehistoric alter-ego, Primitive Sponge.
Bloomberg reports this morning that Snapchat, the ephemeral photo-and-video app popular among people younger than you, is now outpacing Twitter in its number of daily active users. According to Bloomberg’s sources, the app brings in 150 million users per day, up from 110 million just six months ago. Twitter, on the other hand, has a daily user base that’s currently hovering around 140 million.
Snapchat’s meteoric rise (it’s not even half as old as Twitter, which turned 10 this spring) can be attributed to many factors — it’s fun, it’s well-designed, it’s got an enormous amount of new content daily from the Kardashian family. But one reason it’s outpacing Twitter in particular is the fact that it doesn’t suffer from a problem known as “context collapse.” The temporary nature of its posts means less baggage and anxiety for users. Other platforms, like Twitter and Facebook, on the other hand, force users to consider a multitude of questions every time they type in the status box or upload a picture: Do I want my family to see this? Do I want my boss to see this? Do I want to see this two years from now?
That problem of juggling different audiences under one online identity doesn’t really exist on Snapchat. Your account is public, but, unlike on Twitter, there’s no discovery and no sharing; no strangers will accidentally stumble upon it and misinterpret your jokes. Unlike on Facebook, the process of choosing the friends who receive your snaps and messages is intuitive and built in to the process. Most of all, it’s based around data that by design won’t hurt you forever.
Nobody asked Musk who his weed dealer is.
The dog in the picture, Kram, is owned by a South Carolina teen named Matthew. “The reason I made that sign was because many have broken my car window in the past because they think they are being ‘heroes’ when in reality, I only went in the store for less than 5 minutes to grab a pack of cigs or whatever I need,” the 16-year-0ld told me via Twitter DM. “The sign is an inside joke between me and my friends.” And like any good viral joke, the tweet has spawned copycats (or dogs, as it were), with people replacing Kram’s “favorite music” with various bands and songs.
Since Matthew tweeted the photo at the end of May, the picture has been retweeted by over 55,000 people, with one question weighing heavily on the minds of many: What exactly is the dog’s favorite music?
“Our rebranding to tronc represents the manner in which we will pool our technology and content resources to execute on our strategy,” Tribune Chairman Michael Ferro explains. And how. tronc!
Tribune, a national publishing powerhouse that has undergone some, erm, trouble over the last few years, is also facing a lawsuit from shareholders after it rejected two purchase offers from rival newspaper publisher Gannett this spring. But let’s not talk about about that. Let’s talk about tronc. tronc — it rolls off the tongue. “tronc” is an abbreviation of “tribune online content” — but, of course, it’s so much more besides. What does tronc stand for? I will let tronc tell you.
Anyway: It’s tronc, baby! So kick back, grab an ice-cold tronc from the cooler and crack it open. Enjoy tronc.
Tronc is here. Can you feel the excitement? Or rather, Tronc will be here. Tronc (stylized: “tronc”) is the new name of Tribune Publishing, the media conglomerate that owns a number of regional newspapers, perhaps most importantly the Los Angeles Times.
The company will also launch “troncX, our content curation and monetization engine, to combine existing assets with new artificial intelligence (‘AI’) technology to accelerate digital growth. The Company conducted a 30-day pilot of its AI efforts involving 1% of its traffic, delivering a 400% increase in the yield on programmatic revenue.” What does this mean? I think it means: Blogging. Or … ads? But also: tronc.
Unfortunately, we may never know what music this particular dog was listening to from inside his air-conditioned hangout. Select All previously reported that the dog was named Kram and was owned by a South Carolina teen named Matthew. But sadly, it has come to light that Matthew actually took the photo from somewhere else on the internet and repurposed it as his own.
Update: Like many news organizations before us, we have been brutally hoaxed by a teenager we met on Twitter. The viral locked-car dog is (probably) not named Kram, and (probably) not listening to Rihanna, as we originally reported based on an interview with the person who first shared the photo. The post has been updated throughout to reflect this.
Despite being a fake — or at least, not an original — the tweet has still managed to spawn copycats (or dogs, as it were), with people replacing the dog formerly believed to be Kram’s “favorite music” with various bands and songs.
Copypasta — eternally copied-and-pasted memes, stories, warnings, and urban legends — is a tradition as old the internet itself. Or at least as old as 2004. Today, there’s a new viral status making its way online thanks to moms, dads, and people all over the world with well-intentioned but misguided concerns about web safety.
The status is similar to one that circulated in 2012 and also warned people about Facebook “pirates.” (You can read about it on Snopes here.) A discussion thread on Facebook’s Help Community notes that this status started surfacing nearly two months ago on the platform. For some reason, it has taken on new life this week.
The “hack” the status describes is a common internet problem known better as cloning, in which a person will use a photo of you to create a fictitious account under your name. From there, they can add your friends and send them the classic “I am trapped in a foreign country/prison/closet, please send $5,000” messages, in the hopes that since the new profile looks like their friend (real), they might send actually send the cash to the friend (fake).
So while the “fair warning” is well-intentioned, that status isn’t really doing you a whole lot of good. (Not to mention the not-at-all spammy copy/paste instructions included at the end, which really lend some gravitas to the situation.) You’re better off spending some time fiddling with your privacy settings so that your profile picture and list of friends are not visible to the general public, making it at least somewhat more difficult for someone to clone your account.
Two decades into the bonkers experiment known as the World Wide Web, regular users have come to accept the fact that the internet is nasty. Even the most well-intentioned conversations on social media can (and usually do) take a hairpin turn into insults, trolling, and harassment. One of the primary rules for a halfway-decent web-surfing experience is to “never read the comments.” It’s generally assumed that you can’t have a large presence online without attracting the worst of the web.
But it doesn’t have to be this way. There are spaces on the web which have, against all odds, constructed large, pure, and kind communities. It might sound impossible, but there is a community out there, with a staggering 1.4 million members, that is entirely free of invective and vitriol. A light in the darkness. A rapturous joy. I am talking about the Old Friends Senior Dog Sanctuary, the only pure spot on the web.
Four years ago, a half hour from Nashville in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, Zina Goodin and her husband, Michael, established the Old Friends Senior Dog Sanctuary as a way to take care of aging dogs. “Once we bring a dog into our program they’re with us for life,” Zina says. “and we make sure they stay in loving homes and among family members until they pass away. We also keep about 60 dogs with us here at the sanctuary,” a sprawling five acres.
Along with the sanctuary’s establishment, Zina set up a Facebook page, which is perfect in every single way. I have seen nothing like it in all of my time on social media. A community of more than a million people, who just compliment, and share pictures of, dogs. Every single photo posted to the page gets hundreds of comments and thousands of likes. It is only positive vibes about flawless creatures, like Leo here.
“I thought that I could tell good stories about senior dogs and the dogs that went through our program, to show people that senior dogs weren’t just old dogs waiting to die.” Zina recalled. “They were able to have a good life, have fun, be family members and really benefit the family they lived with.” Zina does almost all of the Facebook posting, and for the most part, her strategy has remained consistent over the last four years.
Every single comment thread is like this. It is wonderful.
Facebook allows users to pay in order to “boost” posts, increasing the likelihood that they’ll appear in a user’s news feed. Zina says that Old Friends has only ever boosted posts meant to sell merchandise in order to raise funds — the facility is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. The interactions on the usual dog photos, however, are all organic.
“I hit my first 50 likes and I was freaking out,” Zina recalled. “I thought that was the greatest thing ever. We kinda poked along for the first year. I think we hit 500 that fall, and then by the end we might’ve been to a couple thousand likes.” Then, in 2014, Old Friends started seeing its largest jumps, and for the past year or so, the page’s following has been going up around one percent every week, which is a significant, consistent gain given its audience size.
Part of the reason people keep coming back to Old Friends is that — there’s no other way to put this — an honest-to-god internet fandom has developed around the dogs. After a BuzzFeed post celebrating Old Friends this past January, even Tumblr took up the reins in its own oddball way.
That Old Friends has managed to scale and maintain what can only be described as purity is a testament to Zina’s social-media skill and perseverance, the power of dogs, and the innate kindness of people. Amidst private messages about senior dog rescue and animal care, or information about the facility, the inbox also fills with messages like, “I love Leo, please give him a hug for me.”
Keeping the Old Friends page positive is, according to Zina, pretty easy work. She doesn’t have to moderate comments heavily, partially because she tries to keep it light. Occasionally, dogs will pass on and obituaries will be posted, but the snapshots of daily life rarely focus on the maladies plaguing these elderly pets.
There is, however, one event that consistently brings out the angry and the grouchy. “There’s never anything negative except when Leo gets a haircut,” Zina says. “They think we should never shave Leo. (Leo disagrees.)”
That’s the beauty of the Old Friends Senior Dogs sanctuary, where the worst thing that could happen is that somebody gets a haircut.
This post has nearly 90,000 notes (interactions such as likes and re-blogs) on it.
Virtual reality is great. It’s fine. It’s the future, whatever. But I know something even better than virtual reality: strapping a VR headset on your adorable granny and filming her reaction. Because that is what innovation is really all about. Overwhelming the people closest to you and publicizing it for a few hundred upvotes on Reddit.
In a video making the rounds on the /r/videos subreddit today, watch as an unsuspecting Irish grandmother (wearing an adorable pair of leopard-print slippers no less) experiences virtual reality for the first time.
Is there any gadget more irritating to shop for than headphones? Amazon has more than 200,000 varieties that pop up in a simple search; even the Wirecutter, the paragon of direct and blunt single-item recommendations, suggests some two dozen headphones across multiple categories and price points. If you’re an obsessive gearhead — the kind that likes to set aside an hour in the evening to properly research, across magazines and archived message boards, your product purchases — this is great. But if you just want headphones, the prospect of finding the right pair is daunting. Do you want in-ear, on-ear, or over-ear? Open-back or closed-? What kind of music do you listen to? What kind of bass response do you want? Do you prefer warm, dark, heavy, light sound?
I mean, of course it matters. There are hundreds of audiophiles probably already emailing me. So I should be clear: If you have sensitive and sophisticated ears, or if you have an enormous library of records and a several-thousand-dollar setup and want to make sure you’re listening to your LPs at the highest possible fidelity, you probably should be considering the many vectors of sound quality that audiophilia obligates you to. And if you’re the kind of consumer who just likes to have the “best” in a given category, I won’t stop you.
I give you: The Panasonic RP-HT21 on-ear stereo headphones, currently $5.33 from Amazon. They look impossibly dorky, yes; but headphones are, like bike helmets, inherently dorky, and any attempts to dress them up fashionably just calls attention to the wearer’s insecurity. They are “on-ear” headphones, yes, which means that if you have particularly sensitive ears you won’t want to wear them for more than a couple hours at a time — but my guess is that you wouldn’t be doing that anyway. Will they break? Maybe, probably (my pair, which I wear daily, have been going strong for four months) — but they only cost five bucks! Most importantly, they sound great, they’re cheap as hell, you can hang ‘em around your neck when you’re not listening, and you don’t have to read anything about how “warm” the sound is. Except what you just did.
So my recommendation isn’t for the sophisticated audio palate. It’s for someone who mostly just listens to MP3s and streams music and needs to replace (or slightly upgrade) their iPhone’s earbuds. More than anything it’s for someone prone to losing or breaking their headphones. It’s the $15 table wine for the home-cooked weeknight dinner of Spotify.
But generally speaking, headphones are like wine. If you’re not an expert, if you’re not rich, and if you don’t need to impress anyone, you’re going to get as much use and enjoyment out of the best stuff at the cheap end of the spectrum as you will out of the stuff that costs ten times as much. While there’s an obvious difference between your tinny bodega earbuds and an expensive pair of Sennheisers, gradations in quality, especially once you’ve reached a certain level, can be difficult to gauge, even to trained ears. It’s no accident that no other consumer tech category is more greased with snake oil — expensive boondoggles like this $10,000 ethernet cable, or this $180 “nano liquid contact enhancer.” What sounds heavenly to one person can sound dull and flat to another.
I am here to tell you that none of that really matters.
According to the video’s caption, she’s trying out Jurassic Park. So watch this again and picture some very big dinosaurs. Or Chris Pratt in a formfitting cargo vest. Whichever makes you scream louder.
To anyone who was ever a teenage girl (or boy for that matter, gender is bogus), Judy Blume, creator of seminal YA classics like Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret and Tales of Fourth Grade Nothing, is a national hero. But it turns out, even heroes make mistakes sometimes. The author joined Tumblr earlier this year while publicizing her latest work, but it seems she’s still a little bit fuzzy on how the microblogging platform spells its name.
“Did it again!” AGAIN! There is something adorable about picturing the 78-year-old sitting at her computer (which I imagine is a sensible iMac G4) and repeatedly misspelling Tumblr. It’s okay, Judy. I still love you, extra vowels and all.
This has been a trying week for our beloved internet. The highly anticipated Instagram algorithm apocalypse happened. Myspace got hacked. Tumblr got hacked. The Tribune Publishing Company got hacked. I’m sorry, I meant to say the Tribune Publishing Company got rebranded … as Tronc. All in, it’s been a bleak few days and I, for one, am stunned we made it out the other side.
Starting this week, the algorithmic feed-ranking that Instagram announced back in March will roll out to all users. Until now, users’ feeds have been presented in a strict chronological order. That’ll change to a weighted ranking system, similar to how the Facebook news feed works now, presenting what the system believes you’d most prefer to see.
The announcement of an algorithmic feed sent users and brands reliant on Instagram into a tizzy. For a few days in March, it seemed like every account had a photo pointing up and to the right instructing users how to turn on per-account notifications.
As we said a couple of months ago and will reiterate here, this doesn’t really matter for photo viewers. The algorithmic weighting Instagram uses isn’t starting from scratch — you don’t need to train it as to what you like and don’t like. Brands reliant on getting their message out there, however, are in a slightly different boat, and to that end, Instagram is rolling out more tools for business.
Thankfully, there remains a great, furry hope for saving the web from destroying itself with garbage content. So, in no particular order, may I present the only good things that happened online this week: Dogs.
First up, we have this little guy who is clearly the salsa king of whatever pet store he is currently chilling at. (Side note, if you know where Select All can purchase this dog, please let us know.)
Find someone who looks at you the way this dog is looking at ice cream.
Next on the roster, we have this dog wearing goggles. Which needs no other editorializing, because it is a dog wearing goggles.
And finally, let this dog chilling on a pool float calm your inner demons.
If you are still not feeling better about the state of the digital world, you can head over here and read this excellent interview with a founder of the Old Friends Senior Dog Sanctuary, the “last pure place online.” If that doesn’t make you feel happy to be alive, you are probably already dead.
In case the recent hacks of Myspace, Tumblr, LinkedIn, and, um, this North Korean Facebook clone, weren’t enough to convince you to up your password game, let Mark Zuckerberg be a cautionary tale.
Over the weekend, Zuck’s Pinterest and Twitter accounts were hacked by the OurMine Team, a group that also is taking credit for a LinkedIn hack that compromised several million people back in May, Gizmodo reports. The group was allegedly able to gain access to his accounts using a password mined from the LinkedIn hack. Which mean, yes, the founder of one of the world’s largest social media platforms likely got busted for using the same password across multiple websites. (Mom, if you’re reading this, that is a bad idea. Don’t be like Zuck.)
In a now-deleted tweet from his Twitter account, the hackers claimed that Zuckerberg’s password was “dadada,” though we’re giving Zuckerberg the benefit of the doubt on that one. OurMine also claims they succeeded in hacking Zuckerberg’s Instagram account, but there does not appear to be proof of such a breach and Facebook is denying it happened, Gizmodo also reports. (In case you’ve forgotten, Facebook owns Instagram these days.)
Zuckerberg wasn’t the only target this weekend. Several other high-profile Twitter accounts were temporarily compromised, the Verge reports, including Tenacious D. The group’s account was hacked by someone with a charming send of humor, who decided to trick followers into believing actor Jack Black had died. (Jack Black, to our knowledge, is alive and well. Though he might want to change his passwords.)
As of Monday morning, things appear to have returned to normal on Zuck’s hacked accounts. Which means he’s back to never tweeting (he hasn’t since 2012); meanwhile, all three of his Pinterest boards have been restored to their former glory.
Like many people who spent their Memorial Day weekend at the beach, I spent the following week generously applying moisturizer, and wincing when I moved, because of an unintended sunburn. (Note to self: Remember to apply sunscreen to the backs of knees next time.)
But Sunscreenr, a tiny, waterproof camera, wants to make sunburns a thing of the past. You apply sunscreen and then have a friend look through the device’s viewfinder. While you can’t see sunscreen with the naked eye, areas of skin that aren’t adequately covered will appear lighter through the device, its creators claim. (Read: You’ll know where you need to slather some more SPF.) If you don’t have somebody with you, Sunscreenr is also selfie-stick-compatible (it is 2016, after all) and you can record up to 30 seconds of video to review.
The device is currently being funded via Kickstarter and raised $30,000 more than the campaign’s initial goal of $45,000. (The Kickstarter closes at the end of June.) Looks like I’m not the only one Googling ways to never get another sunburn.
As the school year winds down, we have reached the tail end of prom season, when seniors across the nation get to live it up one last time before going to college or joining the workforce. It’s one of the very last chances to do something weird and arbitrary and funny.
Take this past weekend for example, when senior Chris Burwell took a copy of the Nintendo GameCube game Super Smash Bros. Melee to prom. Photos of Chris started going viral over the weekend, racking up hundreds of likes and shares on Facebook, and thousands of notes on Tumblr.
I guess the first question is, why did you take a copy of Super Smash Bros. to prom?
When did you decide this?
I’m a big fan of the game. There’s a big fan base for Super Smash Bros. Melee specifically, and I’ve been a fan of the game for a long time. I saw a couple weeks ago that a guy took his waifu to prom, and I thought, That’s very funny, but I’m not that bad. What else could I do? And I thought I’ll take Melee, because there’s such a big fan base and I’m one of those fans. It felt right. It was the heat of the moment.
We had a few questions, so we called up Chris (whose preferred fighter is Marth) to find out why he brought the 2001 video-game classic to the most important high school event. (There are more pictures below the interview.)
Did you ever considering asking another classmate or something, or was it always going to be Smash?
Literally the day of the prom.
So walk me through it. How did you arrive at prom?
It was always going to be Smash. I’m not, like, a total loser, but I don’t know any girls that I would take.
I went with a group of friends. We all pitched in and rented a party bus. We got to the park at six, we all took pictures and everything, and so I had my mom take pictures of me with my disc and the case and everything. When it was time to go, I realized — because they search you when you get to the prom, because you can’t bring in anything against the rules — it would be a long thing to explain bringing the disc in a full case, so I took the disc out and wrapped it in a napkin. I put it in my jacket pocket and I just had the disc the whole night.
How did your friends and chaperones react?
I’m bad with estimating numbers, but I’d say it’s a couple hundred.
How many people were at the prom.
I feel like none of my friends or the people that knew me were all that surprised. They know me, they know my humor. It was a really good conversation-starter. “Hey, what’s going on?” “Oh, that’s my date, Super Smash Bros. Melee for the Nintendo GameCube.” It’s like, no one’s loyal these days but Melee’s always there for you. People were mostly pretty chill with it; they just thought it was funny.
Did you … dance?
Yes, I did. There were two different areas. There was a place where there was a band for slow-dancing. I didn’t do that but there was a DJ in another place so I was bouncing around and doing all that.
I first put it on a Facebook group I’m part of called Melee Hell. It’s like 18,000 members, we’re all just fans of Melee. It’s just memes and jokes and stuff like that. I figured, “I’ll put it up here because people like the game and I won’t get destroyed for doing this.” It just blew up. I uploaded my very first picture on the way to the prom, just me and the disc, and it got a ton of likes. So then it’s like, “Oh, this is something that I should roll with.”
Do you regret it at all?
Yesterday, you put some of these pictures online. What has the response been like?
No, man. I had the time of my life. This was my first high school dance — I never did anything like that before. I was just like, “I’m gonna go, it’s my last year, I’m a senior. This will be my first prom, I should do something memorable.” I think that’s very memorable and I don’t regret it at all.
Then it got even bigger, so I put it on Twitter and Tumblr. The response has been … Melee Hell is just like, “You’re my hero,” but the response on Twitter and Tumblr has been like, “This is kinda sad.” I should expect that.
In high school, you’re always trying to be something you’re not, or trying to conform. Just do whatever. No one cares about anything. In the end, this does not affect my life positively or negatively. Just do what you want.
This interview has been condensed and edited.
Thanks to a Mic article about it that was published last week, a Chrome extension called Coincidence Detector has gotten a fair amount of attention over the last few days. Coincidence Detector is extremely creepy: It draws on a database of names of (purported) Jews and automatically adds Jew-parentheses around those names when they show up in the user’s browser. “John Smith,” to take an unlikely example, would show up as “(((John Smith)))” — a winking in-joke among online anti-Semites (particularly alt-righters) indicating that, hey, this guy is Jewish.
This is a delicate argument, so it’s important to be really specific: Obviously, it is vital to vigilantly monitor anti-Semitism in the U.S. and everywhere else. This is especially true now, given that in recent years it has become increasingly difficult to be Jewish in Europe, where hatred of Jews is disturbingly common both in some of the recently resurgent far-right parties clawing to power in the recession-scarred E.U. political landscape and among certain subsets of the continent’s growing Muslim population. So I’m all for raising the alarm bells about any sign of rising anti-Semitism — any attack on a Jew or a synagogue should get coverage. “Never forget” may be a cliché, but it’s an important imperative that can’t ever be, well, forgotten.
For anyone who is Jewish (I am), there is a dark, murderous history to the practice of maintaining lists of Jews — a history that stretches back through millennia of persecution, pogroms, mass murder, and forced migration. So it’s completely understandable why some might find this extension scary.
When it comes to app and extension downloads, 3,000 isn’t all that far off, statistically, from zero. Very few people downloaded this extension. If I told you that there are anti-Semitic people in the world who make lists of Jews, that wouldn’t surprise you (hell, do a Google search for “Jew list” and you’ll find stuff as old as the internet itself). If I told you that there are enough of them that 3,000 would download a Chrome extension feeding on their obsession, that wouldn’t surprise you either. It’s unclear, in short, exactly what new or newsworthy threat Coincidence Detector represents that would lead anyone to be all that concerned about it. That doesn’t mean Mic shouldn’t have covered it — in both the Coincidence Detector article and another one they published last week explaining Jew-parentheses, authors Cooper Fleishman and Anthony Smith did some valuable excavation of the worst corners of the internet — but rather than that we need to develop some perspective. Given how easy it is for anyone to spew hatred online, we need to be better at triaging, better at discerning strains of hatred that demand a forceful response from those which are best ignored. Coincidence Detector, gross as it is, sat firmly in the latter category.
“The extension has 2,473 users and boasts a rating of 5 out of 5 stars,” noted Mic. “It is connected to a database of names that is regularly updated.” The article also explained that the “coincidence” part is ironic, in the sense of It sure is a coincidence there are so many Jewish people in positions of power. (After the Mic article, Google yanked Coincidence Detector down from its extension marketplace.)
But when it comes to the world of anonymous online fuckery, there’s a line to be walked. It really is quite easy for faceless jerks who don’t represent anyone to get more attention than they warrant by targeting cultural pressure points pertaining to harassment, hatred, and so forth. In this case, all we know is that some asshole made a list of Jews and an extension drawing on that list, and that a grand total of less than 3,000 other assholes around the world downloaded it, with the end result being … some parentheses were added to a bunch of names. Maybe some of the extension’s users then tweeted at the Jewish figures whose names were parenthesized, I guess, but the extension itself didn’t even do anything to its targets — all it did was puke up some stupid parentheses, at which point the user presumably chuckled to himself and hit refresh on a Stormfront forum.
And yet: I wish people would ignore garbage like this. Nobody gains anything by panicking about it, and there’s solid reason to think it will only rile up trolls who have shown little evidence of exhibiting any offline power or influence.
Do you own an iPhone? (If the answer is yes, please skip immediately to the below video and feel good about your device choice.) If not, please watch Apple’s latest ad, which features a majestic hippo swimming in Botswana, and let it immediately show you the error of your cell-phone ways. (Turn your sound on.)
As we’ve covered before, the Streisand Effect is a known web phenomenon where someone, in an attempt to reduce attention to something, actually increases said attention. It is named after a 2003 incident in which Barbra Streisand attempt to pull images of her home from the web, in turn causing more people to distribute those pictures. It happened again when Beyoncé tried to remove images of her performance during Super Bowl XLVII, in 2013.
Axl Rose does not know about the Streisand Effect. Last week, according to TorrentFreak, representatives for the Guns N’ Roses singer attempted to have removed, from Google, an unflattering photo of Rose that had been turned into a meme. The meme, known unofficially as Fat Axl Rose, is not particularly good. Imagine a bunch of groan-worthy food puns made from GNR lyrics. That’s the meme.
It’s not entirely clear who owns the copyright to the image. The original photo was shot by Boris Minkevich in 2010, but Rose claims that photographers authorized for the show signed the rights over. (Taylor Swift had a similar arrangement with photographers at her concerts.) Even if he had not signed the rights over, that would call into question whether they were authorized at all.
And yet here I am, telling you about Fat Axl Rose, because he tried to pull the photos from Google. Six DMCA notices like this one were filed in total.
Trying to pull memed images from the web is never a good move, in part because it just forces more attention onto them, and because it’s a virtually impossible task. Celebrities would do well to take a page from the playbook of Michael Jordan, star of the Crying Jordan meme (and former NBA player). A publicist told the New York Times what Jordan thinks of his namesake meme: “Michael actually thinks it’s funny.” Lean in to memes, celebs.
The ad is one of eight released today as part of Apple’s ongoing “Shot on an iPhone” campaign. (As the name implies, all the footage in the ads was, yes, shot using an iPhone camera.) The rest of the clips, which range from penguins in Antarctica to bees in Australia, are fine. But really, take our word for it and just watch the damn hippo.
Autumn Black is a high-school sophomore from Florida. And, last week, Black learned something important in class: It’s a good idea to double check that a pen is closed before running it over your leg repeatedly.
Airbnb has a race problem. Black users have had rentals declined by hosts for no reason other than their race; some have had the police called on them while in the midst of a rental. These stories and others have been shared on Twitter with the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack, and a man named Grergory Selden has even filed a lawsuit against the company, arguing it violated the federal Civil Rights Act.
As Selden’s lawsuit winds its way to conclusion, Ronnia Cherry, Stefan Grant, and Rohan Gilkes have put together a Silicon Valley–style solution: short-term rental platforms created specifically for and by people of color, as a means to circumvent the racial discrimination that nonwhites, particularly black people, face on Airbnb. There’s just one small hiccup: Gilkes founded a website called noirebnb.com, while Cherry and Grant started one named noirbnb.com. As of yet, the site’s founders say they will not be joining forces.
Cherry, Grant, and Gilkes came up with the idea for an Airbnb for the POC community independently, each spurred on by encounters with racism while using the original service. For Cherry and Grant, it was having the police called after neighbors spotted them in an Airbnb rental in Georgia last October. (Cherry is a strategist, producer, and designer. Grant is an event coordinator and performer. The two were in Georgia working on a music festival.) “The cops thought we were robbing the place,” Grant said. “They showed up guns drawn. Luckily, we were able to deescalate the situation. We took a selfie and turned it into something positive.”
This May, Gilkes tried to book a room on Airbnb in Idaho for the Fourth of July. After his would-be host told him the dates were no longer available, he tried, and failed, to book the room for a different weekend. When Gilkes asked a white friend to book the same dates, “well, you can probably guess what happened … my friend was able to book the room,” he said. (Gilkes penned a Medium essay about the incident, which you can read here.)
Both Grant’s selfie and Gilkes’s essay quickly went viral, spurring responses from Airbnb. The company apologized to both parties, offering free stays to make up for what happened. Gilkes told me he declined the offer, and Cherry and Grant said they “knew that wasn’t going to solve the bigger issue.” (They were right, given that their bad experience predated Gilkes’s by about six months.)
Airbnb seems to have recognized the challenges it faces: It just announced a new diversity-hiring initiative (Airbnb’s staff is 63 percent white), in what seems like an attempt to undo some of the bad press the company has seen of late (including Selden’s lawsuit); the company also publicly banned two hosts this month for harassing black and transgender travelers. Meanwhile, a Harvard study found people with African-American–sounding names have a harder time booking on the platform.
Cherry and Grant started planning Noirbnb in early November 2015. When they reached out to Airbnb about their project, the company flew the pair to San Francisco to discuss it. “We gave them the full pitch for the site and told them our main goal was to make sure these situations never happened again,” Grant said. “We told them we foresaw more of these discrimination issues happening in the future. This was before #AirbnbWhileBlack happened.” Still, Cherry and Grant say Airbnb didn’t prioritize their proposal. “Airbnb thought these issues would go away, but instead they’ve just gotten bigger,” Cherry said. “We decided to do it on our own after we realized Airbnb wasn’t going to be directly tackling the issues.”
Both websites are currently accepting names, but aren’t operational yet. Cherry and Grant’s site went live last Friday and they already have numbers “in the thousands,” while Gilkes’s hit the web on Saturday and “over 23,000 people have already inquired.” (Airbnb declined to comment on either site.) “Prior to Friday, we had been holding the domain name and working on our backend,” Cherry explained. “When we announced [on Friday], another company with a similar name, Noirebnb, contacted us.”
The two sites have been in discussions since last Friday, but have not come to any agreement about joining forces. “Initially we were ready to merge together, but we’ve had to take some steps back as a business to make sure it makes sense for us,” Cherry said. “Merging is something that could happen, but if it doesn’t happen, we’re going to keep moving independently,” Gilkes said of his website. For Cherry and her team, moving past the name debacle can’t happen quickly enough. “It’s just been distracting from the main issue at hand, solving the racial discrimination problem,” she said.
A bigger problem might be money. Noirbnb is “still in the seed phase,” and Gilkes is currently bootstrapping his site, which he said should be operational in six to eight weeks. While all are optimistic, finding VC money can be difficult for founders of color. (A 2010 data study found that 87 percent of VC-backed founders are, not surprisingly, white.) Given that Airbnb’s business model operates in a bit of a legally gray area (most New York City residents who rent on the site are effectively breaking the law), capital is going to play a key role if either of these websites is to succeed. Disrupting the hotel industry and fighting housing laws costs some serious cash. (By comparison, Airbnb is valued at over $25 billion.) Creating businesses that cater to people of color is one way to counter the sharing economy’s race problem — but only if you can create those businesses in the first place.
But Gilkes, a tech entrepreneur by trade, says Airbnb’s response to his essay was “too little, too late.” “When I started getting all these emails from people — black people, trans people, gay people — who were all going through the same thing, I felt like I had an obligation to do something,” Gilkes told me. He started working on Noirebnb this spring.
And while each site will cater to people of color, they both plan to welcome all people looking for a safe and inclusive travel experience. (Neither party provided explicit ways they will enforce this inclusivity, but Cherry said Noirbnb is being designed to “educate and empower,” while Gilkes said Noirebnb will feature “strong discrimination policies.”)
A few weeks ago, a friend forwarded me an email thread between her co-workers. The subject: “Who Is Mallika Rao?”
I was actually trying to answer that question myself. And in the course of doing so I had signed up for LinkedIn, suddenly spamming random contacts of contacts — like said co-workers of my friend.
All of which is to say: Once you truly accept your smallness, you may find your first move is to sign up, humbly, with few expectations, to LinkedIn. Suddenly your place at the communal table looks nice, with all your practical brothers and sisters smiling kindly, saying, “We’ve been waiting.”
Joining the world’s largest professional network nearly a decade after I should have was an act of self-definition, or so I thought, a way to translate myself into terms which we’re all supposed to be fluent in. We’d missed each other, LinkedIn and I. It came of age just after I graduated college — a tool, I thought, for the corporate and buttoned-up. I resisted joining, even as I applied to my first, and second, writing jobs.
Rebellion played into this thinking, but so did ambition. Some part of me thought signing up might actually hurt my chances, by showing the seams of my efforts. Listing tiny wins and losses seemed against the writer’s task: to self-mythologize. My earliest idols mostly wrote by hand, before computers — or LinkedIn, or shilling your book on Snapchat — were things.
But one day, in the spring of 2016, I Googled a veteran writer I love. I wanted a story of hers I vaguely remembered. I found her LinkedIn account instead.
This can misfire. In less than an hour I had a text from a college friend. “Yo lady, I think your LinkedIn’s been hacked.” How did I know these co-workers of hers, she demanded, after emphasizing how hard it was to accept that this eerie account spamming everyone was actually me.
I don’t, I wrote. Had she ever emailed all of us? Maybe I’d messed up, and now everyone in my years-deep digital network was fielding my request to connect? (She said she didn’t know. It had been so long since she’d signed up.)
And so it was that several times a day I found myself tending to the new platform in my life: clarifying to strangers that I didn’t mean to imply that we are friends by asking to Link, rejecting suspect job offers, reassuring a former professor that I was fine, really, my career wasn’t dead. A man from whose website I’d bought a hat in 2015 wrote to thank me for connecting, before vowing to try to help me “in any way” he could.
Simply managing my account began to feel like the point. As I navigated my interactions, most of which hinged on the idea that my very existence on LinkedIn implied that I needed saving, I couldn’t help but admire the special brutality of the network. By spamming everyone I’d ever shared an email with, LinkedIn was calling attention to me in my moment of transition. Why wouldn’t this eager and obscure Mallika Rao — “Journalist at Various” — worry people, me included?
I can’t be alone in this task, explaining myself to people who think I need help. Last year, LinkedIn agreed to pay $13 million as a “sorry” for spamming friends of subscribers. Users track signs of the network’s grip over our lives. In a post that went viral, one blogger listed all the people LinkedIn should have known not to recommend to him: a woman with the same name as a forgotten ex-girlfriend; an aunt not even on LinkedIn who showed up with a shadow profile likely intended to dupe him into inviting her to join. (As of writing, requests for comment from LinkedIn were not returned.)
To a neurotic, sudden linkage to an infinite web of people can feel like shock therapy. LinkedIn manifests the self with a clarity no other platform is built to achieve. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are riggable: Make jokes, apply a filter, and your life seems on track. A 2016 Pew study shows low overlap between these “personality platforms” and LinkedIn, with its mania for life’s hard wins: degrees, titles. Its year-by-year log of failures and triumphs might show you to be good at what you do for a living, or maybe it’ll do the opposite: prove that you quit too early, change too often, have no one to recommend you. On LinkedIn, facts can feel like accusations.
Maybe this explains why I was reconnecting with people I’ve not heard from on any other platform — because, I’d guess, they stay away from those time-sucks. These are achievers — valedictorians, econ majors — applying equal rigor to the task of keeping up with their LinkedIn account. And why not? A person’s job history hides deeper truths, argued a recent article touting LinkedIn’s merits as a dating site. Loyalty, reliability, sociability — such traits make for LinkedIn gold.
Mine has been a good accident in a way, like showing up late to a class on limericks and having to sit through one on time-management instead. I’ve learned to come to peace with the vagueness of my life, by publicizing it so widely. My follower count now exceeds definition, at “500+.” This could mean anything. As early as day two, despite no clear action on my part, I hit 400, a milestone I remember because it coincided with a note from an unknown man with a bright smile, thanking me for “reaching out.” When I explained that I hadn’t meant to, he replied with mention of the class-action lawsuit against LinkedIn for this sort of thing. In his last line, he offered me a job.
A few months earlier, I’d left a staff-writing position to freelance full-time, an exercise in humility. Isolation can bring home the disposability of us all. Editors take their time replying, tweets about how stupid you are must be dealt with in solitude, and without co-workers it can be pretty easy to imagine vanishing one day and no one really noticing.
On Tuesday, Snapchat finally announced a few of the anticipated changes to its Discover feature, the part of the app where 19 publishers, including BuzzFeed, MTV, and Mashable share professionally produced, interactive stories, rather than the usual dog-filtered selfies your friends are snapping you.
Now, instead of having to swipe to the Discover page (a separate page in the Snapchat app where content from publishers lives independent from user-generated content), users will be able see stories from publishers in the feed, along with Live Stories (stories curated by Snapchat) and stories from friends they follow on the app.
While Live Stories and publisher content were previously visbile at the top of user’s feeds, starting today, they will look very different. Publishers’ stories will now include a picture and headline or caption to entice viewers to tap and watch. And if you’re a loyal follower of any one publisher, you’ll be able to subscribe to their stories, which will then also appear in your feed wedged in beneath stories from your real friends. (Not that media companies aren’t your real friends. They are.) To subscribe, press and hold on a story and tap the “subscribe” pop-up.
The idea is to create an environment where publishers feel more comfortable. Creating a Snapchat story requires more resources than a regular blog post, and is less versatile (you can’t upload it to Facebook, for example). Publishers will want to ensure they receive a return on their investment — whether in advertising money (of which Snapchat takes half) or just in metrics that look good in PowerPoint decks. Transforming Discover from logo symbols, which say nothing about what you get when you click, to old-fashioned headline-photo combos will certainly drive up numbers. Lists and other engagement-driving headlines and packages should, too.
Snapchat’s Discover page isn’t going anywhere, but it’s also getting a makeover. Previously, stories from publishers were hidden behind icons featuring their respective logos. (No offense to The Wall Street Journal, but its gray circle with “WSJ” written on it wasn’t doing them any traffic favors.) Now, stories on the Discover page will also feature images and headlines. (The new look, with its multi-sized vertical boxes, feels a little like news app Flipboard or Instagram’s discover page.)
Project Florence, created by Microsoft artist in residence Helene Steiner, uses electrical signals to transmit messages to your plants.
If today’s changes work to attract more publishers, they could potentially lure the real prize: big advertisers who’d rather work with reliable publishers than sloppy (and potentially controversial) user-generated content. But Snapchat still has to get people to watch. A heavy user of the app myself, I can count on one hand the number of publisher stories I’ve watched and remembered. (Actually, I can count on one finger. My younger sister made a cameo on a Cosmopolitan story once and my mother made me watch it and send her a screen shot.) The most engaging Snapchat stuff is compellingly amateurish, not slickly produced. The couple whose romance played out over Snapchat at the University of Wisconsin was cute, but when another couple did the exact same thing at Utah State a few weeks later, it felt forced and stiff. If you trust The Wall Street Journal and Vox to produce videos as compelling as the ones featuring your friends, the changes to Discover are great news, for you and for Snapchat’s long-term future.
Here is a remarkably stupid statement that is also true: A Facebook page created to distribute memes about garlic bread is now embroiled in controversy after posting a meme (about garlic bread) that some readers considered transphobic.
Anyway, last night, they posted this image:
Many vocal readers did not. The garlic-bread meme, in this case, was transphobic and discriminatory. Others found the outrage over a meme about garlic bread and gender funny in its ludicrousness. Then, Redditors found it, and swarmed the page to comment on political correctness and social-justice warriors.
Let me attempt to explain Garlic Bread Memes: Imagine popular memes, like Dat Boi, but with garlic bread added to them. That’s the page’s animating idea: What if your favorite memes referenced garlic bread? “This is very stupid,” you say, correctly. It’s amusing nonsense, with a quarter-million followers. Garlic Bread Memes is nothing if not committed to the bit.
Can you see why this might be a problem? Many people would argue that gender is not a binary, but rather a spectrum of options beside male and female. The page admin who posted the image is, according to BuzzFeed, an 18-year-old from Israel named Boaz, who said, “I posted it because I find it funny.”
Flame wars online — especially on Facebook — are nothing new. But they’ve usually been confined to political groups and pages that focus on issues into which people have invested an enormous amount of emotional energy, like parenting. No one is invested in garlic bread the way parents are invested in their breast-feeding choices. Garlic Bread Memes and Post Aesthetics are silly pages. I don’t mean that in a derogatory way, just in the sense that you wouldn’t expect them to erupt into extended flame wars.
Here’s another true statement: The Garlic Bread meme page is not even the first Facebook meme page this year to devolve into full-on flame wars following accusations of bigotry. A couple of weeks ago, the Facebook group Post Aesthetics — a private meme-sharing group — experienced a dramatic schism after members got into a heated debate over whether the frog Dat Boi was racist for appropriating black slang.
“I was distracted because in my 3rd period class … I have ASL [American Sign Language] and we were playing a game,” Black told me via Twitter DM. “We were playing a game, so when I started to scratch my leg with a pen I didn’t notice it was clicked. And then I happened to look down and saw my pants looked like a kid’s coloring book.” Several thousand people have retweeted the picture of Black’s leg from her Twitter account. (And several thousand more from the meme and parody accounts have since stolen it.)
As for why she was scratching her leg, Black blames itchy skin from a sunburn earlier in the spring. So I guess that’s two lessons: pen caps … and sunscreen.
Since it was revealed last month that Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel was funding lawsuits against Gawker Media — in particular a multimillion-dollar suit filed by the pro wrestler Hulk Hogan — details about his day-to-day involvement have been scant. Did Hogan know who was behind the suit? Had the two ever talked? As it turns out: Nope! According to Forbes, the idea that Thiel is a shadowy puppet master isn’t as hyperbolic as it sounds.
In addition to the Hogan case, and cases involving writer Ashley Terrill and purported email inventor Shiva Ayyadurai, Harder’s firm has also worked on cases involving Gawker’s unpaid interns, and a case brought by Meanith Huon, who leveled claims against Gawker Media blog Jezebel. Huon stated in open court that he was “getting support from Hulk Hogan’s lawyers in California.”
Forbes’s Ryan Mac and Matt Drange report that Thiel was never in direct contact with Charles Harder, the lawyer suing Gawker on behalf of Hogan and other clients. Someone cold-called Harder on Thiel’s behalf.
In addition to the legal complications, Forbes reports that “at least one Silicon Valley billionaire has quietly pursued the concept of a Gawker buyout by indirectly reaching out to former staffers.”
Trump supporters can’t catch a break. Hateful and intolerant Dumbocrats roam the streets in packs, seeking meek, pacificist conservatives to persecute arbitrarily. This is the America of 2016.
Take this harrowing instance, which the Twitter account @Cons_Nation tweeted last night:
Trump supporters were egged and punched at a San Jose protest last week. But this is not a photo of any of them. I don’t need to tell you that this image is fake. I mean, it’s a real picture of a person, but she’s an actor. It’s Samara Weaving, in horror-movie makeup, on the set of the Showtime series Ash vs Evil Dead. Bonus: You can even see part of the Daily Mail image credit in the lower-left corner.
Thank you, heroes, for speaking up.
This is the second widely circulated hoax image concerning imaginary beatings of Trump supporters this week: Another widespread image supposedly of a badly beaten Trump-supporting Latino teenager was actually taken from a telenovela.
Still, nothing animates the right-wing internet like fake stories of fellow conservatives getting horrendously beaten by Democrats. Other Twitter users were brave enough to share their own stories of intolerant liberals.
But it’s also that on the internet, where participants are constantly compelled to outwardly perform their identities, there’s no distinction between the silly and the serious, the personal and the political. Everything is a staging ground for debate, even meme pages.
To some extent, this is a case of what’s known as the filter bubble — the assumption that our highly customized and personalized social-media feeds are accurate reflections of the world at large. It’s understandable that anyone willing to subscribe to the pinpoint specificity of garlic-bread memes might also assume that fellow followers are like-minded. But homogeny doesn’t scale. Once you have a group in the thousands, you will come across people with whom you disagree.
The heist at the center of Now You See Me 2 — where magicians execute capers via tricks and illusions — involves what is referred to as “The Stick.” It’s a device that is said to be able to de-encrypt any computer, any network, no matter the security level, and of course it’s coveted by a certain class of thieves.
If you were hoping for Apple to announce exciting, game-changing news at this year’s developer conference, you might want to lower your expectations. By most accounts, the coming changes are said to be incremental, mostly software- and services-related. Fast Company’s roundup hits on most of the anticipated reveals: the next version of iOS, Siri finally coming to Mac, maybe something like an Amazon Echo.
Apple is spending a lot of the lead-up to WWDC attempting to quell those fears and, to that end, they’re introducing two major changes to the app store that will hopefully open the door to more revenue for developers (and, obviously, themselves).
In fairness, the Worldwide Developer Conference is just that: a developer conference, meaning that while there is a lot of peacocking, the show is meant for the people making technology products, not the people consuming them. A growing anxiety in the app-development industry is that the heady early days of lucrative apps are over. As Recode today put it bluntly, “The app boom is over.” Even top app publishers are seeing downloads decrease, and while smartphone adoption is growing, the market’s growth curve has not kept pace. In other words, app development — once seen as a field that allows two guys in a garage to compete against larger tech companies — has become lucrative for only a select few. There isn’t really a middle class in app development. Devs either blast off like a rocket, or sink to the bottom.
The first new feature is that search ads are on their way. As on Google or Twitter, publishers can pay to have their app appear in results for relevant keywords. This isn’t a new feature for most search engines, but discoverability in Apple’s store is notably terrible. It can seem like if you’re not on the charts or in the first five results for any term, you’re likely to get buried. Search ads allow developers s better chance to get their work in front of prospective buyers — for a fee.
The bigger change, though, is that Apple is tweaking its subscription model — opening it up to a wider selection of businesses. Until now, only certain apps, such as media outlets and streaming services, were allowed to charge subscriptions through Apple. Soon, any app will be able to do so.
Even more importantly for developers, Apple is tweaking the cut that it takes from these subscriptions. Until now, the company has sliced off a fat 30 percent from all transactions that flow through it. With the new changes, subscriptions that last more than a year will see Apple lowering their take to 15 percent. In other words, if app publishers can keep subscribers on the hook for a year, they’ll start earning a large portion of the proceeds.
It’s tough to predict how these subscription changes will play out, but the move is clearly meant to try and prevent developers from circumventing the app-store ecosystem. Amazon famously removed the ability to buy Kindle books through its iOS app, rather than give Apple a 30 percent cut of every transaction. Alternatively, music streaming services like Tidal and Spotify charge an extra $3 a month on iOS to make up for Apple’s skimming.
Of course: Whether or not people want to subscribe to more apps is unclear. What helps is that subscribing through Apple is an extremely easy process — subscribing to an app is about as easy as buying more lives in Candy Crush. If Apple can make starting a subscription easier, and bring developers onboard, they’ll likely see gains. And if developers can keep people on the hook for more than a year, they’ll see greater, and recurring, revenue. It’s not difficult to imagine free-to-play games like Clash of Clans offering subscription fees in lieu of micro-transactions.
Apple still has no plans to offer frequently requested features like free trials or paid software upgrades. These are steps in the right direction for Apple to repair some of its relations with developers, but they’re also small steps.
It has been over a year since the great llama chase of 2015 stopped any and all work from happening on the internet and provided humanity with pure entertainment for a solid 18 minutes.
The bear was first seen at 10:30 this morning, KTLA reports, and has been on the move ever since. While there isn’t a continuous livestream, KTLA has been doing an excellent job of keeping people entertained, I mean, keeping people informed, on its Twitter account. Here’s the bear taking a dip in someone’s pool. (You can watch an aerial video of the swim here.)
But now, a bear wandering the city of La Cañada Flintridge, near Los Angeles, California, seems poised to become the web’s newest rogue-animal phenom.
More recently, the bear was spotted in a tree.
As of publishing time, it appears the ursine runaway is still at large, but authorities are attempting to lure the animal back to safety and away from any unsuspecting swimming pools. We will be updating as more information becomes available.
“The first film was about stealing from bank accounts, and this film is more about stealing information,” star Mark Ruffalo told Select All at the film’s premiere, on Monday. “This is just a mass gathering of information, and people planning to use it for personal gain.”
Given the subject matter, it’s no wonder that the film’s stars (and magic consultants) became a little paranoid about their own personal information. “I can show you on your phone where they keep all the metadata, if you want,” offered Daniel Radcliffe. “What I realized is that deleting all that data doesn’t matter, though, because they’ll store it somewhere else. We’re in one of those moments in society where technology has outpaced the legislation.”
Still, the actors take precautions. Ruffalo has had his email account hacked into several times (“and it really messed me up”), so he moved from Mac to Gmail. He’s a fan of two-step verification, as is Lizzy Caplan. But she goes even further. Beyond changing her password constantly and hiring professional internet-security help, she also avoids having an online presence — no social-media accounts, and no auto-pay. “I don’t think anybody should trust that, or anything like that, with credit cards,” she said. “I am so paranoid about my online security, more than anybody I know. I live in fear, like a grandmother!”
“I am so paranoid about my online security, more than anybody I know. I live in fear, like a grandmother!” David Copperfield, a producer on the film, marveled at how it’s actually safer to use practices from an earlier era. “You can’t get hacked if you revert to passing handwritten notes!” he said, and laughed.
It may look like a colorful plastic credit card, but in reality, it’s so much more.

Apps like this have existed before, but this is the first time anyone has done it as a wearable.
Update: This post originally stated that publisher content lived exclusively on Snapchat’s Discover section before the app update. It was also previously visible at the top of users’ feeds and we have updated the post to reflect this.
Check out this tweet from the president of the United States of America, Barack Obama, regarding the political squabble surrounding Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.
But you weren’t thinking about that. I know you weren’t. You were thinking about that big honkin’ 69 staring at you. That’s the sex number, you thought to yourself.
“Nice,” you whispered to nobody in particular.
The 69 (verb: 69-ing) is a sex move, as we all know because we are sophisticated, sex-having adults. But 69, being a two-digit number unavoidable when counting from 68 to 70, also appears in other contexts. Like the president’s tweet.
Filling a Supreme Court vacancy is an extremely important process, the results of which could have significant repercussions for vast swaths of the American citizenry.
In a sexual context, “nice” has been around for a long time. We crawled out of the primordial ooze and figured out how to simultaneously stimulate each others’ genitals with our mouths, and then shortly thereafter we figured out how to react to news of the 69: “Nice.” Simple, elegant, to the point.
You might have seen it on South Park:
The sex number is, among a large subset of social-media users, an incredibly important number (as is the weed number, 420). When you see the sex number, which is 69, it is your duty to comment “nice.”
Let’s check in on the response to that Obama tweet.
The thing about the internet is that everyone on it is horny. Everyone on the internet is horny all the time. Selfies are thirst traps; faves and likes are one-click methods of saying, “I’m thirsty.” This is not that different from the real world, where, thanks to the magic of biology, everyone is in a perpetual state of “horned up and ready to go.” But on the internet, sex manifests itself in unexpected ways. Like how there is somehow now only one correct response to the number 69.
Or The Office:
Great work, everybody.
Adding your “nice” to the Jenga tower of “nices” is one of the great small kindnesses of our age. The 69 is a clarion call, to which users answer, “I see the 69, and I’m aware of its significance and our traditions.”
Impromptu collaboration on the web is always an intensely satisfying moment, and accumulating a large stack of “nice” is great — even more so when it happens in traditionally combative forums like the area beneath a presidential tweet. The 69 is bipartisan. Red states and blue states have both voted “nice” on Proposition 69. Make America 69 Again. There are many responses to Obama’s tweet that are not “nice,” but that’s to be expected. There are still many people saying “nice,” and that’s … nice.
Have you ever played the Game? Maybe you have, but if not, the Game is played like this: You cannot think about the Game. If you remember the Game, you lose. The number 69 is similar, in that you don’t have to actively seek out 69s, but when you see them, you must act. You have to say “nice.” That is shorthand for “You and I? We both know about sex. Congratulations to us on our base-level sexual knowledge.” If you see a 69 and don’t comment “nice,” that just means you don’t know about an extremely cool activity (which is, to be clear, having sex).
Weed fans celebrate weed on April 20, which can also be written as 420. So, too, do sex-havers have a calendar date of their own. It’s today, June 9, abbreviated as 6/9. Remove the slash. Do you see it? It’s the number 69. The clock will never read 6:9, but I think celebrating at 6:09 is perfectly acceptable.
In conclusion: 69. Please leave your thoughts in the comments.
Parenting sounds fun. You invest years of time and energy into raising a kid, pouring not just your money but your body and soul into ensuring his safety, happiness, and future, just to have him repay you by repeatedly shooting you with a Nerf gun, while filming your reaction so the internet can collectively laugh at your displeasure with being, you know, repeatedly shot with a Nerf gun.
A video making the rounds on Reddit’s /r/videos perfectly captures these intimate father-son moments. The video only had a few thousand views as of last night, but has already spiked to over 200,00 and counting. We have a feeling this might be 2016’s version of that kid who threw eggs at his unsuspecting mom for a year. (You know the one. “Noooooo!”)
Sometimes you find yourself confronting questions about your gadgets that are so basic you don’t want to consult your IT guy, your manual, or your niece. That’s why we’re here. This week, in basic answers to basic questions: how to free up space on your iPhone.
There’s no magic way to free up your phone’s storage entirely. But there are all kinds of tweaks and tricks you can try to buy yourself a little breathing room, starting with buying the right phone.
We can keep this short: Don’t get a 16GB iPhone. Just don’t. It’s not enough room. Even if 16GB sounds like it might be enough, remember that at least 5GB of that is already spoken for by iOS and all the preloaded, non-trashable apps that come with it.
Don’t do it. Especially when for $100 more you get four times the storage. That’s going to be the right fit for most people. If you shoot a lot of video or download graphics-heavy games or just don’t want to deal, you can step up to the 128GB model, but otherwise it’ll be overkill.
The iPhone has a great camera, but it’s also a grade-A space hog. The nuclear option: Triple-check that your photo library is fully backed up on the cloud of your choice (iCloud, Dropbox, Google Photos, but really honestly just Google Photos), and/or a hard drive, and delete them all. Easy! I know it feels weird, but you were going to have to do it when you got a new phone anyway. Might as well cleanse in stages.
For those who favor a little more finesse, there are a few settings you can tweak that will minimize your gigabyte consumption along the way.
First up: If you have HDR on, which you might as well, your iPhone is storing two versions of every photo you take. One is HDRified (a few shots taken at different exposures at the same time, combined to make one super-picture); the other is the original. Wasteful! In Settings, go to Photos & Camera, then Keep Normal Photo, and unselect.
Next, if you’re not using Live Photos (or if you don’t know what Live Photos are), turn them off. With the camera app open, look for the icon with three concentric circles at the top of the screen. If it’s yellow, tap it. All of a sudden, you’re not taking mini videos every time you just wanted a still life.
And finally, speaking of videos, do you watch yours anywhere other than on your phone? If the answer is no, you should take the quality down a notch. Go back to that Photos & Camera setting and tap Record Video. The default is 1080p at 30 fps. You want 720p at 30 fps. It takes up less than half the space, and you won’t notice the difference on a smaller screen. Honestly, it’ll look acceptable on a TV, too, if it ever comes to that.
Photos are usually the prime offender, but there are lots of sneaky apps that bloat your phone in the background. Fortunately, it’s easy to see what’s doing the most damage.
Open your settings app, and head to General, then Storage & iCloud Usage, and finally Manage Storage. Behold! A complete breakdown of what apps are taking up what kind of room. Photos & Camera will be at the top for most people, but you’ll probably also find a podcast app (if you listen to podcasts), a game or three, and a video you may have downloaded because, dammit, it’s not streaming anywhere.
One app that might surprise you? Messages. (Or GroupMe, or whatever you use for chat.) Those pics you sent are sitting in your iMessage history, your Photos app, and whatever your cloud backup of choice is, because you have one of those, because you have no interest in being one toilet-drop away from losing precious memories. That’s triple-redundant! Delete, delete, delete.
I mentioned the cloud before, but here’s the thing: You really need to use it as much as possible. You know how you have all kinds of shit in your house that you only occasionally use, and the rest of the time it just takes up space? Imagine if you could make it all disappear, have it show up when you need it, and then poof again when you’re done. That’s the cloud.
Have a big music collection? Stream it. At most, keep one workout playlist on your phone, since you generally don’t have Wi-Fi when you run, and having “212” cut out on mile three can be a real momentum-killer.
Have a ton of photos? Keep tiny, low-resolution versions on your phone (head to Settings, then iCloud, then Photos, then Optimize iPhone Storage) and keep a better copy in the cloud. It doesn’t even have to be iCloud! Dropbox has nice cross-platform sharing features. Amazon is cheap as hell, and free for photos if you’re a Prime member. But, again, just use Google Photos.
Haven’t updated in awhile? Get iOS 9. Last fall, Apple added a feature called “app thinning” that lets developers only send you little pieces of their apps at a time, and only when you need them. So if you buy, say, a ten-level game, maybe only the first two actually live on your phone until you finally, I dunno, mace your way out of that orc dungeon? Whatever you’re into. Not all apps do this, but if you’re on iOS 8 or earlier, none of them will.
I know, I know. But it is a trick, and it really is weird, and it’s honestly the only one of its kind.
Here’s how it works. If you’re running low on storage, go into iTunes and find a movie that takes up more space than you have available (you can find out exactly where you’re at by going to Settings, then General, then About). Might I recommend Avatar? Don’t worry, you won’t actually have to rent it. But at 7.2GB, it can almost fill up a 16GB iPhone by itself.
Why and how this works doesn’t really matter (also, no one knows for sure), but it’s probably just iOS cleaning out some digital detritus to make room for your big purchase. The important thing is that it works, and that you’ve bought yourself a little more time.
Tap “Rent” twice. Your iPhone will dutifully tell you that, sorry, it doesn’t have enough room for Sam Worthington and his giant feline Smurf cosplay. Damn.
Now go back and check your storage again. There’s more! Magic. You can repeat this process until your storage stops going up, or until you have enough that you could actually rent Avatar.
Dastardly. The Mobile Device Marauder then allegedly grabbed the iPhones from a drawer and handed them to an accomplice in the showroom. The accomplice then put them under his shirt (shirts: clearly important for this heist) and walked out.
As DNAinfo reports:
The phones, valued at $16,130, have not yet been recovered.
While Apple’s Cupertino campus is a notoriously secretive facility with Fort Knox–like security measures, the company’s thousands of Apple stores around the globe are less so.
A recent example: Some guy stole 19 iPhones by just wearing a certain shirt and walking into the back room.
The best Twitter is when everyone on Twitter unites and points their 140-character-typing fingers at something together. Something sad, something funny, something gross. Doesn’t matter: Twitter is built on collective, rolling commentary. But Twitter is so large — and so easy to use — that as you crank out fire tweets and memes about presidential candidates, world events, and the Kardashian family at large, you’re more likely than ever to come across someone (or more than one someone) who’s already made the joke you are planning to make, creating a blurry line between stolen content and minds that truly just happened to think alike.
My friends Caroline Moss of CNBC and Melissa Radzimski of the Huffington Post gave it a name. They called it “tweet-saming.” (Pronounced like “tweet-shaming,” but without the “h.”)
The same thing happens in real life all the time — two or more people come up with the same joke. It’s just that until the advent of Twitter, we didn’t have real-time access to the most basic thoughts, feelings, and punch lines of hundreds of millions of other human beings. Your one-on-one conversations now include the entire world, and jokes that would have had an audience of “everyone in the room” now have a potential audience of “every person on Twitter.” Add to this the fact that tweeting requires no effort, and that there’s no social punishment for a failed joke the way there might be in person, and you’ve found a perfect environment for millions of people to try out the first joke that comes to their minds — which often happens to be the same one.
About a year ago, a few of my friends and then-colleagues were discussing the phenomenon after the New York Stock Exchange went down and people started flooding Twitter with variants on the the same joke: “Glitch better have my money,” a groan-inducing pun on Rihanna’s “Bitch Better Have My Money.” When a joke that bad becomes ubiquitous across Twitter, it seems unlikely that mass joke-theft was the culprit: Instead, a whole bunch of people came up with the joke at roughly the same time and sent their tweets out into the world.
Just this week, after Hillary Clinton clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, Democratic strategist and writer Laura Olin tweeted this celebratory meme, depicting every president in history using only emoji. The string of 43 old-white-man emoji juxtaposed next to just one man of color and one woman quickly went viral, with over 5,000 retweets.
If you Google “everyone on Twitter made the same joke,” you’ll see plenty of tweet roundups of people making wholly unoriginal comments. Singer Lesley Gore died and the Twitter collective replied with an endless stream of “it’s my party and I’ll die if I want to” jokes. Hodor, um, well, something happened to Hodor on Game of Thrones a few weeks back and everyone and their computer-savvy mother tweeted pictures of the character taped over their offices’ elevator buttons. The Czech Republic contemplated a name change to the tune of a zillion “Czechia-self before you wrechia-self” tweets. The list goes on and on.
But as Olin’s tweet spread, similar emoji-laden tweets started cropping up from people claiming the joke as their own. As Caitlin Dewey noted at the Washington Post, some of these tweets likely were copycats, but Olin later tweeted that she thought “there were a few alt versions of this that weren’t stolen (like @JuddLegum’s) but legit minds-thinking-alike-ing.” Read: Olin and Legum tweet-samed.
Tweet-saming is like a small-scale cyber version of simultaneous invention, the idea that things can be discovered and invented (or in this case, tweets can be tweeted) by independent people at approximately the same time. The case of Elisha Grey and Alexander Graham Bell, two men who both filed patents for the telephone, is an oft-cited example. (Bell filed first, by about a day, and was ultimately awarded the patent and the honor of becoming the father of the modern-day phone.)
So tweet fast, tweet originally, and maybe get yourself a friend, a rabbi, or a justice of the peace to bear witness and lend credibility to your particularly fire tweets. But whatever you do, please, please, don’t knowingly steal someone’s joke and claim it as your own. We live in a post “CTRL-F” economy, and if you are caught you fully deserve to be tweet-shamed. The one with the “h.”
As with Bell and Grey, but on a much, much more prosaic scale, Twitter jokes often come down to timing. If you get your joke out there first, you get, for better or worse, to claim yourself as its owner. (This spring, when Instagram changed its logo, I tweeted a joke likening the new look to a Microsoft PowerPoint slide and my mentions and comments included numerous people saying they had thought or said the exact the same thing. They just hadn’t tweeted it.) By this logic, the second, and fifth, and 23rd person to tweet a joke becomes the Twitter equivalent of that dude who almost invented the telephone: Smart, but not the guy history remembers. When the history of Twitter is, uh, written.
At a certain point, finding space on your iPhone feels like looking for linoleum in a hoarder’s kitchen. And even if you do dig out enough room for another photo or two, you’re only an app update away from being overstuffed again. It’s no way to live. So don’t.
Today, the presidential race has truly begun:
Dat Boi — The frog-on-a-unicycle meme would make an excellent tweet for an arrival to a major event, like the Democratic National Convention this summer. This should give Clinton’s social team plenty of time to Photoshop her head onto a frog. “Oh shit waddup!!”
That’s a tweet from presumptive Democratic presidential nominee to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, instructing Trump to — in the direct and oft-quoted manner of teenagers on Twitter — delete his account. (“Delete your account” is an ancient Twitter burn whose origins are lost in the mists of time.)
But now that Hillary has demonstrated her mastery of entry-level Twitter memes, she’s going to need some more material. Some suggestions:
Primitive Sponge — The newest meme of summer 2016, Primitive Sponge is perfect for those moments when you find yourself shocked, enraged, and generally alert. How about “mrw someone questions my fitness for office.”
“Fuck Me Daddy” — Self-explanatory.
The Cucumber Tweet — Hmm. Actually, don’t do this one.
“Don’t Talk to Me or My Son Ever Again” — A little tough because Hillary doesn’t have a son. But she does have a daughter, Chelsea, so this still works. It’s 2016 and memes don’t have to conform to gender constraints! Everything is a spectrum!
Yesterday, Jerry Seinfeld participated in another Reddit AMA, fielding questions from one of the largest internet communities about comedy and jokes and bees.
In 2007, Seinfeld scripted and starred as the lead in Bee Movie, a film in which Barry B. Benson sues the human race for exploiting bees, and enters into a romantic relationship with a human female. This was a kid’s film.
On Reddit yesterday, Seinfeld was asked if we’ll ever see a Bee Movie 2. We gotta know what happened to Barry! But Seinfeld declined.
Thank you, Jerry, for standing up for this “iconic” film and defending true art. The show was about nothing, but Bee Movie is about everything.
On weirder corners of the internet, like Tumblr, it’s attained a cult following. People love Bee Movie so much that they’ll send one another the entire script.
The joke landed squarely with its target audience, and immediately sent people on Twitter into a fever dream of “slay,” “burn,” “same,” and “YASS KWEEN!” It is now her most retweeted tweet ever, usurping the title from a previous missive about One Direction. Mic published an article about the tweet entitled “In Three Glorious Words, Hillary Just Shut Down Trump on Twitter Once and for All.” CNBC explained it on air:
How often do you use a period? You know, the small dot at the end of a sentence. The one that says, “Statement ends here.” If you’re prone to communicate over digital mediums like social media, IM, or text, you probably don’t use it all that often.
In fact, scientists last winter determined that ending texts with a period could be more alienating. In the study, according to the Washington Post, “experimental messages featured an invitation followed by a brief reply. When that reply was followed by a period, subjects rated the response as less sincere than when no punctuation was used. The effect wasn’t present in handwritten notes.”
The period has become a small form of aggression, redundant in an age of speech bubbles and line breaks. We don’t really need it anymore when instead of collecting multiple thoughts on one page, every statement we make is a discrete chunk of data. The same goes for status updates on social media. The informal nature is one thing, but, in addition, there are tons of visual boundaries and cues separating thoughts and statements from each other.
According to language expert David Crystal, as quoted by the New York Times, “We are at a momentous moment in the history of the full stop.” Digital communication has mostly done away with the period. Texting bubbles, for instance, perform the same function that periods once did, forming boundaries around individual statements.
Obviously, the period isn’t going to disappear from, like, books and stuff — this shift applies more to informal written communication than it does to capital-W Writing. Still, it all has the consequence of making the period less relevant and more menacing. The period isn’t just an end point anymore, it’s a signal.
Google search histories are sacred spaces, a record of every stupid question you’ve asked the internet. (“Why isn’t Chicago the capitol of Illinois?” “Where can I buy Hamilton tickets for less than $1 million?” “Why are my toenails falling off?”)
That is, unless, you click this link and let RuinMySearchHistory.com absolutely demolish your digital footprint. (Warning: You should probably only click that link in incognito mode.) Once you run the program, it automatically Googles charming phrases like “rohypnol safe dosage,” “ways to kill someone hypothetically,” “penis remove dog how to,” and “ISIS application form.” While opening the link in an incognito window won’t necessarily hide your searches from your internet-service provider, it will spare you from seeing targeted ads based on those searches. Which is probably for the best.
The site is currently being discussed on Reddit’s /r/InternetIsBeautiful, where, despite several, blatant, NSFW warnings, some people are upset they clicked the link and, well, ruined their search history. “As an middle eastern student living in Germany, I lost my shit when that happened and started screaming no, no, no,” writes one Redditor. In a complete 180 from the usual rules of the net, in this instance it paid to actually read the comments. “Jesus guys. I’m in an airport right now. Glad I read the comments before I clicked anything,” wrote another Redditor.
The OP (Reddit-speak for “Original Poster,” a.k.a. the person who made the website) later commented on the thread apologizing. “OP here. I made this. Sorry to everyone who ends up in Guantanamo off this. But imagine how many times I ran this when testing it. See you there?”
See you there.
Just weeks after Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel was discovered to be secretly funding several lawsuits against the company in a decade-long quest to destroy it, Gawker Media has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections in preparation for a sale.
Founder Nick Denton broke the news to staff in an all-hands meeting today. (Disclosure: I worked for Gawker for six years, and left last summer.) The bankruptcy filing won’t affect day-to-day operations, but it will allow Gawker to restructure and continue operating as it considers bids. The company apparently already has a firm offer from PC Magazine publisher Ziff Davis for less than $100 million, though it expects to receive higher bids over the next few months.
Practically, the restructuring makes the prospect of buying Gawker more attractive. In April, a Florida jury levied a $140 million verdict against Gawker, Denton, and former editor-in-chief A.J. Daulerio in a 2012 lawsuit filed by Hulk Hogan over a portion of a sex tape featuring the professional wrestler published by the site. While Gawker insists (with good reason) that it will win on appeal, the company would have been obligated to post a portion of the enormous damages throughout the appeals process.
But while the Hogan lawsuit is the most direct liability, the late revelation that Thiel, with his practically limitless funds, had set out to destroy the company narrowed Denton’s options further. Even were Gawker to wait out and win the appeal in the Hogan suit, Thiel could continue funding lawsuits against Gawker Media as long as he wanted. One way of stopping those lawsuits, if Shah’s memo is anything to go by, is to give Thiel what he wants and shutter Gawker.com.

If Ziff Davis bought Gawker Media, though, it would likely look very different. In a memo from CEO Vivek Shah obtained by Recode, the flagship site is left conspicuously unmentioned:
Thomas Perkins, the influential Silicon Valley investor, died last week, at the age of 84. It’s hard to think of anyone on the investment side of the tech industry who looms as large as Perkins, a notorious character who might be best known outside of the Bay Area for launching the world’s largest (privately owned) sailing yacht, the Maltese Falcon, in 2006. As well as being a pioneer in tech investing — providing funding to companies that would soon become some of the most influential in the world — Perkins also pioneered another Valley trait: squandering that goodwill by casting himself as the aggrieved and persecuted.
Cleaning grills is the last thing anyone looks forward to. As a result, many of us just sort of leave all of that garbage on the grill for a dangerously long time. So, maybe someone could interest you in this robot?
Father’s Day is coming up, after all.
It’s been a bang-up couple of months for hackers. Tumblr, MySpace, Twitter, Linkedin, Katy Perry, Mark Zuckerberg, the NFL, and North Korea’s Facebook clone are just a few of the victims who have been digitally compromised of late. And now, you can add activist and politician DeRay McKesson to the ever-growing list. McKesson’s phone, Twitter, and email were breached on Friday, McKesson explained on Twitter after regaining access to his account.
To impersonate McKesson, the hacker, who made themself known on Twitter with several pro-Trump tweets from McKesson’s account, needed only the last four digits of his Social Security number. With that information (which, granted, would could be tricky to find, but not that tricky for someone hell-bent on hacking), the hacker was able to convince Verizon to switch the SIM (a smart card inside your phone that stores your data and essentially makes your phone your phone) connected to the account from the one in McKesson’s phone to one in their own. From there, all notifications and texts from Verizon went to the hacker’s phone, instead of McKesson, because his account had effectively been removed from his physical device. This style of hacking is a practice known as “social engineering,” where a person manipulates someone else into giving them access by a series of nuanced steps. (In this case, the hacker posing as McKesson got Verizon to change the SIM, and then used that switch to change McKesson’s passwords, and then used those passwords to hack his email accounts and Twitter. You get the idea.)
There are several of ways to protect yourself from getting hacked (not using the same passwords across multiple platforms is a good way to start, cough cough, Mark Zuckerberg). Another is turning on two-step verification for accounts, which requires you to log in via password, and then sends a one-time-use code to your cell phone you have to input to complete the process. In theory, only you would have both the password and the phone with the code, making it much more difficult for someone else to access your account or device. What is most alarming about McKesson’s hack is that he was using two-factor verification, but the hacker’s phone-call workaround rendered it useless.
Since then, McKesson says that Twitter has helped him get his account access back and deleted tweets from the hacker. Verizon, which has a recording of the phone call with the hacker (“this call may be recorded for quality assurance”) is looking into the situation. Select All reached out to the company for more information on the situation and to see if Verizon had recommendations for customers looking to avoid a similar ordeal. “Verizon takes the security and privacy of our customers very seriously. We are aware of Mr. McKesson’s claims and Verizon security teams are investigating,” a representative said.
For now, remember to keep your passwords private and complex. Keep a tight leash on your Social Security number and a close watch on your personal accounts. And please, please, for the love of Steve Jobs stop using “password” as a password. Yes, I’m looking at you.
News broke earlier today that Gawker Media had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a move intended to protect the company’s assets and restructure it before it’s acquired by … someone. Since its founding in 2003, Gawker’s made a point of boasting about its independence; within a few months, it may no longer be able to. But who’s going to buy it?
“All these people seem terrible on Facebook, but in person they’re sort of nice,” a member of the Harvard class of 2006 said, surveying her classmates who had come back to Cambridge for their tenth reunion. It was noon on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, and the alums were gathered for a barbecue in Harvard Yard, having just watched several TED Talks given by a predictably successful group of their peers. Ruth Schlitz spoke about her work developing a smart window that can be tinted automatically, while Rebecca O’Brien detailed an investigative series on heroin use in New Jersey that made her a Pulitzer Prize finalist. Susanna Brock, a math teacher at Berkeley Carroll, the Harvard of Brooklyn’s K-12 institutions, had been conducting an experiment on whether single-sex math classes might improve the performance of female students. (Early results are promising.)
Of course, this is Harvard, so there are a few candidates. If we exclude Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo, 45, who spent nearly a decade taking classes between tours before graduating in 2006, the class’s first celebrity was Nick McDonell, who wrote his debut novel in high school, to considerable acclaim, and published his second while at Harvard. (That occasion was marked in this magazine with a profile titled “Don’t Hate Him Because He’s Young, Good-Looking, Privileged, Impeccably Connected, and About to Publish His Second Novel.”) He recently published his seventh book, having spent much of his postgraduation life reporting from Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Several people pointed to Elise Stefanik, who announced her candidacy for a congressional seat in upstate New York, which she won, by posting a photo on Instagram, which Zuckerberg owns. (Stefanik could not attend the reunion owing to Memorial Day commitments in her vet-heavy district.) Others said that they had recently been served ads on Facebook featuring their classmate Alexa von Tobel, who has become a prominent personal-finance guru.
Among the many industries that Facebook has disrupted is the in-person reunion, but nearly half of the class had decided to show up for a real-life status update, despite a warning from the university about a mumps epidemic. (“What could be more quintessentially Harvardian than a 19th-century disease that isn’t transmitted sexually?” one ’06er said.) The organizers had tried to stress that the digital age only made reunions all the more meaningful. “Perhaps we share more honestly with no pressure to garner ‘likes,’” wrote the class secretary in her introduction to the Red Book, a bound class directory published at each reunion, with updates written by the graduates themselves. Some choose to abstain, but others go on for pages, or compose entries to the tune of “I Dreamed a Dream” from Les Misérables: “I dream of Harvard years gone by / With precious friends, each day a story.” Quitting Facebook was mentioned as an important life update, as were marriage, infertility, battles with depression, and, most commonly, the acquisition of a dog. Several people brought up the class’s most prominent member. “The Class of 2006 is full of competitive type-A overachievers that, unfortunately for me (and quite frankly for you too), includes Mark Zuckerberg, who I think we can all agree has probably won this round,” wrote one alum. He then described his “deadbeat life,” which included earning a Ph.D. and working for the National Institutes of Health.
Well, one of them started it. Kirkland House was the Harvard dormitory where, in the fall of 2003, Mark Zuckerberg began work on Thefacebook.com. Zuckerberg came to Cambridge as a member of the class of 2006 and had he not joined Bill Gates, Matt Damon, and Pete Seeger as Harvard dropouts, he might have been just another one of his overachieving classmates who had come to the reunion to update everyone on his latest promotion. Instead, he had made more money than all 1,650 of them combined. “I told my sister that I was doing this TED Talk today,” O’Brien, the Pulitzer finalist, said. “And she was like, ‘So what’s the TED Talk for? People who aren’t Mark Zuckerberg but did okay?’”
Michael Beal, who had started a hedge fund, devoted his presentation to talking about the digital revolution that his company was utilizing to make trades and that, he suggested, had been launched in part by the class of 2006. “We showed the world that virality could really add value,” Beal said. “We started this as Harvard students, with a desire to take it from Kirkland House to the world.”
“I had no idea he was gonna fucking build Facebook,” Bede Moore, one of Zuckerberg’s freshman-year roommates, told me a few hundred yards from where they had lived in Straus Hall. “But it was very clear to us already that we were living with somebody very brilliant.” Most everyone who knew Zuckerberg at Harvard rejects the heartless version presented in The Social Network, and Moore, an Australian who came to Harvard as a rower, remembered him as a kind, friendly, and generous roommate. “I mean, let’s also not kid ourselves,” Moore said. “He was super-nerdy.” A freshman-year photo of Zuckerberg, Moore, and their other two roommates shows Moore beaming with his head above theirs while Zuckerberg looks shyly down at the ground.
Thefacebook.com went live on February 2004. (“The big thing was poking,” several people told me at reunion, referencing an early feature unfamiliar to most of the more than a billion and a half people who have since joined the site.) By semester’s end, Facebook had more than a hundred-thousand users and Zuckerberg left for California, but the site’s growth was still manageable enough that Chris Hughes, one of Zuckerberg’s sophomore-year roommates, was able to perform his duties as Facebook’s spokesman while studying abroad in Paris. It wasn’t especially odd for a Harvard undergraduate to take time off to work on an extracurricular project, and many people assumed Zuckerberg would return to Cambridge after a semester or two. But by graduation, there was still no sign of him, and Facebook had a valuation of $750 million, which turned out to be a rather pessimistic projection. “There’s a bunch of people from our class doing really brilliant things — they just don’t happen to be the most successful person of our entire generation,” Moore said. “There’s competition for them, where for Mark, there is no rival. It’s like a joke with people in our class: ‘Who’s coming in second?’”
The official hashtag for the weekend was “#legendary06,” and a wide range of skills were on display at both the TED Talks and a talent show held after the barbecue, during which one person performed Kesha’s “Tik Tok” in sign language, another sang “a short song about misery,” while a third read from a novel he had written about finding millions of dollars under a bathroom sink. No one had eradicated mumps, but the class included a doctor on a Native American reservation, writers for Game of Thrones and Parks and Recreation, a section violinist in the Baltimore Chamber Orchestra, and the COO of the Harlem Children’s Zone. Other notable figures were sure to emerge: The buzz at the 35th reunion was that newly minted attorney general Loretta Lynch was going to show up.
Some people tried tech, but for perhaps the first time in history, Harvard graduates found an industry that was relatively unimpressed by their degree. Google had been founded by Stanford alums, who hired a number of other Stanford graduates and were happy to hire computer-science majors from Harvard. But while Wall Street was willing to accept an Ivy League bachelor’s degree in philosophy as proof that someone could grasp the outlines of a credit-default swap, Silicon Valley was less convinced of that as a sign someone would make a good business-development manager. When I asked a member of the class whether a Harvard degree was worth as much in the tech world, where programming skills were king, as elsewhere, the ’06er cupped hands over mouth and whispered, “I really don’t think so.”
Zuckerberg’s departure hadn’t launched a string of expensively educated dropouts heading west: In terms of tech entrepreneurs, there was Alexa Hirschfeld, who co-founded Paperless Post, and Trip Adler of Scribd, a “Netflix for reading,” and, well … people were certain there were other entrepreneurs in their class, but none of their names were coming immediately to mind. The class had entered college on the heels of the first dot-com crash, and most people said that the mind-set required to get into Harvard — academic excellence, extensive extracurriculars, committed SAT prep — didn’t necessarily lend itself to risk-taking. “I don’t think it’s endemic to people from here to take a big risk, because they feel they have a lot to lose,” Alexa Hirschfeld, the Paperless Post founder, told me. Some of the graduates seemed to view a Harvard degree as a set of (very golden) handcuffs: Nearly half of those with job offers at graduation went into either consulting or finance.
“After a week of lobotomized relaxation within the walled confines of the Four Seasons, I started to step out. A few nights later, I found myself traveling down a dimly lit backroads [sic] towards a party at an unknown beach café. I was riding on the back of the scooter of a friend of a friend of an expat I had met on an unnamed iPhone app. And I smiled. Because after years of ever-increasing precision and ambition and discipline and single-minded drive, I suddenly realized that I still had the ability to surprise myself … That was when I decided that everything needed to change.”
Facebook, however, gave Harvard graduates something of a foothold in Silicon Valley, and a number of them had joined the company as its needs expanded beyond engineers. One member of the class said that a friend of hers had been one of the company’s earliest employees with a job in recruiting. “She’s really, really, really, really, really, really, happy now,” she said. In the Red Book, another person recalled a trip to Bali, where he intended to find “an infinity pool worthy of an Instagram shot”:
He quit his job and went to work at Facebook.
On the last day of reunion, after a memorial service for the six members of the class who had died — one from cancer, two from a heart attack, and three from suicide — the alums gathered for waffles branded with the university crest at a brunch in Kirkland House, where Zuckerberg had built Facebook. None of the Facebook founders had shown up for reunion, though I couldn’t help thinking that Zuckerberg would have liked to be there. His name is listed in the Red Book despite the fact that he didn’t graduate. One member of the class told me that she had spoken with someone in the development office, who said donations from the class had been down. “The working theory in the alumni office is that because this is Mark Zuckerberg’s year, people think they don’t have to give any money,” she explained. The university had begun discussions with Zuckerberg about a possible donation, and several people speculated that Harvard would one day give him an honorary degree, as it had done with Bill Gates.
One attendee described his Harvard peers to me as “pathologically competitive” — when one person told me Elise Stefanik was the youngest congressperson ever, at age 30, a chorus of (male) classmates jumped in to point out that she was the youngest congresswoman, preceded by many men—and though almost everyone insisted they were not envious of Zuckerberg, a number were quick to suggest he had somehow been as lucky as he had been visionary. One ‘06er, who said she initially disdained start-ups owing to their focus on “the whole money thing,” but had since started her own, called Facebook merely a “better MySpace.” Another pointed out that a high-school classmate of Zuckerberg’s, who was also a member of the class, had built a similar site at Exeter.
Moore didn’t live with Zuckerberg sophomore year, when Zuckerberg started Facebook and made his roommates unfathomably rich. Moore and Zuckerberg hung out just before Zuckerberg left for California, a decision he told Moore he had reached when two-thirds of the campus had been using Facebook at a single moment. “Even at that time, I wasn’t like, ‘Oh, shit, I should totally go into tech,’” Moore said, after sprinting to grab one more beer from the barbecue’s open bar. It was unseasonably warm in Boston, and Moore wiped his forehead with a handkerchief as he walked me through his post-Harvard career. He briefly avoided the business track of many his classmates, earning an advanced degree in history at a university in The Netherlands, before taking a job with the Boston Consulting Group. That job took him back to Australia, where he met a girl and helped a large tech company launch a site that became “the largest e-commerce company in Indonesia.” He and his girlfriend then poured all of their life savings into a start-up of their own, which sold high-end clothes to Indonesians. Eight years after his former roommate had launched his company, Moore had become an entrepreneur, too.
But the professional envy seemed to have dimmed over time. In the first years after graduation, when they gathered for Harvard-Yale football games, everyone worked hard to present the best version of themselves, justifying their professional choices or expressing disappointment that they weren’t yet changing the world. The fifth reunion was filled with “triumphal course corrections,” as people transitioned from jobs that paid well to jobs they liked. (The guy who built a Facebook-style site at Exeter was now running a vineyard in South Africa.) At the tenth reunion, people had more or less stopped justifying their career in finance and instead simply nodded to their babies.
Being relieved of the pressure to fulfill the impossibly high expectations they once set for themselves seemed to be a great relief to many members of the class, and the competitiveness in the Red Book was less about professional bragging — though there was still plenty of that—than about telling your classmates about a cool vacation, trumpeting your law firm’s maternity-leave policy, or reporting that you’d found the love of your life. (At a party the night before the brunch, I saw someone log in to Tinder — Harvard graduates intermarry so often that the University sends out Valentine’s Day cards to intramural couples — but given how many people in the class had bragged about their marriages in the Red Book, there didn’t seem to be many options.) Others rejected Lean In, by Harvard graduate Sheryl Sandberg. “Everybody’s still super-competitive, but people are becoming human to each other in a way that probably five years ago was not the case,” Bede Moore said.
But the site shut down last fall, and when I asked Moore whether he regretted not living with Zuckerberg, he started his reply several times before settling on an answer. “Do I think that it would have been interesting to have worked with Mark in the construction of that company and to be on the inside of Facebook? Yeah, that sounds really interesting,” Moore said. “And would the outcome of that — getting a lot of money — be great? Hell, yeah! Who would say, ‘I wish I didn’t have $600 million?’” That figure happens to be the estimated Facebook windfall of Chris Hughes, whose role in Facebook’s founding was the closest to Moore’s skill set. But Moore, who is now married and expecting a child, is happy with his life. “To be like, ‘I wish I changed the course of my existence for money’ is kind of a problematic thing to say,” Moore said. He and his wife skipped the brunch to catch a flight to France, where they were visiting another friend from Harvard. Afterward, Moore was going back to Sydney to start working as an employee at a start-up.
*A version of this article appears in the June 13, 2016 issue of New York Magazine.
If the story of PawPaw, the lonely hamburger-eating grandpa turned meme, made you cry, you might want to bust out your tissues now. Last year, a then 18-year-old from Maine named Hallee threw a birthday party for her friends at a bowling alley. Except not a single one of the people she invited showed up, which was, understandably, devastating.
To make sure Hallee has a great time this year, her cousin is asking people to send Hallee cards to celebrate her 19th birthday. The cousin, Rebecca, posted a picture of Hallee, alone at last year’s party, explaining the situation. It’s already been shared more than 150,000 times on Facebook, with plenty of comments from people promising to send cards and even gifts.

First of all, it’s important to understand why Gawker, despite its legal liability and status as a tech billionaire’s object of obsession, is still an attractive proposition. Part of it is straightforward: The seven Gawker Media sites still bring in a reliable 90 million unique visitors monthly, a figure large enough to generate significant advertising revenue.
Or, maybe, six new websites. It’s been heavily implied (if not outright stated) that Gawker’s sale is being marketed to potential buyers under the assumption that gawker.com, the flagship site and the one with the most baggage (legal and ethical), will be shut down. (Or possibly sold separately, or maybe even kept around by Denton.) It is, after all, the site most likely to have made fun of executives, brands, or publications from its new owners
Ziff Davis has already put in a preliminary bid somewhere in the $90 to $100 million range, well below the $250 million Gawker founder Nick Denton was estimating the company was worth last year. But it’s unlikely to be the only bidder in the auction. Univision’s interest in the company has already been reported, but who else might express interest?
Ziff Davis The publisher of PC Magazine, askmen.com, and IGN has already made a bid. Gawker’s “geek” sites — Gizmodo, Kotaku, Lifehacker, and Jalopnik — would fit in easily with the company’s tech-oriented digital properties, and its December purchase of the coupon site offers.com might provide opportunities with Gawker’s e-commerce department

Univision Univision, which bought the Onion and the Root last year and has had trouble gaining traction with its millennial-focused news site Fusion, has explored a partnership with Gawker in the past around its Spanish-language sites. Rumors from earlier this year held that Gawker and Univision had reached a preliminary deal that was scuttled over the Hogan lawsuit; it seems likely that the company will throw its hat in the ring again.

Penske Media The publisher behind a host of entertainment and media-focused publications, including Variety, WWD, HollywoodLife, and, uh, cricketcountry.com, Penske was reportedly looking into Gawker’s financials earlier this year. A sort of inverse Ziff Davis, Penske would be able to fit Gawker’s lifestyle sites easily into its portfolio, and would give the company a foothold in the somewhat more lucrative tech media market.

Vice Vice, Gawker’s longtime foil, is said to be kicking the tires, too. It makes sense: Not only is the company expanding its news operations under Josh Tyrangiel, Vice would be able to absorb Gawker Media’s sites without really requiring them to modify or soften their aggressive sensibilities. So long as they’re not going after big Vice advertisers.

Vox Media Despite a New York Post report from earlier this year, it’s hugely unlikely that Vox will bid on Gawker. Not only is there too much overlap between each company’s brands, Vox CEO Jim Bankoff is said to still hold a grudge against the company from Vox’s early days as SB Nation, when it was a frequent target of Gawker’s sports site, Deadspin.

There’s another part, though: Gawker’s commerce division. Gawker Media is one of few large digital-media organizations to have figured out how to make a boatload of money off of “e-commerce” — that is, affiliate links to Amazon and other retailers, of which purchases Gawker gets a cut. In 2014, the company made about $10 million in e-commerce revenue; last year, it was expected to make even more. Traditional display advertising, meanwhile, has become less and less attractive to publishers, and a big, tech-focused media company — like, say, PC Magazine publisher Ziff Davis — would love to have a proven, knowledgeable, e-commerce operation in-house. If it also gets 90 million new readers and seven new websites, all the better!
Microsoft just announced that it is purchasing LinkedIn for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion. Put in perspective, that’s exactly as many emails as you’ve received from LinkedIn over the last six years.
The deal, which is expected to close by the end of this calendar year, according to a statement from Microsoft, seems insane if you understand LinkedIn only as the company that emails you about high-school classmates “looking to join your network.” But LinkedIn has over 400 million users internationally, and an enormous, business-oriented social graph is worth a lot of money to a company like Microsoft: an enterprise social network for an enterprise software giant. (By “social network,” we mean, as always, data; adding LinkedIn to the family offers Microsoft a huge amount of data about its customers — both individuals and businesses.) And, of course, LinkedIn makes money, thanks to its paid recruitment services and premium accounts, and it has basically no competition.
In an email to his staff today — published, of course, on LinkedIn — LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner explained what life at the company will look like after acquisition. He says the two companies will still operate independently and much of day-to-day operations will remain the same. “Imagine a world where we’re no longer looking up at Tech Titans such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook, and wondering what it would be like to operate at their extraordinary scale — because we’re one of them.” Lofty stuff.
Over at Microsoft, CEO Satya Nadella also let his people know that the enterprise software company would be purchasing the enterprise social network. Or, as he put it, “this deal brings together the world’s leading professional cloud with the world’s leading professional network.” Nadella also has some, let’s say, um, lofty goals for the merger: “Together we can accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Microsoft Office 365 and Dynamics as we seek to empower every person and organization on the planet.” I, for one, can’t wait to be empowered!
“Finally, if you’re not on LinkedIn, join up now and start using,” Nadella said at the end of his email. Which seems like a great growth strategy for LinkedIn.
Perkins was the “P” in KPCB, the powerhouse Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which was founded in 1972, when personal computing was in its nascent stages. Among the firm’s investments were Netscape, America Online, Amazon, and Google. Prior to investing, Perkins was an early employee of Hewlett-Packard.
Perkins followed up the letter with an interview in which, in the midst of half-apologizing for the comparison, he bragged that he could “buy a six-pack of Rolexes” with the enormous, gaudy watch on his wrist.
But in the last couple of years of his life, Perkins was heard from and seen almost never, cast out from the tech world after writing an exceptionally stupid letter to The Wall Street Journal comparing criticism of the superrich to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany.
This kind of brag wasn’t entirely out of character. From the New York Times’ obituary:
“From the Occupy movement to the demonization of the rich embedded in virtually every word of our local newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, I perceive a rising tide of hatred of the successful one percent,” he wrote. “This is a very dangerous drift in our American thinking. Kristallnacht was unthinkable in 1930; is its descendant ‘progressive’ radicalism unthinkable now?”
In 1996, another Perkins yacht, the Mariette, caused a smaller boat to capsize, killing one of its passengers. Perkins was convicted of involuntary manslaughter by a French court. His one-percent lifestyle literally has a body count.
As anyone who’s gotten rich investing will tell you, there’s nothing wrong with being a good businessman and getting rich from it. But Perkins sometimes seemed to believe that it should shield him from complaint. At the very least, he let his money and his lifestyle deafen him to criticism. You can still hear that attitude echoing through the actions of current tech entrepreneurs — Peter Thiel, for example, who recently bankrupted a media company he didn’t like because of its lengthy history of reporting on his failings.
Which ultimately makes Perkins a true pioneer: the man directly responsible for many of the tech industry’s most important developments and ideas, but one who also provided a prime demonstration of how Silicon Valley insulates itself from criticism, and cries foul whenever some of it manages to sneak through.
Apple CEO Tim Cook opened the software conference with a tribute to those affected by the Orlando shooting.
The Apple Watch is getting some exciting tweaks, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook.
For years, iOS users have been making one simple request: Let us uninstall and delete the phone’s default apps — Mail, Notes, and the dreaded Stocks app, among others. This simple request has been at the top of the list for years, since Apple first started allowing third-party developers to create alternate mail and maps apps.
And while the ability to delete first-party apps marks a concession to the fact that Apple’s defaults just aren’t the best anymore, it benefits Apple, too: The company should be able to update software much more quickly and iteratively — no longer would you have to wait for iOS’s next annual release for new features.
Now, the long national nightmare appears to be over. As Owen Williams first pointed out, something curious happened during the iOS keynote. The Stocks app showed up on the iTunes store. Mail is also available. It appears that default iOS apps are being unbundled from the operating system, meaning that they can be updated and managed separately from the core iOS software. We’ve reached out to Apple to confirm and will update if we hear back.
But more importantly, it likely means you can finally uninstall the Stocks app. Thank fucking god.
Apple announced a brand-new operating system called iOS 10. Once you get inside the phone, not a lot has changed, but the lock screen is completely different.
Produced by Christine Nguyen, written by Matt Johnston.
At Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference today the company announced several big changes coming with the next release of its phone operating system, iOS. For starters, Messages is getting a very fun (and very Facebook-influenced) overhaul that gives users more ways to send texts, including video and giant emoji. (And keeps Apple competitive with Facebook’s hugely popular standalone messaging service.)
2. Your Mac will be better optimized for storage. This means fewer notifications that your startup disk is “almost full.” MacOS Sierra will let you program your device to delete unwanted items (like the trash you forgot to delete two months ago) and automatically store others in the cloud to free up space. Apple’s demo showed a MacBook going from 20 gigabytes of free memory to 150 gigs, just by deleting junk.
5. Sending iMessages just got a whole lot more animated. Literally. Under iOS 10, you’ll be able to automatically replace words with emoji, send message bubbles that shake or explode into fireworks, and even include handwritten doodles. (Read more about all these new features here.)
The best thing about texting is that nobody has to decipher your terrible handwriting, but if you long for the days of passed, handwritten notes, this feature is for you. Users will be able to doodle in the app to send handwritten notes and pictures.
What does that mean, though? As the Verge points out, “Microsoft itself has more than 1.2 billion Office users, but it has no social graph and has to rely on Facebook, LinkedIn, and others to provide that key connection.” The social graph is the online networking concept that lays out how users are connected to each other and to their interests and activities — like, say, the software they use and the work they do. At its most basic, it’s just an enormous amount of valuable data about customers, data that Microsoft doesn’t have because its products have no social-networking component, unlike Google and Facebook. (Apple has similarly struggled with this.) Buying LinkedIn buys Microsoft a social graph that it doesn’t have to build.
Law.
You mentioned that the companies are in some ways de facto governments or states — and in fact that is another aspect of this. They have this tremendous challenge — how do you work that. What’s best practices? What do we want from these privately-owned platforms that do many things that government did before? We don’t have a consensus, let me put it that way.
Is it left or right? I don’t know, I don’t care, I don’t think it really matters. That’s not the question. The question is, we have this whole bunch of new tools and powers. Connecting all the humans on Earth, and all the machines, at the same time, allows us to do things on a scale that exceeds nation-states. We have companies with 1.5 billion active customers all collaborating together — that is unheard of on the planet before. And it’s going to become more common. We’re just at the beginning of doing things collectively, collaboratively, at that planetary global scale. That’s the new power. Take Wikipedia, which is simply impossible in theory — there’s no way it can work. And here it is! So you have to figure out — what’s going on? Politically, where’s Wikipedia in relationship to left or right? Now, it’s all certainly going to be governed by politics — politics are always involved. But we’re kind of heading into a territory where those old names — socialism, other -isms — aren’t really very helpful.
Your question is what it will be about. I think it’s going to be in part about the nature of humans. A lot of things we’ll be wrestling with are things like, Is human nature sacred? A lot of people will be interested in the mutability of humans — AIs, genetic engineering, the convergence, changing who we are, this constant rate of change. There will be a lot of political conflict between those who really want to preserve — or resurrect, or keep in front of them — the sacred nature of the soul and the human that is not to be messed with. I think the abortion debate has a little bit to do with that, but I think we’re going to get way beyond that — I think abortion is just a kindergarten spat compared with where we’re going to go when people start to want to mess with their genes.
Right, true.
Can we talk a bit about some of the divergent ways that people see the future? There are obviously a lot of technologists who are very optimistic about where things are going, but in pop culture and elsewhere you also see a lot of fear — people who see dystopian possibilities in where things are headed. You hear a lot of talk about the robot apocalypse, for instance, and people are very anxious about the environment in general. In the book, you write a little bit about the appeal of dystopian visions — that, these days, very few people would want to live in the distant future. Why do you think so many people are so scared of the future? And what about these particular dystopian visions has such a grip on us and our culture?
But something flipped, where the general default version of the future became this dystopia. Which, by the way, Hollywood is very good at, because it’s so cinematic.
It’s a really good question, and I wish I understood this better. I can only make a couple of observations. I am old enough to have enjoyed a period when the future was very golden, when we did want to live in the future. I don’t know when the transition point was, but it seems like somewhere around the year 2000, when we have the whole Y2K thing.
You think those visions have had an effect.
I think it’s part of it — but only part. Science-fiction authors and Hollywood writers have been not capable of painting a friendlier future.
Why not?
What do you mean “bitten”?
In part because it is difficult. It is hard to put all these things together into a place where you want to live. What I’ve tried to do with my book is try to describe at least the near future as a place where people would want to live. I don’t know if I succeeded, but that’s what I was trying to do. Because I do think that when we get there we will prefer to be there than back here — that it will be a bit better. I’m not a utopian, I believe in incremental betterness, and I think it will be a little better. But what that looks like is hard because we’ve been bitten by so many things.
We now realize — it’s what I call technoliteracy — that any technology is going to bite us. Whatever its benefits, there’s also a cost. Things are not in any way without their corresponding downsides. I think that’s kind of a new view, a widespread view — yeah, you have this magic thing, but what else is it going to do to me? I mean — side effects! Just look at a magazine these days — the side effects of these drugs being advertised are like pages long. I mean, how can anyone take these things? And part of that is just disclosure — we’re now in full-disclosure mode.
It’s not an issue of things changing so much, just that the changes will be complicated.
Why do you think that is?
Yeah, I think that Alvin Toffler was right about that. When my grandfather was born, he believed that his life would be just like his grandfather’s — and it was. Now, people are born and the world they’re going to die in will be very very different in many ways, certainly psychologically.
How does it affect you?
And you attribute that anxiety to a kind of techno-shock that started with the Industrial Revolution.
I have a suspicion of the very idea that data can be owned. I don’t find ownership a very good model for data, let me put it that way. I think part of what we have to evolve is some different metaphors, different language, different frameworks, for understanding what’s going on with data.
I actually envision an economy where every single transaction would be public, to some extent. A lot of the people who run Bitcoin and Blockchain are sort of these crypto-anarchists, or at least libertarian, who want to make money currency that is outside the jurisdiction of any kind of state government. But in a curious kind of way, I could imagine governments mandating blockchain or crypto-currency, because, even though there’s anonymity, every single transaction in that system is on the public record. I’m not going to say that’s inevitable, but we certainly, over time, we’ve evolved less tolerance for opaque transactions, and so the logical extension would be that we would head toward making more and more of those transactions public.
The debate over net neutrality has pit internet providers, cable companies, and web platforms against one another since the Federal Communications Commission enacted the rules in February 2015. Under the 2015 FCC decision (the same one upheld today), internet-service providers were classified as common carriers — companies responsible for transporting goods or people and therefore subject to certain special regulatory rules, the most important of which is that they’re responsible for providing service without discrimination. (Bus lines, railroads, and freight companies typically function as common carriers.)
It’s one of the smallest flying robots ever created, and its potential uses include surveillance, search and rescue missions, and even artificial crop pollination.

Probably the most important thing that Apple announced at its keynote opening for the Worldwide Developer Conference, on Monday, concerned changes to its Messages app: features that allowed users new ways of interacting with messages. You’ll soon be able to scribble on messages à la Snapchat; react to messages the same way to you can attach emoji to specific posts in Slack; and add visual flourishes, like fireworks, and confetti, and stage lights, that encompass the entire screen.
In the past, Apple’s been notoriously strict about what users and developers can and can’t do on its systems, and has kept its own apps sandboxed from everything else. Even as recently as a few years ago, email apps and alternative web browsers were not allowed on the App Store, because Apple refused to allow apps that duplicated functions they already supplied.
But the announcements by Apple today indicate that, for the most part, it’s done with the infamously strict oversight of what developers can do on iOS devices, and what parts of the phone they can touch. The iPhone is starting to feel like a device that its users and developers have significant control over, whereas in the past Apple has been frustratingly paternal about what it believes users should and should not be able to do.
In a larger sense, the next big tech struggle is on platforms, not hardware. Apple can’t just have great devices; it needs to have a robust software platform that developers feel like they have a stake in. You can see hints of this in Apple’s tweaks to app-store subscription pricing, and further hints as they make concessions to developers and widen the scope of the iOS SDK.
Over time, Apple’s slowly relented, allowing browsers like Chrome and email apps like Sparrow, as well as third-party keyboards accessible from any app that requires text input. Extensions eventually allowed users to transmit data between apps, and widgets allowed third parties to present data in the device’s Notification Center. Apple has been very slow to open up iOS to third-party developers, worried about what they’d do after having been handed the keys to the kingdom.
It’s not like Apple deserves a lot of credit for this shift. Widgets, and custom backgrounds, and third-party keyboards have been part of Google’s Android practically since its inception. Apple has been slowly arriving at the conclusions that others have already realized, getting to the heart of a central catch-22 in tech design: Withholding capabilities and options from users can lead to a satisfying and uniform experience across the board, but that uniformity can slowly stagnate. On the other hand, placing options in the hands of users almost always leads to them making choices that developers would like to avoid.
The line between feature use and abuse in tech is thin, almost nonexistent. If users can scribble on every note, or specify a custom background on every message, or integrate yet unseen third-party services, it’s not hard to see that those systems will become what Apple might have previously classified as excessive. Take Android, which has a years-long head start on allowing users to launch third-party apps from links instead of first-party ones (now possible on iOS) and grants users the ability to tweak the system-wide font (iOS now graciously lets users select from a handful of options). Whereas iPhone screenshots can be identified by their uniformity, Android screenshots can be identified by the exact opposite — their highly customizable interface.
But that was just a preview of what’s to come. The first-party flourishes were accompanied by an announcement that various aspects of iOS that Apple once ruled with an iron fist were being opened up to developers. New app genres include what amount to plug-ins for the Messages and Maps apps, making third-party functions accessible via first-party programs.
Part of the reason Apple has been able to get away with this for so long is because it’s able to, every single year, position the latest iPhone as the new technological paradigm. The idea that developers couldn’t be trusted to use Apple’s tech responsibly was a serviceable argument for Apple’s tyrannical rule. But now that we’re more than a decade into the smartphone era of computing, and now that mobile comprises the lion’s share of web traffic, the argument that users and developers can’t be trusted to administer their phone responsibly rings false. In iOS 10, Apple will finally let you uninstall their Stocks app, because, one might assume, most users can finally be trusted to know how to reinstall it.
Withholding features that seem basic has long been Apple’s best strategy. They’re never a company that’s first to market — always a few years behind, with a more refined take. But the tweaks Apple has managed to introduce into iOS this year have finally tipped the scales away from Apple and toward users and third-party devs. Undoubtedly, developers will offer users a myriad number of customizations and people will flock to them, creating their own personalized, garish phones just as they created eye-burning Myspace profiles a decade ago. User choice trends toward aesthetic choices made by people who are not design professionals. iOS felt uniform in the past because it made all of the design choices for users, but now the floodgates have opened.
As common carriers, providers are “defined as a utility,” which means “more rigorous policing of broadband providers and greater protections for web users,” the New York Times reports. The decision obviously didn’t thrill companies like AT&T, who stood to lose profits as a result, but companies like Google and Netflix, which rely on ISPs providing unfettered access to their sites, were pleased. (AT&T was one of several broadband companies and lobbying groups behind today’s failed appeal.)
What you think you should get: A Bluetooth speakerWhat you should really get: A Bluetooth speaker and an aux cord
What you think you should get: A phone case with a battery in itWhat you should really get: An external battery pack
In the entire history of Bluetooth, I don’t think anyone has ever paired a device successfully on the first try. Pairing your phone requires you to fiddle with menus and buttons and passcodes on two devices. It’s a nightmare — and doubly so if you’re doing it over the phone. To mitigate confusion, make sure that you buy your dad a nice 3.5-millimeter auxiliary cord to plug into the speaker directly. Its use is self-evident — just plug and play. Plus, you can easily switch devices without pairing and unpairing.
For the speaker, you can’t go wrong with the popular, well-designed, and highly regarded UE Boom ($151, Amazon) or its smaller cousin the Roll ($96, Amazon). For the cable: Gold-plated cables are a sham; you can splurge on this six-foot cable from Monoprice ($3).
If your dad is constantly running out of juice, he might be interested in one of those smartphone cases with extra battery built right in. But as a strict adherent to not using a case, I can’t recommend them. I much prefer to have a dedicated external lithium battery with USB ports on it. They’re simple to use, and you can just keep them in your car or bag until any of your devices need a charge. (If there’s one thing dads love, it’s carrying extra gear with them.) And with multiple ports, you can charge multiple devices at once. A phone case only works for your phone, but an external battery works on everything. Best of all, if you already have one of these, just regift your old one.
What you think you should get: A set-top box like an Apple TV or a RokuWhat you should really get: A TV with a Netflix button
You used to only be able to get Netflix (or Amazon or HBO Go, etc.) via set-top boxes like the Apple TV. And while we recommend that anyone remotely tech-savvy get one for themselves, they add yet another remote and another HDMI cord to the nest of cables in your dad’s living room, and are among the chief reasons for parents calling their children for IT support. Luckily, many televisions now have Wi-Fi capabilities and apps baked right into the set itself, negating the need for another piece of hardware. Even better, get a set with a remote control that has a Netflix button built in. That way you don’t have to coach your dad through the menu to find the Netflix app.
If you want to be really sure, Netflix has a section on its site dedicated to the newest models it recommends. If you’re looking to save a bit, here’s last year’s. If you just want a model, try the Vizio M43-C1 ($625, Amazon), a 43” screen that Wirecutter recommends — Vizio’s TVs have fine Netflix interfaces and, importantly, a button on the remote.
What you think you should get: A Kindle without 3GWhat you should really get: A Kindle with 3G
Kindle models with 3G run the price gamut from $170 to $360, but the Paperwhite ($100, Amazon) is a favorite.
Father’s Day is coming this Sunday, and along with it another great annual tradition: helping your dad set up new tech. Sure, you could get him a new laptop, but you’re also inadvertently signing up for an entire afternoon of helping set it up. Below are some gifts that will be just as appreciated, but don’t require too much work to set up or use.
In the past, we’ve recommended battery chargers with built-in wall prongs, like this Zagg external pack ($20, Amazon). I’m personally fond of the Anker Astro ($47, Amazon), but maybe also grab a cheaper pocket-sized one. These things are always on sale and you really can’t go wrong.
If you’re willing to shell out a little more, Amazon’s e-readers come with global 3G access, allowing your dad to buy books and sync data wherever he goes. The additional perk is that now you won’t get a call whenever he can’t get it to connect to Wi-Fi — the device will just flip over to 3G and he won’t know the difference.
What you think you should get: A new router and modemWhat you should really get: An outlet plug that power-cycles
Try, for example, the Tech Restarter ($22, Amazon). You might also try the recently viral ResetPlug ($60).
Router and modem problems — almost certainly the number-one IT problem children of pre-internet parents are forced to solve — are almost always fixed by power-cycling, which is an obtuse way of saying “unplug it and plug it back in again.” There are plenty of outlet plugs available that will do this for you regularly and automatically, so that neither you or your dad have to root around under the desk for the right plug to yank out.
The 2015 ruling also marked the first time net neutrality was applied to mobile internet carriers in addition to traditional internet-service providers. Before 2015, wireless internet providers were not subject to the same rules and regulations as providers like Comcast. AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile all initially spoke out against the changes, claiming the newly enforced rules would harm a competitive mobile market. T-Mobile’s CEO John Legere later recanted saying he was for internet rules like “no discrimination” and “no blocking,” the Verge reported. (An interesting turn given that Legere is behind T-Mobile’s Binge On plan, which lets users stream from a set group of services, like Sling, Netflix, Hulu, and Spotify, without using any data. The plan uses a legally questionable practice known as “zero-rating,” which prioritizes certain products and platforms over others. Legere, for his part, has also said he is “fairly confident” Binge On is legal under the new Open Internet Rules, since any company that meets T-Mobile’s requirements can participate. Like we said, it’s questionable.)
Nintendo is bringing out the big guns this year at E3, the video-game industry’s annual convention, dedicating the vast majority of their showing to a single game, the next entry in the seminal Legend of Zelda series. This, folks, is literally a game changer.
When it comes out next year, the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will be the first major Zelda console release in five years. It’s a substantial departure from the formula that Nintendo has hewn closely to in the past, featuring open-world gameplay, and other features cribbed from more modern games.
It is weird to celebrate the arrival of a jump button — the most basic of video-game-button functions — in 2016, but here we are. In past games, Link would only jump automatically when running off of a ledge. He could also kinda leap to the side while in combat. Now, players can jump whenever and wherever they choose.
Also, Link can jump now. Into the air! There is a jump button players can press, so that Link can jump whenever he wants.
Astonishing. This is an oddly big deal.
Earlier this week, Snapchat announced the company is making some major changes to its advertising strategy. Now, ads will pop up between your friends’ stories. (If you’re not a regular Snapchatter or a teen, stories are a series of snaps that live for 24 hours on the app and are visible to a user’s friends.)
This comes after an app update that changed the way content from publishers and brands is accessed on the platform. Those stories were redesigned to appear with images and headlines to make them more enticing to viewers.
The changes, like many of Snapchat’s past advertising updates, are smart. (Reminder: This is a company that got millions of people to gleefully turn themselves into walking, talking Taco Bell billboards without so much as batting a hot-sauce covered eyelash.) Not to mention, if they work, the new ad partnerships and the revenue they generate will leave the 4-year-old company ripe for an IPO we all know is maybe/probably/likely coming.
Anybody who has ever watched a video online will tell you, ads can be a pain. But they are also a necessary, um, evil, that let you watch your content for “free.” The key difference between an ad before a Snapchat story and an ad on, say, a YouTube video of a corgi being vacuumed, is that since the content waiting on the other side of that ad was generated by a friend of mine, I’m less likely to say “screw it” at the thought of watching a Pantene shampoo spot before getting to what I want to see. (Like a 30-second-long series of selfies from a friend using the puppy filter to make himself look hotter. I’m onto your tricks, puppy filter.)
Will I complain about Snapchat’s new ads? Probably. But will I keep watching? Yes.
A large part of what Snapchat does so well with advertising is capitalize on blending user-generated and sponsored content, like the update earlier this June which allowed users to subscribe to their favorite branded stories. (If a user subscribes, the branded stories appear in their feed beneath stories from their friends, in addition to appearing in their standard spot at the top of the user feed.)
While there won’t be an ad between every one of your friend’s stories (Snapchat wants to build revenue, not drive people screaming from the platform), the ads are coming and you’re probably going to notice them. (Though Snapchat is likely banking on you not noticing them too much.) Advertisers are going to be able to enhance their ads, which means you’ll also be able to swipe up on any given ad and it will install an app for a brand or direct you to a longer video, website, or instant article, like a fun, revenue-driven rabbit hole.
Snapchat also announced changes to its application programming interface, or API, which will let companies purchase campaigns without having to work out an individual deal with Snapchat. All ads are going to be reviewed for quality and Snapchat is currently recommending a select group of creative firms and ad-tech companies to help brands design optimal snaps.
Do you like reading? Me too. It’s great. Words! Sentences! Exclamation points! Just don’t expect to do too much reading on Facebook in the near future. Facebook’s vice-president for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, Nicola Mendelsohn, told the audience at a Fortune conference in London on Tuesday that we can expect the platform to “be probably all video” in five years.
Given how small the company actually is, it’s kind of ridiculous how much power Twitter has come to wield over political discourse. In terms of coverage volume, Hillary Clinton (well, her social media team) telling Donald Trump to delete his account was as big a story as any policy position or primary last week. The humble and unprofitable microblogging service may have trouble competing with Facebook for ad money, but it’s sure established its place in the firmament: The Clinton super-pac Correct the Record set aside a cool $1 million just to combat Bernie bros in 140 characters or fewer.
“I just think if we look already, we’re seeing a year-on-year decline on text,” Mendelsohn said. “We’re seeing a massive increase … on both pictures and video. If I was having a bet [about Facebook five years from now], I would say: video, video, video.” Which sounds about right since Facebook users are already consuming 100 million hours of video on mobile devices alone every day, Nieman Labs reports. It makes sense given Facebook’s recent emphasis on all things video, which includes monetization. (You might have noticed anytime someone you follow goes live on Facebook you get a notification and the video is at the top of your timeline. There’s a reason for that.)
If you spend some time looking at the replies to Trump’s tweets, you’ll see three accounts pop up, over and over: @keksec__org, @NeilTurner_ and @WhiteGenocideTM. Tweet after tweet, they’re the first responders to Trump, no matter what subject or time of day, and he’s retweeted all three of them. Sure: It’s possible to stalk a celeb’s social-media feed 24/7, and whip out a reply or a demand for feet pics quickly. But these accounts do it day in, day out at a speed that can only be described as inhuman.
Trump also signal boosts the nice things his millions of followers say about him — even when those followers happen to be overt white supremacists who spread intense anti-Semitic propaganda. In January, he retweeted an account called @WhiteGenocideTM; he’s retweeted white-nationalist account @NeilTurner_ five times and fellow-traveler @keksec__org “repeatedly,” per a Fortune analysis of Trump’s relationship to the #WhiteGenocide community on Twitter. (Yikes!) Naturally, he’s received a fair share of bad press for these followers of his.
But it’s fair to say that one candidate dominates Twitter. Trump is Twitter’s first real presidential candidate. The mogul had already built a powerful following on the service before he jumped into the political sewer, but his presidential run has amplified his reach and allowed him to take micro-potshots at his many foes in between press conferences. His posts get hundreds of replies from sycophants and detractors alike.
I extracted three months’ worth of Twitter replies to Trump from their accounts and compared their time stamps to the original tweets. @keksec__org had the fastest, with an average response time of two seconds. @NeilTurner_ was only slightly slower, but still within three seconds on average, as was @WhiteGenocideTM. Considering that the majority of these replies have images attached, you quickly realize that it’s not physically possible to compose a tweet, attach a file, and submit it in that period of time.
So how do these bots work? All three accounts are pushing replies through an automated app, which you can see by examining the metadata of the tweets. Bergkamp’s (of @keksec__org) is called “Twitter Helper 3.0.” White Genocide’s is called “Stopping White Genocide.” The Neil Turner account seems to use several programs, most of them titled some variation of “Austrian Painter” (a not-so-subtle Hitler reference).
Another clue that these replies aren’t written by humans is in the context. Only rarely do they have anything to do with the subject of Trump’s original tweet. Typically they tweet short, positive statements about Trump with image memes attached.
The Trump-replying is just a fraction of their total activity, which helps mask the automated tweets. All three accounts do healthy business retweeting each other and fellow travelers, like alt-right figureheads Ricky Vaughn and Mike Cernovich. Turner’s account also automatically replies to Hillary Clinton and George Soros.
Interestingly enough, the bots do have some semblance of intelligence. When Trump mentions Hillary Clinton in his original post, all three of them reply with a meme about the presumptive Democratic candidate. Before the smoke cleared and the bodies were buried in the Republican primary, Trump’s mentioning “Ted” and “Marco” got replies denigrating Cruz and Rubio.
I spoke with Bergkamp via Twitter direct message. Initially he denied knowledge of any Twitter bots, but eventually fessed up. “I’m someone that flies around the world for work … however, this doesn’t give me the chance to always support Trump and prevent crazed Liberals from getting the top tweets to his post,” he told me. “Hence I automated some of my tweeting. However, the reason why I’m not too open about it, is because it’s a bit of a gray area in Twitter’s rules.”
The only one of the three that has any profile outside of Twitter is Jason Bergkamp, who writes for Vanguard14, a white-nationalist site that runs headlines like “Do you eat Corn Flakes? You eat Negro Piss.”
He’s not wrong. Twitter actually has a set of guidelines barring automated replies and mentions (which is what’s happening here), but they were written to work against spammers, not political trolls. The service prohibits mass-mentioning and mass-replying to large groups of people, but says nothing about automated replies to a single account. Interestingly enough, Bergkamp seemingly disabled his bot shortly after we spoke.
But on mobile Twitter — where most people use it — replies are sorted only by time. That means that the most-prized real estate under a popular tweet is the first reply. And that’s the brilliance of these bots. With an incredibly low outlay of resources, you can piggyback on a user’s massive reach (Trump has nearly nine million followers) to deliver your own message, whether it be white nationalism or pictures of that one pig with huge balls. In practice, this means that people who read Trump’s tweets on their phones are likely to see him replied to with messages of support. It might be small stakes, but it can also create the distinct impression that Trump has more, and more zealous, support than he actually does.
So how do you push back? Now that we know how these Trump bots work, it’s time to build our own. I asked Bergkamp how his was made and he was gracious enough to reply: “It’s written in Python and converses with a PHP back-end via an API through JSON calls.”
So let’s get cracking. I don’t know Python but I know a little PHP, and that should be good enough.
The value of having the first reply is something the internet has been obsessed with for a while. On Twitter’s desktop platform replies aren’t always displayed in chronological order. The service’s algorithm pops comments with high engagement (replies, retweets , and likes) to the top of the pile and hides others. Being first doesn’t necessarily guarantee being seen.
Now that I could monitor precisely when Trump tweeted, I had to compose a response. I decided to have my robot reply to Donald Trump with randomly chosen lyrics from Kid Rock’s 1998 breakthrough hit “Bawitdaba.”
I then wrote a script to look at the ID of the most recent tweet and compare it to the text file. If they matched, Trump hadn’t issued a new tweet. If they didn’t match, he had — update the text file with the new ID.
I set up a Twitter account at @bawitdonald to be the robot’s public face and connected it to Twitter’s API. Then I wrote a script to send a tweet with the response ID set to the new ID of Trump’s tweet; the text randomly selected from my database; and an image of Trump’s face photoshopped onto Kid Rock’s body from an archive of them I made.
The first thing I did was use Twitter’s API to get the most recent tweet in Donald Trump’s timeline, filtered to exclude replies and retweets. Every tweet has a unique ID number, so I saved the ID of that most recent tweet in a text file.
Finally, it was time to pull the trigger. Twitter limits queries to a user’s timeline to 300 every 15 minutes, so I set it to update every 5 seconds. The downside of this bot, being written entirely in PHP, is that it needs to be in an open web-browser window to function, so I set up an old laptop and devoted it to the cause.
It worked brilliantly. My response time was consistently under five seconds, fast enough to put me with the other bots and significantly quicker than any other human. I built a large-enough repository of Kid Rock lyrics that I didn’t have to worry about repeating tweets, even during Trump’s most manic periods.
It took me a little under three hours to write this code, which will run continuously as long as I keep a browser window open. I didn’t need a big check from David Brock to occupy one of the top spots on Trump’s reply timeline — just StackExchange and a few spare hours. It’s obvious that the appearance of mass popular support can influence coverage. But the fact that such an appearance can so easily be skewed by one person with a simple program running in a web browser should make candidates very worried indeed.
Mendelsohn also noted that Facebook Live videos attract ten times more comments than their non-live (Facebook Dead doesn’t have a great ring to it) counterparts, Fortune reports. Which is good news for Chewbacca mom and bad news for anybody who wanted to keep their timeline exactly as it is right now: a hotbed for friends from high school sharing charmingly offensive “news” stories from Huzlers.
Music-streaming service Spotify is teaming up with dating service Bumble, the app where only women can start the conversation with a match. Starting in the next few weeks, Bumble users will be able to link their accounts to Spotify and potential matches will then be able to see the artists they listen to the most. You’ll have to opt in to the new feature, which is good for anybody who doesn’t want to electively tell people they are hoping to bang … I mean, people they are hoping to date, that they secretly love Nickelback.
Here’s the thing, though. Some of the awful people Trump is retweeting aren’t even people. They’re robots.
The goal of the partnership, Spotify explained, is “to help people make more meaningful connections with music taste in mind.” Which might actually work. (At least until Bumble users enable the option to hide artists they don’t want matches to see on the app.) Unlike Tinder, which lets users connect to their Instagram accounts (a social platform notorious for selective curation), your Spotify history likely isn’t filtered. If you’re a big Blues Traveler, Nicki Minaj, or Linkin Park fan, your potential matches are going to know.
Or as the old dating adage goes: If you can’t handle me at my worst (“I just listened to Justin Bieber’s ‘Sorry’ 32 times in a row”), then you can’t have me at my best (“I just listened to Justin Bieber’s ‘Sorry’ 32 times in a row”).
Let this be a warning to anyone in the public eye: If you wear an outfit that looks like a green screen, you will become fodder for the internet to Photoshop.
The queen dressed in dog is a nice look, though we, and Queen Elizabeth probably, would have preferred a corgi-covered suit.
Why so serious, Your Highness? (But in all seriousness, Queen Elizabeth, thank you for being such a bright spot amidst the darkness that is the internet.)
This one’s an easy joke, but I’m still laughing. (And queuing up “Pretty Vacant” on Spotify.)
In the internet’s great tradition of editing pictures for fun, this week people on Imgur descended upon a picture of Queen Elizabeth celebrating her 90th birthday and rocking some serious Dat Boi vibes in a bright-green suit.
Apple’s WWDC kicked off on Monday, and while the company released plenty of changes, including message “emojification,” and voice-mail transcription, we’re not expecting to see the next iPhone until next fall. Which means there’s still plenty of time to indulge in iPhone rumors, like the possibility of a different color option with the new phone (which will likely be called the iPhone 7).
Last week, two members of BuzzFeed’s video team were fired for reportedly violating non-compete clauses in their employment agreements. According to Politico, Jenny Lorenzo and Brittany Ashley were let go because they appeared in a non-BuzzFeed web series, “Gente-Fied,” produced by America Ferrera and focusing on Latinx experiences.
As the news trickled out, people formerly affiliated with BuzzFeed’s video department — officially known as BuzzFeed Motion Pictures — spoke out, criticizing the company for its use and enforcement of non-compete clauses.
The two employees who left had little to say about leaving BuzzFeed, almost certainly due to strict non-disclosure agreements.
The use of non-competes at BuzzFeed is unsurprising: Such clauses are common at other start-ups, where they usually cover programmers and engineers. According to Politico, Buzzfeed’s non-compete clauses prevent “work for companies considered to be competitors for three months after leaving the company” (and presumably, while on contract with BuzzFeed). But Politico’s sources say that “the non-compete clause is enforced unevenly by management, and that the agreement is vague about what constitutes as a competing project.”
BuzzFeed has put a lot of effort into building its performers into bona-fide internet celebrities, complete with rabid teen fandoms. It’s signed contracts with some of its top talent to keep them in the BuzzFeed farm system while also letting them incubate their own ideas. But unlike the Hollywood system that BuzzFeed is trying to both leverage and usurp, BuzzFeed’s talent doesn’t have union protection.
Exactly what BuzzFeed offers these creators in return is unclear, as the terms of the deals are not public. Its young millennial workforce is compensated in free snacks, cool factor, swag, celebrity photo ops … and just enough money to pay the rent. Which is a good reason to take a side gig in the first place.
And it’s young. For many employees, BuzzFeed is a chance to get a lot of recognition quickly and easily — but in exchange, they’re signing away pretty much everything. Not just the creative work they do for the company (which is fairly standard), but also their names and likenesses. A quick Facebook query pulls up dozens of pages not just for BuzzFeed brands like Tasty, but also BuzzFeed video personalities, some of them for people who have long left the company. BuzzFeed still controls the page for above-quoted Gaby Dunn, referring to her as an alumnus and using her likeness. Not much has been done with it since May of last year, but the page has more than 122,000 fans that BuzzFeed could easily convert into an audience if it so chose.
This week, the internet is buzzing about a rumor from Japanese Mac blog Macotakara, which claims they have “reliable information” that the iPhone 7 won’t be available in the space gray. In its place, the device will come in dark blue.
Martin Hajek, a designer who specialized in 3-D renderings, created some mock-ups of what the new color might look like.
As a true-blue (sorry) fan of the color navy (seriously, ask my fourth-grade teacher about my less-than-inspired poem devoted to the hue), these pictures have me humming Jack’s Mannequin and praying to the ghost of Steve Jobs this actually happens. Of course, we’ll have to wait and see if this rumor actually means the demise of space gray, which was Apple’s top-selling color when it was first released with the iPhone 5S (though this was before everyone from bros to your mother went gaga for rose gold.)
Compared to the space-gray iPhone 6, Hajek’s designs also lack visible antenna lines across the back, another rumor about the forthcoming iPhone.
Google and Levi’s teamed up to create this high-tech spin on the classic denim jacket.
Do you vape? Do you vape in public? Do you drive a car? This new gadget from Vaped Vaporizers might just be the best your best bet for combining those hobbies. (Also, if you answered yes to most of those questions, please feel free to purchase a “Bad Ass” bumper sticker for your car.)
The device retails for $170 and is engineered to look just like a key fob, complete with lock and unlock buttons that double as on and off buttons. It’s compatible with herb marijuana, which means you’ll be able to put cannabis buds directly into the vape. “Loose will work, but packed a little tight will get you more hits per session,” the company explains.
On the other side of the Vaped Fob is a winged logo that will definitely trick your friends into think you drive a very cool car. Like a Mini Cooper.
Happy almost Father’s Day. In honor of the holiday, may I present Twitter’s favorite dad? Or at least Twitter’s favorite dad this week.
Justine, an 18-year-old from California, was out eating breakfast with her father when she noticed he was acting strange. “He was staring at me with a lil smirk so I knew something was up,” she told me via Twitter DM. Across the table, her dad had turned his pancakes into an edible Pac-Man, complete with butter pats as substitute pac-dots and a ghost drawn on a napkin.
“My dad and I have always been huge dorks, so it was really just a regular thing to see but it was still super funny,” Justine said. Nearly 40,000 people have retweeted and faved the pictures since she shared them on Twitter. “It’s funny because this isn’t my first tweet that’s gone viral on Twitter lol,” she also explained, referencing her prom pictures which were also shared by a few thousand people in April.
Justine said she and her dad like to goof around and “tend to bond over things like that [the Pac-Man pancakes], we like to go to arcades and jam to oldies,” Justine said, noting some favorites, “Queen, The Temptations, and The Beach Boys.” As for going viral, Justine told me her dad, in classic dad fashion, doesn’t quite “get it.” “He’s just been laughing about it! I told him when I saw people posting it and he was like what? Why??? He couldn’t understand what ‘making it’ on Twitter was haha.”
Daaaaaaaad!
The puppy filter is the best filter on Snapchat. What about the “pretty” filter? you ask. (The one that people have argued is designed to make people look “whiter.”) What of the Coachella-goer filter of choice, which plops an animated flower crown onto your head and adds a little twinkle to your eyes? What about the rainbow-vomit filter?
No. I brook no argument. Each pales in comparison to the puppy, the reigning king of all filters.
Snapchat filters rotate, which means you never know what will be available when you open the app on any given day. Earlier in June, the puppy filter went on hiatus and people did not take it particularly well.
And they’re not the only ones weirdly obsessed with the filter. Ariana Grande is a fan.
As is Kim Kardashian, who may or may not be the reason Snapchat changed the puppy filter. Now, when you use the filter with someone else, a second dog face, a dalmatian, will appear over the second person’s face.
It even looks good on a tiny, grainy Barack Obama.
Why is the puppy filter the best filter? Because everyone looks good in the puppy filter. This is widely observed but little-understood. Why does everyone look good? For one thing, because it makes you look like a cute cartoon dog, and everyone loves cartoon dogs.
More importantly, though, the puppy filter does a few distinct things to your face beyond just slapping ears, nose, and a giant, just slightly erotic, animated tongue on it: It smooths your skin, widens your eyes, and visibly thins your face. In other words, it does some of the same things the “pretty” filter does, but in a less noticeable way, thanks to the, you know, dog features.
But the dog features aren’t just there to hide fashion-mag-style airbrush tweaks. My co-workers Brian Feldman and Leah Rodriguez have theorized that what makes the puppy filter so appealing is that it covers your nose — “the butthole of the face.” If you’ve ever been an insecure teen with access to a mirror, there is a good chance you’ve spent some years in your life hating your nose. My childhood orthodontist once said to me, “when your teeth are straight, your nose won’t look so big!” But who needs straight teeth when you have the puppy filter?
So, while using the puppy Snapchat filter certainly isn’t the same thing as getting your face surgically reconstructed, it works in a similar fashion. In addition to your smoothed and thinned face, your nose, which likely isn’t celebrity-level perfect, is obscured by the filter. And in its place, you get another, perfectly symmetrical, schnoz. Think of the puppy filter as the world’s cheapest (actually, the app is free), temporary nose job. One that just happens to also turn you into a puppy.
Snapchat declined to comment on this story.
The easiest and quickest way for news websites to make money is to find large audiences; the easiest and quickest way to find large audiences is to write articles that are widely shared on Facebook. “Shares” are the most important metric in the world right now.
Anyhow, here’s a story I’m working on.
And, according to a depressing new study, via the Washington Post, “59 percent of links shared on social media have never actually been clicked.” The widely accepted assumption that a social-media share indicates an engaged reader or viewer who cares about what they’re sharing is false. You could put a good headline over 2,000 words of gibberish and people would share it.
In the first few years of their existence, activity trackers from companies like Fitbit and Jawbone were appealing despite their looks. Want to count your steps? Great! Here’s a chunky plastic garbage bracelet. Have fun. Wear long sleeves.
For more advanced features, mostly heart-rate monitoring, you’ll still need to get something rubbery and blockish. If you’re just looking for confirmation that you actually moved that day, though, it’s gotten easy enough to put a wearable on your wrist that you’d (maybe, possibly) wear even if all it did was look purdy.
Over the last 18 months or so, though, something changed. As the bits and pieces that go inside a fitness tracker get smaller, wearables makers are better-equipped to give half a thought to design.
Withings kicked off the trend of activity trackers that looked like watches about a year and a half ago. The Activité, a Swiss-made timepiece, was indistinguishable from most wristwatches, aside from a secondary interior dial that ticks off not minutes or hours but progress toward a daily step goal.
That original Activité has no shortage of fancy going for it — I don’t know what “Barenia leather from Haas Tanneries” means, but it sounds hell of classy — but its $450 price tag seems a bit excessive unless you truly love its look. I’d instead try the Activité Steel, which sports a similar-enough look that you’d easily confuse the two at a glance. The Steel also comes with a choice of nine different silicon straps, which means you can get it a little sweaty as you step your way to something resembling fitness. You can even swim with it.
Other fun features? It tracks your sleep, has a silent vibrating alarm, automatically adjusts when you change time zones, and pairs with Withings’ Health Mate app for a full accounting of steps, calories, distance, and more.

Smartphones pretty much torpedoed the dashboard navigation, but Garmin’s got a side gig making surprisingly good activity trackers. Its latest happens to look like a really, really nice watch.
Most of what you can say about the Activité Steel applies here, too, though instead of one extra hand measuring steps, the Vívomove opts for two bars. One checks your progress, the other shows how long you’ve been motionless. Otherwise, the features are largely the same, although the Garmin doesn’t have an alarm.
The real differences are aesthetic. The Vívomove is bigger than the Activité Steel, in a way that some folks might prefer, and offers mounds more customization. You can select from five different finishes, and a variety of interchangeable bands. *Choice* isn’t exactly the same as *fashion*, but right now it’s the closest you can get.

Not that it needs to be repeated for the one-billionth time, but mobile devices are big. They are where people, for lack of a less stodgy term, consume content nowadays. Not just traditional formats like film and television, but also YouTube videos, and Snapchats, and Vines, and the like.
This week, Digiday is reporting that National Geographic, known worldwide for Good Video, has “caved to vertical video.” Camerapeople “are now shooting videos with the understanding that the footage might be used either horizontally or vertically.”
For years, video snobs have been waging a futile war against vertical video — that is, video that is taller than it is wide. It’s footage shot by someone holding a phone … vertically, the way phones in nearly all cases are meant to be held.
The impulse against vertical video made sense a half decade ago, when most web users viewed content via the desktop, but as mobile has become increasingly dominant, every argument against vertical video has been invalidated.
In 2010, Gizmodo wrote this about vertical video:
Or consider this bad argument from Reviewed.com written in December 2014 (just 18 months ago!), pleading for horizontal video:
Those black bars don’t exist on mobile, which, to reiterate, is how most people now watch online video.
Okay, this argument makes a little more sense when you’re staring at an IMAX screen that’s eight stories tall. But try this: Hold your phone horizontally in front of you. Can you see the entire screen? You can. Okay, now turn your phone vertically. Can you still see the entire screen? You can. The binocular sight argument is irrelevant for small screens.
Along with that, let’s consider selfies. The human form, generally speaking, is taller than it is wide. It’s easier to capture more of the subject when the lens is aligned with the vertical axis of its subject, not perpendicular to it. So it would make sense that vertical is the way to go.
Mobile devices, and Snapchat in particular, are to be credited for the rise of vertical video, and in his own defense of the form last year, New York Times writer Farhad Manjoo reported that “[u]ploads of tall videos have grown 50 percent [on YouTube] in 2015.” The battle is over.
The most unexpected by-product of this shift is that it has reframed (pun intended) what the big black spaces surrounding vertical video mean. They used to immediately signal that the person filming was an amateur, or that they were lazy, or that they had no respect for the filmic arts. Now those black bars represent the minority — if you see them, it means that you’re not experiencing the video as it was truly meant to be seen (and also that you’re old as hell).
If you’d prefer a bracelet to a watch —especially important if you already have a watch you use and like — the Jawbone UP2 can almost sort of maybe pass as something you’d wear anyway. It comes in six different colors, each with a different etched design, and while the gold/black combo is incredibly gaudy the rest aren’t half bad.
As for what you’re getting, the UP2 can track steps and sleep, just like the watches do, and, yes, has a vibrating alarm (that keeps coming up because it’s a better feature than you’d think, promise), and pairs with Jawbone’s excellent UP app. That last part’s especially important, because the UP2 doesn’t have any sort of display on it. Any info you get about your workout that day — aside from a celebratory buzz if you hit your goal — has to come through your phone.
Which is fine! Staring at your wrist all day to see how far you’ve moved is exhausting. Besides, it’s not like you don’t have your phone out most of the time anyway.
One quick note: Jawbone might be getting out of the fitness-tracker business. The good news is, that means you can get a UP2 for very cheap right now. The bad news is, it’s not guaranteed there will be software-side support for it a year or two from now. Also, get one with the loop band, not the solid band. The solid band is … bad.

If you absolutely can’t live without some sort of real-time visual feedback from a slim activity tracker, the best you’re going to do is the Fitbit Alta. Which is still pretty good! It’s a little chunkier than the UP2, but in exchange you get a display that shows not just your progress, but also call and text notifications, and any calendar alerts you’ve got set up.
The Alta’s silicon band comes in four colors, or you can upgrade to leather or stainless steel. The tracker itself can pop in and out of any of these, so you can dress up or dress down your quantified self as needed. Otherwise, it pretty much does what the UP2 does. It just does a better job of keeping you in the loop.

If you were wandering the streets in Perm, Russia, yesterday, you might have spied a robot that looked like a combination of WALL-E and Rosie from The Jetsons wandering the streets.
The robot, which allegedly “escaped” from the Promobot research lab, was able to make its great escape because the genius humans who, you know, engineered a robot capable of giving directions and remembering everyone it speaks to, supposedly forgot to close the gate. (I’m laughing but skeptical given that the Promobot YouTube channel miraculously has clear video of the capture and the company’s blog has some photos of the incident that feel not exactly candid.)
Officially known as Promobot V2, the robot fled into the surrounding roads and made it over 150 feet in about 40 minutes before being captured and taken prisoner once again in the name of science, Russian news site Argumenty i Fakty reported.
The robot could have kept going had its battery not died. Which bodes well for humans in the event of any impending robot takeovers.
Donald Trump is many things. Businessman. TV star. Presidential candidate. Hair haver. Jet owner. Orator. Large collection of human cells. All of those things and maybe one or two more. Oh yeah, racist.
But one thing that Donald Trump is not is an enormous anime robot capable of destroying the planet.
But what if he was? It’s not as crazy as you think. Check out this highly scientific simulation by web artist Mike Diva.
If you’re a one-issue voter whose issue is anime, then this vid’s for you.
When Facebook first introduced On This Day — which alerts you, daily, to posts you wrote on the same date in the past — I was apathetic. I was satisfied with the narcissistic nostalgia fix I got from a similar service called TimeHop, a virtual wax museum of previous selves. (“We’re standing in front of 2008 Natalie, who decided she was Blair Waldorf and proved it by accumulating four drawers’ worth of headbands. If you move to your left, you’ll find 2009 Natalie … ”)
Relationship memories are where On This Day gets you. Did you know you observed events like your ex’s birthday and your anniversary every day for a month, like Ramadan? LOOK AT YOURSELF, IDIOT, On This Day screams! But its no-frills presentation robs you of the ability to retroactively romanticize. There is nothing less romantic than Facebook, after all. If Gatsby had had access to On This Day, he would have looked at his wall-to-wall with Daisy and said, “Weird that she untagged herself in all the photos I posted of us. And wait, she never liked any of my statuses? Hmmmm, wow, very messed up.” He would have posted a photo of the green light with a cryptic caption or the surprisingly enigmatic single emoji and started moving on.
My engagement with On This Day had been an exercise in making fun of my younger self. But my younger self started to earnestly encourage me, unbeknownst to her. I found comfort in following young Natalie as she picked up the pieces of her heart day by day; knowing she was going to make it to the other side gave me confidence that I would, too. Looking back gave me hope to look forward.
On January 22, 2010, On This Day reminded me, I’d posted “adventures in new haven?” This beckoned to me because I vividly recalled the circumstances: My freshman year at NYU, I went up to Yale to see a friend in Stephen Sondheim’s Passion and ran into my ex-boyfriend while on campus. Did I hook up with him? Of course! Did the encounter end with me wailing “you hurt me” and stumbling out of his dorm room? Oh, absolutely!
As ridiculous as On This Day is, it can be a valuable reminder of your own resilience. I went through a breakup recently and was horrified to discover that the armor of acidic irony I’d purchased to protect my emotions was purely decorative and not functional (contacting manufacturer re: this defect). Breakups still feel very bad! In 2016! There’s still the walking around with a lump in your throat so big you can’t be sure you’re not about to projectile vomit your heart onto the sidewalk; there’s still the seeing him for the first time in public since the end and your brain becoming a cacophony of voices shouting, “Do not cry just act cool and seem fun and please WHATEVER YOU DO do not shout ‘I’M VERY SAD’ in this crowded room oh God please stop thinking about shouting ‘I’M VERY SAD’ in this crowded room you are going to actually shout ‘I’M VERY SAD’ in this crowded room.”
And don’t worry about her — she just got back from a postgrad senior trip to the Dominican Republic, where she made out with a jock who didn’t give her the time of day in high school. She also is going to stop pretending to like Entourage for boys soon. She’s going to be fine.
Days later, we went even further back in time, and the origin of my profound empathy for the most wretched character in musical-theater history began to unfold, in a sort of lower-stakes version of Memento. January 28, 2009: “Natalie Walker is so excited for this weekend.” This status was the character in a slasher film who splits off from the group to go have sex 19 minutes in. Natalie was headed for danger! “DONT BE GIRL U ABOUT TO GET DUMPED,” I warned.
I saw no need for a Facebook-specific copycat app. Except for one crucial difference: While TimeHop simply served up screenshots of your old posts, On This Day actually linked to them, which meant you could engage directly with your past. TimeHop hands you a history book, but On This Day offers you a time machine. It’s the Doc Brown to your Marty McFly, and in January I took my first spin in the DeLorean.
I spent the trip in a depressive tailspin, but On This Day reminded me I publicly classified the weekend as a series of picaresque escapades. I felt the need, as a now-older woman, to call out young Natalie and force her to confront the truth. “natalie,” I comment, “it’s not really an ‘adventure’ to see a college production of ‘passion’ and weep over how much u relate to fosca for >48hrs.”
After that, it was off to the races — 18-year-old Natalie spent winter into spring going through it, and I offered advice and admonishment that I knew would fall on deaf ears. (The only time my futility truly bothered me? A wall post that young Natalie ignored from a theater-camp friend who is now in Hamilton. I. KNOW.)
Sometimes you find yourself confronting questions about your gadgets that are so basic you don’t want to consult your IT guy, your manual, or your niece. That’s why we’re here. This week, in basic answers to basic questions: how to get a better Wi-Fi signal around your house.
The truth is that most routers are, in fact, bad gadgets that generally fail to adequately perform in one of several ways. One of the most common failures is their inability to cover an entire house in a decent signal. There are reasons for this, and solutions (some better than others, to be honest), but the router itself isn’t going to be much help in diagnosing or fixing those problems.
There is perhaps no gadget more vital and, at the same time, more completely incomprehensible than a wireless router. Companies ranging from giants like Apple (the AirPort line, $99–199) and Google (the OnHub, $178) to startups like Eero are doing their best to simplify them, but the basic facts remain: A router is a device in which even the most basic of settings and options are wildly unintuitive and mostly ignored because of that. If you know the difference between a 2.4GHz and 5GHz band, you’re probably paid for your tech expertise in some way. And that’s not an obscure setting; that’s as basic an element of a router as a megapixel count on a camera.
Once you have your router, the most important thing you can do for a good signal is place it smartly. So! A Wi-Fi router works by taking a wired internet connection and spitting out radio waves, which your computer or phone or Roku snags from the air and turns into websites and Snapchat Stories and episodes of Chef’s Table on Netflix. Some routers are built right into the modem you get from Verizon or Time Warner or Comcast or whichever; others you can buy yourself. (The ones you buy yourself are usually better, but your cable provider will not usually be very helpful in getting them to work right. After all, they didn’t make the router.)
That means that you should try, as best you’re able, to place your router in the center of your house, preferably not in a closet somewhere (though the general ugliness of routers would suggest that they are best stashed away out of sight). On a high shelf is good. Mounted on a wall is good, too, although not very pretty. But placing a router in the precise center of your home is not always possible! Sometimes, especially for renters, a router kind of has to stay near the modem, which is often tucked away in some back bedroom.
Routers, as mostly crappy gadgets, are confounded by objects and situations that 100 percent of routers will find themselves encountering. For example: walls. Wi-Fi waves can technically pass through walls, but some do so better than others: Any especially thick wall or any wall with metal in it (like foil-wrapped insulation metal-mesh lathing) is likely to slaughter your Wi-Fi strength.
Distance is also a problem. How far a router can spit out a signal is decided by its antennae, and varies router to router, but all routers have a limit, and the farther you get from the router, the slower and less reliable your connection will be. Routers also don’t usually offer much, if any, control over the direction in which they spit out their radio signals: Wi-Fi usually emerges from a router in a sort of dome of connectivity, with the router at the center. Stay within the dome’s boundaries, and you’ll have service, and get closer to the router and you’ll have better service.
The first stupidly obtuse concept we have to talk about here is “frequency bands.” Any Wi-Fi–using device you’re likely to have supports either the 2.4GHz or the 5GHz frequency band. Or both; most nice smartphones and computers will support both. Two-point-four GHz is a little older; more devices support it, and its range is very good. Five GHz is newer, and a lot faster, but not everything supports it, and you usually have to be physically closer to the router. This is all you need to know about frequency bands.
A good thing to look for when buying a router is that the gaudy, stupid box has “dual-band” written on it somewhere. That means that this router will actually be spitting out at least two separate Wi-Fi networks, one 2.4GHz and one 5GHz. They’ll be two totally different things, with different names and different passwords. This is a good, if clumsy, option: If you’re near the router, you can jump on the 5GHz network and enjoy nice speeds. If you’re far away, you can jump on the 2.4GHz network — not quite as fast, but usually fast enough.
For most people, especially those who live in small houses or apartments, getting a popular dual-band router, like the TP-Link C5 AC1200 ($56.99, Amazon), or the more expensive and more powerful TP-Link Archer C7 ($99.95, Amazon) is probably enough — unless you’re setting up a very complicated network, you don’t need anything fancier or more expensive.
If you live in a larger home, you may still have trouble. Routers are usually very bad at broadcasting signals vertically; if you have a multi-story house, you’re probably going to have some issues. In this case, your options, to be honest, stink. You can opt for a Wi-Fi extender, sometimes called a repeater, which is supposed to be placed near the edge of your signal dome and duplicates your existing connection. They are easy to set up, at least by router standards, but will decrease the speed of your entire connection dramatically. Amazon’s best seller is this ugly Netgear thing ($30), but they can get much more expensive; venerable tech blog Tom’s Guide recommends this $149 monstrosity.
If you have a lot of money, and nothing else is working, the reviews of the Eero are extremely good. Eero is a “mesh networking” router, which is a term that you really, really do not need to understand. Basically it is a normal router, but you can buy multiple Eeros and place them around your house and they’ll just naturally work together and spread out Wi-Fi without loss in speed and without the need for you to switch networks. Eero costs a lot of money: $200 for one, which, well, there’s absolutely no reason to ever just buy one of these things, so the more important price is $350 for two or $500 for three. That said, if you’re starting from scratch, and know you’ll have Wi-Fi problems? It’s not really that much more expensive than any of these other solutions, and is certainly easier.
Another option that nerds love is called a “powerline” adapter. These are uniformly ugly beige boxes that you plug into your wall’s outlet. You’ll need at least two: One of them is connected by Ethernet cable to your router before being plugged into the wall, and the other(s) can be anywhere in your house. These things run data along the actual electrical lines of your house, which is kind of cool in a Brazil sort of way, and you end up with very little loss in speed or reliability at the other end. But here’s the thing: At that other end, where you didn’t have Wi-Fi before? Well, you still don’t, because the good powerline adapters only provide an Ethernet port. So you can plug a single computer in. Or if you actually want Wi-Fi in this side of the house, which is the whole point of this article, you can buy another router to plug into your stupid powerline adapter which is connected to another powerline adapter which is connected to your other router which is connected to your modem. Jesus Christ. Forget it. You might as well just surf the web on your phone.
And if you already have a router that works most of the time, you may want to stick with it — most $20 routers will do a good-enough job in a small space if they’re properly placed.
Earlier this week, Twitter announced on its blog that the company is now letting advertisers target ads to Twitter users based on the emoji they use on the platform. Think Domino’s ads for people who tweet pizza emoji, Budweiser, oh sorry I meant “America,” promos for folks tweeting steins of beer. You get the idea.
According to Twitter, more than 11o billion emoji have been tweeted since 2014. Which is fun for us Twitter users who are slowly losing the ability to read anything that isn’t a pictograph, but if you think about it, represents a largely untapped market for ad revenue. With this new feature, everybody wins! (Except for any Syracuse fans who tweeted a zillion of the orange emoji during March Madness and are probably going to be haunted by juice ads till the end of time.)
Advertisers will be able to target ads based on both the emoji a person has tweeted and tweets they’ve interacted with that contain emoji. (Really makes you think twice what you fav.) And brands will be able to “connect with people based on their expressed sentiment” and “target people who tweet food emojis,” the blog post furthered. Which is good news for anybody in the eggplant or crying-cat industries.
Combining the two loves of geeks everywhere — eccentric fashion and elaborate and ultimately pointless projects — Ryan Anderson built a robotic sorting hat that has both captivated his children and the many grown-up children talking about it online.
3-D printing is all the rage, and it’s being used for everything from automobiles to running shoes.
Anderson, an IBM engineer by trade, created the device at a hackathon back in October, but it’s making the rounds online again this week. He built it using a few of IBM Watson’s cognitive-computing programs, a Raspberry PI, Arduino Yun (microcontroller board), and several motors from DVD players. He also had some help from his daughter, Lucy, who helped establish 150 “ground truths,” or key terms the hat would recognize as central to any given Hogwarts house. (Wit for Ravenclaw, bravery for Gryffindor, jerk for Slytherin, and so forth). If you’re feeling particularly tech-savvy, you can find instructions to code your own here.
To use the hat, you place it on your head (though it’ll still work if you’re not wearing it), and tell it a few things about yourself. The hat will then process the information and shout out your newly declared house. (Of course, if you don’t have a snazzy robot to tell you, just do what the rest of us do. Ask your friends and act totally offended when they tell you you’re a Hufflepuff.)
The hat also works using information from a person’s Wikipedia page, placing Stephen Hawking and Hillary Clinton into Ravenclaw, while planting Donald Trump in Gryffindor (slightly concerned about that last one). But hey, the hat also uses deep learning, meaning it actually learns from its mistakes. Better luck next time, hat!
BuzzFeed asked three of the companies on whose board Thiel sits — Facebook, Palantir, and workplace-efficiency platform Asana — about his support for Donald Trump. They all said, well, nothing.
A few other things to know. Silicon Valley, generally speaking, is dependent on skilled engineers and developers who are often immigrants or the children of immigrants. It is why the tech sector has advocated for immigration reform in recent years. Donald Trump, throughout his campaign and particularly in the wake of the Orlando shooting, has advocated for preventing Muslim immigrants from entering the United States, as well as possible action against their natural-born-citizen children.
Here are some things to know about Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel is a famed tech-industry entrepreneur whose portfolio includes PayPal, Facebook, and the secretive data-mining company Palantir. Peter Thiel is also a delegate for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
Facebook’s own CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has previously alluded to disagreement with Trump’s xenophobic policies in public exactly once, but otherwise said nothing on the matter.
“Say nothing” is a general rule for tech companies, one that the largest and most successful — Apple and Amazon, in particular — have stuck by through controversies (and through regular business). It’s proven effective. Just a month ago, Facebook only amplified and worsened a story about bias in its trending-topics feature by talking too much, leading to, somehow, a congressional investigation. High-profile partisanship attracts all sorts of unwanted attention in Silicon Valley.
Which leads us to the other reason that Facebook isn’t going to talk about Peter Thiel’s support of Trump: because Peter Thiel supports Donald Trump. Facing a potentially damaging backlash from conservatives who believe, rightly or wrongly (but generally wrongly), that Facebook is suppressing the news and ideas they care about, it’s enormously helpful to have a Republican on the board. And not some Valley RINO, either: an actual Donald Trump delegate. In that sense, his politics, ridiculous as they are, do not preclude his ability to help the company, on whose board he sits, grow in value and influence. So Facebook will keep quiet, because addressing the Thiel elephant in the room will only make things worse.
Rumors of Snapchat’s smart-glasses project have been circulating for several years now. In 2014, the company quietly purchased Vergence Labs, a company that specializes in smart-glasses technology, for a reported $15 million. (News of the acquisition was leaked and not publicized by Snapchat.) Since then, they’ve slowly hired people away from major augmented-reality companies, but the project has remained shrouded in mystery and rainbow vomit. But apparently all we had to do was take a closer look at CEO Evan Spiegel’s face.
On a vacation in Corsica back in August 2015, Spiegel was photographed wearing a pair of black sunglasses that appear to have cameras attached to the lenses and frames. Earlier today Business Insider’s Biz Carson reported that a source close to Snapchat told her those glasses were, in fact, an “early prototype” of Snapchat’s smart glasses and they were “shocked” that Spiegel had worn them in public. Carson also notes that the glasses look similar to previous Vergence designs.
At this point, these photos of the alleged prototype are nearly a year old, so it’s likely the final product will look fairly different from the shades the CEO was rocking back then. So for future hints, let’s all continue to take grainy, long-range photos of Evan Spiegel, purely in the name of technology, of course.
It’s been six months since China’s repeal of the one-child policy went into effect. There’s just one problem for many couples looking to procreate: The country’s sperm banks are sorely lacking in donations. It’s an issue, the New York Times reported earlier this week, that the country only anticipates getting bigger as more and more couples start having second children.
Three years ago, newly minted CEO Marissa Mayer spearheaded Yahoo’s purchase of blogging platform Tumblr for more than $1 billion. The valuation seemed high, especially considering that Tumblr was not bringing in a lot of revenue. It certainly wasn’t profitable. According to a thorough account of the ensuing slow-motion car crash from Mashable, Mayer’s mishandling of the site stemmed from being too hands-off and then too hands-on.
Tumblr under Yahoo should have been a slam dunk. Tumblr brought in hip, web-savvy millennial users who dictated a substantial proportion of the trending web, and Yahoo — whose average user resembles the Crypt Keeper — would use its ad-sales resources to bring Tumblr to profitability. Easy peasy.
In overcorrecting, Mayer shifted most of the ad-sales operation in-house, handing the role to people less familiar with the platform’s intricacies and alienating Tumblr’s own team. In the aftermath, many left the company. One source told Mashable that the $100 million goal had actually seemed in reach before the handoff.
Except it wasn’t easy peasy. According to Mashable, Tumblr’s $100 million sales goal in 2015, a high target announced publicly by Mayer, “was Marissa just picking a number” out of thin air.
The hands-off approach, similar to how Google initially managed YouTube after its acquisition, proved to be a problem. Tumblr was located on the East Coast and Yahoo on the West, and while they partnered on a few initiatives, the two cultures clashed (one suspect anecdote claims that younger Tumblr employees didn’t even know what Yahoo was before the acquisition).
Tumblr is now reportedly back in charge of its own sales operation. The so-called “lost year” of 2015 would be brutal in any regard, but it’s even more precarious now that Yahoo is on the auction block. Some employees have hope that the company will become independent again. At the very least, it might receive stronger corporate parentage than Mayer provided.
While it might seem contradictory that a nation with a culture that has long preferred sons over daughters would run into this issue, a 2011 study notes that roughly half of all Chinese sperm donors are turned away for STDs or low sperm counts. With that in mind, the government is on a mission to bring in new men, between 20 and 45, as donors.
To do this, the country is relying on a few different methods, including ads promoting sperm donation with a charmingly patriotic spin, “Help mitigate the country’s aging problem.” Or alternatively, some sperm banks are offering cash (up to $1,000) or a rose-gold iPhone. Though at this point, it might just be worth holding out to see if Apple does roll out a dark-blue phone next fall. (China’s aging issue has been building for decades; what’s a few more months.)
From Mashable:
In the wake of the attack on Pulse gay club in Orlando, which claimed 49 lives last weekend, some politicians (mainly those who are also backed by the NRA) responded with an all-too-familiar rhetoric by offering thoughts and prayers to all those affected by the event: Thoughts and prayers. Then more thoughts and prayers. And then even more thinking and praying.
And while thoughts and prayers are fine if you’re into that sort of thing, they do absolutely nothing to change gun-control policy so that events like the shooting at Pulse do not happen again. (And again. And again.) It’s a point political-game website GOP Arcade is making with its newest game, Thoughts and Prayers. Users play the game by pressing the “T” and “P” keys on their keyboards. Each keystroke represents one thought or prayer, while a map of the United States shows victim counts from shootings across the country.
Players get 30 seconds, at the end of which they are shown how many thoughts and prayers they were able to send off in half a minute and how many lives they saved. When I played, I scored 116 and 0 respectively. Which, coincidentally, is the exact same number of lives that have been saved by politicians and people offering thoughts and prayers as a solution to gun violence in lieu of voting for stricter laws on background checks or reaching out to their elected officials.
On Friday, the New York State Assembly made it just slightly more difficult for ticket scalpers to hoover up tickets the minute they go on sale, a perpetual nuisance that has plagued anyone who has ever tried to get a ticket to Madison Square Garden.
According to a press release from Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie:
The New York State Senate has already passed a similar measure, leaving Governor Cuomo to sign the new regulations into law.
Ticket bots have become such a problem that state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman commissioned a report on the issue, revealing widespread bot usage. In 2013, a single bot bought 520 Beyoncé tickets in three minutes, presumably flipping them at a much higher resale value. Another bot bought more than 1,000 U2 tickets in less than a minute, likely because it lacked the artificial intelligence and machine-learning capabilities to understand that U2 sucks.
Just this past month, Hamilton maestro Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote an op-ed for the New York Times calling out bot problem, writing that, “You shouldn’t have to fight robots just to see something you love.” Though honestly, that seems like a pretty good alternative to paying $2,500 for a ticket to some rapping presidents.
Earlier this month, the artist now formerly known as the Tribune Publishing Company rebranded itself as “tronc.” While the makeover entertained Twitter for a solid two hours (“tronc if you’re horny”), it also distracted from the fact that Tronc’s new strategy — which included moving its stock exchange listing to Nasdaq and launching troncX, a “content curation and monetization engine” — was underexplained, at best.
This morning, Tronc’s rebrand became official. To celebrate, the company sent an informational video to all of its employees. Great, you might be thinking. An HR-distributed video featuring two executives will clear up all of my burning questions about Tronc. Surprisingly, however, the new clip, which features Tronc execs Malcolm CasSelle and Anne Vasquez, doesn’t exactly spell things out very clearly. So instead, we at Select All have created this handy translation as to what in the ever-loving tronc they are talking about and what that means for you.
“This is the future of journalism. The future of content. If you care about media and technology this is the place to be.”
Translation: Tronc is cool and cutting-edge.
“It’s about meeting in the middle having a tech startup culture meet a legacy corporate culture and then evolving and changing and that’s really the fun part.”
“tronc stands for Tribune online content, and it also means pooling of resources.”
Translation: Tronc is more than just an ill-advised rebranding — it’s also an ill-advised reorganization.
Translation: Pretty sure this just means video. And when you’re done with that, even more video.
Translation: Lots of people are going to get laid off, but your office might get a a few bean-bag chairs.
“We have great titles and we produce tons of great content every single day. We’re really focused on how we deliver it to people in a way that they want to consume it more and more.”
Translation: We’re going to take content from each individual Tronc-owned outlet and syndicate it to other Tronc outlets. We’ll use the map from Star Fox to illustrate this because a video of one of the machines that makes chicken nuggets would be too gross.
“One of the key ways we’re going to harness the power of our journalism is to have a optimization group. This tronc team will work with all of the local markets to harness the power of our local journalism, feed it into a funnel and then optimize it so that we reach the biggest global audience possible.”
“The key to making our content really valuable to the broadest possible audience is to use machine learning to maximize all the time. Artificial intelligence is going to allow journalists to do their jobs more efficiently, finding the right photos the videos, the databases, the things you package your stories with.”
Translation: We’re going to replace many of the people who get laid off with “artificial intelligence,” which means those that remain will be asked to churn out more work in the same amount of time as they did in the years Bt (Before Tronc).
“Ultimately those efficiencies will help us produce more content, better content. That will make stories much more visual, much for exciting. Today, that is what people expect.”
“Right now, we’re averaging about 16% of our article pages have the type of video player that we can monetize. By 2017 we need to get to 50% of our article pages have a Brightcove video player attached to it.”
Translation: Waayyyyy more video.
“The CPM [cost per impression] that we can earn with a video or visualized content is significantly higher than a page without it, and that’s the reason why we have to raise these numbers. It will significantly increase our annual revenue per user. ”
Translation: We can make a lot more money from video ads than from regular display ads, so we’re going to add video to everything.
“We’re a content company, first, last, and always. The role of tronc is to transform journalism, from pixels to Pulitzers.”
Translation: We’re going to make more video.
Translation: Tronc is a the future of media. Tronc transcends time, space, and page-view metrics. If you want to win a Pulitzer, you should probably continue working at Tronc.

An AI robot named Benjamin wrote a film called Sunspring with the help of director Oscar Sharp and AI researcher Ross Goodwin, and the results are pretty bizarre.
If you want to watch the full nine-minute film, it’s available on YouTube, or, if you’re just interested in learning how it all came to fruition, a profile was written detailing the entire production.
Earlier this month, I Sea, a new app which claimed to let users scan satellite images of the Mediterranean Sea looking for refugees in need of rescue, was hailed as a smart convergence of tech and social justice that just might save lives. The app shows users a small section of water embedded with geographic coordinates. If someone thinks they spot a refugee in distress, they can flag the spot, and the Migrant Offshore Aid Station will be informed. (The app was created in a partnership between MOAS and Grey for Good, the charity arm of Grey Advertising.)
To learn more about the film’s creators, visit Benjamin.wtf, thereforefilms.com or rossgoodwin.com.
Live video, maybe you’ve heard of it. It’s one of the hottest things on the net right now. Facebook: “Live video.” Google: “Live YouTube.” Amazon: “Twitch.” Twitter: “Periscope.” Now Tumblr has also decided that live video is another great vector for its user base of deku scrub otherkin and sapiosexual lupine tweens to express itself.
There aren’t a whole lot of details, except that the service launches tomorrow and … that’s kinda it. Check out this GIF!
Another post on the blog teases a streaming schedule, appearing to coincide with other Tumblr promotional events such as their regular Q&A series Answer Time.
According to TechCrunch:
These are not, as should be apparent, publishing tools. It’s not clear whether users will also, or eventually, be able to broadcast live.
Who knows what’ll happen? We’ll find out tomorrow.
Imagine this question, submitted to a Tumblr user, in the former of a live video though.
But thanks to an investigation published today by the Daily Dot’s Patrick Howell O’Neill, it looks like I Sea isn’t all it claims to be. After the app was nominated for a Cannes Lion (think of the Oscars, but for advertising), people began getting suspicious of the app. The weather information on the app, the Daily Dot reports, comes from fake Libyan weather reports. And the so-called different sections of the Mediterranean appear to be the same section repeatedly reused and relabeled. (Not to mention the questionable fact that it is always daylight on the app.)
This Twitter user also pointed out that the sections seem to come from Google images circa 2015.
Even if you do “spot” a refugee in you “section” of the sea, when you try to flag it and report, the app requests several pieces of personal information, including passport number, with no explanation why that data is needed.
The Migrant Offshore Aid Station told the Daily Dot, “technology questions are not our area of expertise” and we’ve reached out to Grey and will update this post if we hear back. Either way the app has already been pulled from the app store, which doesn’t bode well for I Sea’s legitimacy.
In the least surprising move imaginable, Facebook shareholders voted today to keep billionaire tech titan Peter Thiel on the company’s board.
Well, really, it was Mark Zuckerberg’s decision, given that he holds more than 60 percent of the voting power when it comes to Facebook’s board. The company has multiple tiers of stock with different privileges granted to them. Earlier today, the company approved a proposal to create a new class of nonvoting shares.
In other words, until Thiel’s vendetta against media outlets he doesn’t like becomes a full-blown PR nightmare that actively threatens Facebook’s market position, he’s staying, and Facebook’s not going to talk about it.
Christine Jantz of NorthStar Asset Management, which holds a measly $5.4 million in common stock, expressed concern about the voting procedure, saying that, “It will continue to become impossible for outside shareholders to have any input on company decisions.” I mean, yeah, it’s 2016 and it’s still Zuckerberg’s world. Where have you been?
Apple may have made its disdain for Donald Trump known (sorry about that GOP-convention funding thing, Mr. Trump), but that doesn’t mean the tech giant wants to completely alienate itself from the Republican party. The company’s CEO will still be hosting a breakfast fundraiser for House Speaker Paul Ryan next week, Politico reports.
The event, which Apple’s treasurer Gary Wipfler is also hosting, will raise money toward supporting other Republican candidates in the upcoming election. Apple, as Politico also notes, does not have an official political action committee. So Cook is sponsoring this event independently of the company. (The Apple CEO has a personal history of donating to candidates from both parties.)
From a business perspective, it makes sense for Apple, since, Trump or no Trump, it never hurts the bottom line to curry favor in Washington. But it’s also a good reminder to Democrats that placing your political faith in a corporate institution is asking for disappointment.
Update: A Grey representative directed us to this company statement, which says the app is still in “testing mode,” and “during this testing period, the satellite images available are not in real-time.”
Guess the new algorithm didn’t scare anyone off: According to Instagram, the photo-sharing app now sees more than 300 million daily users. That’s a lot of rise-filtered pictures of feet.
While there is certainly some wiggle room given Snapchat’s somewhat-hazy figure, we’re willing to bet that Spiegel didn’t round down to the tune of 200 million people. (A Snapchat representative told Select All the 100 million figure remains the latest number that the company has publicly confirmed.)
If you’ve been reading the tech press (including Select All), it might come as a surprise that Instagram sees more users than Snapchat. Snapchat is hugely popular and now has more users than Twitter, in part because it’s riding a broader trend away from public-facing social networks, which suffer deeply from a phenomenon called “context collapse,” and toward more private and ephemeral sharing apps. But Instagram, though it’s public by default, tends more toward the limited-audience camp of social networks, thanks to its lack of in-app sharing tools. Plus, it’s a slightly older app with a slightly more intuitive user interface (it involves significantly less tapping and swiping and sliding to find your content).
Maybe more important, the figure indicates Instagram is seeing more users than teen-darling Snapchat, which founder Evan Spiegel said back in February total “more than 100 million.”
And, well, it depends on how you’re measuring popularity, anyway. Instagram says the app sees more than 95 million photos and videos posted each day, while Snapchat’s daily users are watching more than 10 billion videos per day. (Keep in mind that Snapchat counts you as one video view even if you only watch for a millisecond.) Which means, even though Instagram has more people engaging with its app every day, it’s likely daily user activity is significantly higher on Snapchat. This makes sense: As any good teen will tell you, you should include as many short videos as possible in your snap story, while Instagram has a pretty strict unwritten “one photo a day” rule. (Maybe twice if you’re somewhere particularly cool, like inside an active volcano or at a One Direction concert.)
This morning, Twitter announced several big changes. First, users will be able to post 140-second videos, instead of the previous limit of 30 seconds. And the company rolled out a new, stand-alone app called Twitter Engage. It’s available only on iOS devices and is designed to let users track their influence and, well, engage more personally with fans.
“Twitter Engage, a new companion app for Twitter, is available today and provides real-time data and insights, allowing you to quickly understand, engage, and grow your audiences,” the company explained in a blog post, as though the OG Twitter app had gotten lonely and needed a new pal.
While the extra 110 seconds of video coming to take over your feed is a big deal, even more significant is that Twitter also announced that certain publishers will be able to post videos up to ten minutes in length. “We’re investing heavily in videos and creators. We want to be the best place for creators and influencers to build an audience and make it easier for creators to make money on Twitter, and soon, Vine,” said Jack Dorsey of the new app, The Wall Street Journal reports. Which means Twitter, like Facebook, Snapchat, and Tronc, are joining the mad scramble for monetized video.
The new app does not have a newsfeed like regular Twitter. Instead, the app has three tabs: one to track analytics and tweet impressions over a period of time; another for a closer look at how people are interacting with your individual tweets; and a third to show your key interactions, like verified accounts and and users with whom you share a lot of followers. It’s available for anyone with an iPhone to download, but unless you actually have fans or a decent-sized following (you know who you are), the app is probably not for you. You can, though, also tweet directly from the Engage app, without having to read tweets from your ex, second cousin, or that great guy from your high school who still hasn’t quite figured out memes.
In April, BuzzFeed signed development deals with some of its most notable video stars in order to prevent them from getting lured away by higher-paying Hollywood entities. “When you look at the way we designed this program,” CEO Jonah Peretti said, “we were thinking about how to have a system where they can learn and get better, and they’re not having a difficult time making something and reaching an audience.” Peretti’s spoken frequently about the fact that his long-term vision for BuzzFeed is more along the lines of a golden-age movie studio rather than a newspaper or cable channel — an enormous media company with the power, creativity, and production values of Hollywood, leveraging the distribution mechanisms of Silicon Valley.
Teslas are expensive vehicles. Boats are expensive vehicles. But that is where the similarities end, and you really shouldn’t use the former as a double for the latter. Even if Elon Musk says the electric car will float “well enough.”
Musk’s tweet was in response to a story on Elektrek, which included a video of a man driving a Tesla S in Kazakhstan that appeared to be floating across some seriously flooded roads. Meanwhile, the traditional cars on the road don’t seem to be moving at all. (Please ignore the not-so-subtle use of “The Blue Danube” waltz that doesn’t at all scream “I am really hoping this video goes viral.”)
Of course, there are a few reasons Hollywood’s old studio system no longer exists. One is the existence of powerful unions that protect actors, writers, directors, and other entertainment-industry workers from being pressured or forced into disadvantageous contracts that relinquish power and control to the studios themselves. It’s hard not to hear echoes of this when Peretti says stuff like, “The thing that was surprising to me was when I started to interface with the entertainment industry is … there was this entire system set up to say no to people that want to make things.” Or when you read this internal memo, published on the company’s website Monday, indirectly addressing the abrupt dismissal last week of two well-known video stars from BuzzFeed Motion Pictures.
But it also shows the difficult road BFMP will have to travel if it really wants to compete against (and eventually replace) the established studios, labor groups, and business practices that dominate the movie business. BuzzFeed videos don’t have credits in the video or in their YouTube description, by design. In a way, it’s less like the Hollywood studios it wants to subsume and more like comics-industry juggernauts DC and Marvel, who often cut individual creators out of deals or minimize their effort, in exchange for a work environment that is by most other accounts fun and supportive.
The mere fact that BuzzFeed has to spell out the terms of its employment agreements signals a couple of things, perhaps chief among them that BuzzFeed’s effort to focus on hiring a young workforce straight out of college can have its downsides.
The employees had been fired for working on another series that wasn’t produced by BuzzFeed, and BFMP boss Ze Frank must have felt the need to explain to his extremely young workforce exactly how their contracts work. “This model requires different ways of thinking about employment and the creative process,” Frank wrote. “More concretely, it requires BuzzFeed to invest heavily in its producers and in the things that make them successful: the space and equipment you need to experiment, training processes and classes to help you develop.” (This benevolence on BuzzFeed’s part helps bolster the fastest-growing sector of a media company whose valuation was around $1.5 billion last year.)
In exchange for all of this support, Frank says, the company only requires two things: that BuzzFeed retains ownership of anything its employees develop and that they work for BuzzFeed exclusively. These are not outrageous requests in tech and media circles — in fact, they’re pretty standard. But film-industry workers tend to divide their time working on shorter-term projects and, depending on the project and contract, often retain significant rights over the end product. At BuzzFeed, stars who leave have found that the terms of the contract prevent them from controlling, for example, the public Facebook accounts set up in their names by BuzzFeed.
But the comics business — while by no means perfect — is a well-established industry with clear paths to success. The future of film is less sure, and it’s not clear what will happen to Buzzfeed’s stable of stars as they attempt to leverage YouTube stardom into long-term careers. It may just be that BuzzFeed’s blanket treatment of intellectual property, covering technical innovation and new creative franchises, isn’t going to work. Silicon Valley coders and engineers may generally accept that their work belongs to the company, but young actors, writers, and directors are much less likely to accept contract terms that their peers outside of BuzzFeed aren’t obligated to.
Of course, Los Angeles has always had businesses that rely on the rich dreams and poor contract-reading skills of young new arrivals. But as the first generation of BFMP YouTube stars start looking for the next step, it seems clear that BuzzFeed is going to have to figure out how to address their concerns.
Musk also explained on Twitter that the reason the car doesn’t short out (as anyone who has ever tried to drive through a particularly puddle-filled street can attest) is because the “drive units and batter are sealed” to keep water out. If you really want to take to the sea that badly, maybe just drop $70,000 on a boat instead.

Today, a truly wondrous event is taking place. With a single tweet, Good Morning America has simultaneously angered, created drama, and brought joy to different pockets of the internet, creating a nexus through which all of our desires, hopes, fears, insecurities, and dreams must travel.
Darby Risner is a 15-year-old from Alabama who was having a great time with her friends at a party this weekend when she spotted a giant Barney head (you know: the dinosaur). So she did what any good teen would do: She plunked Barney on her head.
The fervor that surrounded #TeaLizard was so immense, you might have thought something happened to a human being. The first wave: the anger.
Yes, that is Kermit the Frog. And yes, Kermit sipping tea is a popular meme, one used when you sassily point something out, and then slyly back away, claiming that it’s not the business of your instigating ass, which is just sipping tea — an action that prevents you from speaking, or something.
Anyway, in GMA’s tweet, the meme is referred to as “Tea Lizard.”
They called Kermit (The Frog) Tea (Lizard).
Then the drama.
And finally, the humor.
One reason this story is interesting is because it’s unclear who (if anyone) is at fault, who is mad, and who, as they say, is actually laughing. Is this another case of cultural appropriation by an out-of-touch organization? Is this a highly savvy troll? Is this GMA saving face by pretending it knew what it was doing? Is it true that #TeaLizard will, in fact, weaken the resolve of our allies?
These are fair questions, and to some degree, everyone has a case to make. But there’s something you need to reckon with, no matter your societal stance: the continued disrespect for the field of herpetology.
Kermit is a frog. A frog is an amphibian. A lizard is a reptile.
Word?
It’s just so insulting. Beyond a frog and a lizard both being clearly ectothermic, they couldn’t be any more different. Not all green things are the same, you ignorant bastards. This is what intersectionality means. If you see phylum, you also have to shed the rose-colored glasses and see class.
I can’t even fathom how you could look at a frog like Kermit and allow yourself to describe it as an animal that fertilizes internally.
It’s like calling the Geico mascot a toad. Which would be incorrect. Because it’s not a toad. It’s a gecko, which is obvious upon first sight because it defends itself with scales, not with toxic secretions from its skin.
So to all of you, in the trenches, fighting for the sanctity of the creative class, meme rights, and appropriation — I hear you, but maybe it’s time to look in the mirror and check your privilege. Sure, it’s your issue, but it’s also ours. Life’s not just all fun and games and trolls and memes and social justice; some of us #onhere have Chordata to worry about.
I am talking about Tea Lizard.
“I had originally worn the whole [Barney] costume to school in 7th grade and it fit perfectly then,” Darby told me via Twitter DM. “All the girls came down stairs as I attempted to scare them. We then all walked over to the couch and sat down. At that point, the head had moved its way down to my lower arms to about my elbow area.”
Darby says at first she felt fine, but that feeling went away quickly. “I thought to myself ‘I’ll be fine, I can get it off whenever.’ But after about 15 minutes had passed an[d] I was like ‘I need to get this off,’” she said. She tried to wriggle her way out and when that failed, Darby enlisted a few friends. That failed, too. The girls then clued in some of the parents at the party, who tried Vaseline to help slide the head off. (This also didn’t work, but the fireman would later describe her as “a greased pig.” Which is what every teenage girl hopes to hear.)
Realizing they weren’t going to get the dino off without some help, Darby and her friends headed to the fire station where “the firemen cut slits into the head; then they had finally got it to budge an[d] it came off.” Darby says she felt nothing but “relief” at being freed from her Cretaceous-period prison and recommends going immediately to a fire station if you ever find yourself similarly trapped in a giant Barney mask.
As for getting stuck, Darby says that the Barney incident was just the latest of a series of past incidents, including a bus bathroom and a baby swing. “I have been stuck in many things before and I may have learned my lesson, but maybe not lol,” she said. We’re guessing not, since Darby also told Select All she’s gunning to be her school’s mascot, which entails wearing a Husky costume: “I tried out to be the mascot for my school but I don’t know how well that will work out now 😂.”
😂.
Darby ended up stuck inside the dino head for nearly an hour, until the local fire department finally freed her.
For pop-star fandoms, “She doesn’t have the range” is a perfect musical neg to deploy against rival sects. Your fave is a good performer, maybe even great, but, well, she doesn’t have the range.
It’s been around for a while. But yesterday, a Beyoncé stan account (@KingBeyonceStan) undertook the kind of bravura run of tweets that will take “She doesn’t have the range” out of the world of fandom and British sketch shows and into the phrasing of Twitter normies everywhere.
“She doesn’t have the range” is a beautiful neg that comes from a Little Britain sketch parodying Tom Jones and Shirley Bassey. In it, Bassey discusses who has and who doesn’t have the range. “Sheryl Crow?” an interviewer asks. “She doesn’t have the range,” Bassey replies. “Paul McCartney?” “She doesn’t have the range.” “Shirley Bassey?” “She doesn’t have the range. I’m sorry, Shirley; I love her to bits, but she doesn’t have the range.” “But that’s you.” ” I don’t care. I don’t have the range.”
The phrase is already ascending into the upper tiers of memedom.
Parallel parking is the worst. (And I’m not just saying this because I failed my road test three times for hitting the curb.) To make sure he didn’t suffer the same fate, 18-year-old Matt booked himself regular lessons with a local driving instructor.
The British teen said his first instructor’s schedule was pretty crowded, so Matt was only able to take one lesson a week. “I got in touch with a second instructor for extra lessons to increase my chance of passing,” he said. Except when Matt texted his first instructor to let him know he’d be supplementing their lessons, the instructor didn’t take it super well.
“Well, we [Matt and the first instructor] hadn’t practiced maneuvers much at all, to be honest, and that was one reason I was worried about getting extra lessons as my slot was on Friday afternoon and the roads were constantly packed. From everything I have done, parallel parking has to be the hardest thing I’ve found whilst driving.” Same, Matt. And good luck!
And Facebook is pushing live video hard not simply because Facebook is looking to compete for television advertising money (though it is), but because Facebook itself is anxious about the future. People are sharing less about themselves, which slows Facebook’s growth and cuts at the heart of its most profitable product, the News Feed. Live — which, Mark Zuckerberg will tell you, is more authentic, off the cuff, spur of the moment — is one attempt to solve that problem.
It’s hard to blame digital publishers for chasing live video, and not just because Facebook is paying them. Ad buyers are more likely to cut deals for video advertisements, bringing in more revenue than sites might against “print” content. And, more to the point, live video is enormously popular: It’s seen, commented on, and shared by people at a scale that no other content on Facebook can really claim right now.
Facebook’s power is such that it can create and incentivize (and, if that doesn’t work, more or less literally force) a new form of News Feed content onto consumers in the span of a couple of months. But that speed and power also means that a lot of money is being invested, by Facebook and others, into a technology whose central question — “Why should this be live?” — hasn’t yet been adequately answered.
Or, put more specifically, it’s been answered on the business side, but not on the user side. One of the great consumer-friendly qualities of the internet is that it’s asynchronous. You can catch up with media consumption at your leisure. The current mode of live-video implementation flies in the face of this. Facebook and Twitter’s Periscope send push notifications alerting users to whenever someone they follow goes live. But this “drop everything” assumption is weighted toward the broadcaster, not viewer choice. “Chewbacca Mom,” for instance, is the most-watched Facebook Live video of all time. But that designation is misleading. It doesn’t mean that a record number of people watched this woman lose her shit in real time, it means that a record number watched it in its archival form on demand. At that point, the video is just … a standard upload.
Publishers make it worse by trying to mimic the traditional television formats that came before them. Two talking heads arguing about the news; Martha Stewart giving a cooking tutorial. But these formats don’t work, and they certainly don’t get users invested. Traditional appointment viewing of “shows” flies in the face of what works online. The ability to tune in at any point and understand what’s happening is essential to the success of live internet video — not tuning in the moment someone goes live. It’s why that watermelon livestream was such a hit, and it’s the core component of video-game-streaming services, like Twitch, that are so successful. On YouNow, a popular premise is watching teenagers sleep. Live video on the web doesn’t need to be flashy, and it certainly shouldn’t mimic older formats. Counterintuitively, it needs to be boring and slow.
As long as Facebook pays them, media companies will keep creating live video, and as long as Facebook keeps pushing live video, so will its smaller rivals. But “because of Facebook” has never been a good answer to “why” questions in digital publishing, and unless publishers start thinking about what live video is actually for, and what its strengths are, it’s just going to be another expensive trend.
In the beginning there was the Nerd, and the Nerd was God …
Three decades before HBO’s Silicon Valley satirized geeks and their dreams of fortune-building, world-saving technology, there was St. $ilicon, the prophet and sole apostle of C.H.I.P., the Church of Heuristic Information Processing. Created in 1985 in a burst of inspiration by Jeffrey Armstrong, a street poet, religious scholar, and onetime celibate monk turned tech executive and comedian, St. $ilicon was once as ubiquitous among computer enthusiasts as eight-inch floppy disks. Today, he’s nearly as obscure.
At the height of his renown, Armstrong donned vestments, glued a microchip to his forehead (“in the third 1/0”) and presented St. $ilicon’s pun-filled “DOSpels” to crowds numbering in the thousands at COMDEX in Las Vegas. Armstrong would end his sermons by saying, “Remember folks, if everyone lit just one cursor, what a bright world this would be.” Back then, he was fond of calling himself “the world’s first high-tech computer comedian — except IBM.”
Geeks the world over ate up St. $ilicon’s shtick like so much astronaut ice cream, sending Armstrong letters by the boxful. Armstrong was profiled by The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and the New York Times and photographed in all his beatitude. He was paid thousands of dollars to perform at corporate gigs for companies like Apple, IBM, and Hewlett-Packard, where he preached the word of the G.O.D. (a.k.a., the Giver of Data). He met everyone from Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs to Bill Gates.
Then, just as computers moved into every home (and later every pocket and onto many wrists) and their creators attained godlike status, a funny thing happened to St. $ilicon. The founder of the world’s first tech religion, and his avatar, Jeffrey Armstrong, disappeared.
“Bringing this back is really messing with the matrix,” Armstrong says.
In 1987, he told a reporter from the Associated Press, “I would like to think that I help heal the wound created by excessive technology.” Today, we are all the walking wounded, adhering to the notifications of our phones more closely than our own vital signs. And while there are tech critics of all sorts, from VR pioneer Jaron Lanier to the Digital Detox’s Levi Felix, few are addressing it with the lightness of touch found in The Binary Bible or St. $ilicon’s sermons to his “DOSciples.”
Here’s what Armstrong sees when he surveys the current tech landscape:
Facebook: “In-Your-Facebook is what I like to call it.”
Apple Watch: “The fact that Apple of all people has made a wristwatch so that drones can find you is not the Apple Computers I worked for, let me put it that way.”
For now, St. $ilicon lives in boxes, where Armstrong has saved “a couple hundred hours of audio and video” of his performances and interviews. He says he has 300 letters to St. $ilicon (as well as his responses). “I lost interest and everyone was self-interested. At a certain point it just stopped.”
Amen.

When it came to using the internet to connect with friends or family throughout the day, the gap widened slightly, but still not by much. Only 20 percent of people in rules offices said they engaged in this activity, while that number bumped to 35 percent for people at more lax offices. And there was a 9-percent gap (16 percent to 25 percent) between those groups regarding using the web to answer work-related questions.
Most interesting is that while you might expect the results from workers where social media is tolerated to be significantly higher, on the whole, they are still fairly close to the numbers from the other group. Which means, bosses in offices restricting social use probably have less to worry about than they think in terms of productivity. It’s still a minority of people in the more-chill offices using social media during the workday. Even though they technically can, those offices don’t appear to be staffed by social zombies staring at their Facebook newsfeed all day. (Maybe because they understand, you know, they have to do work at their jobs?) Anyway, what we’re saying is, employers, let your employees eat cake and Instagram it, too. Your productivity probably won’t suffer. And also, you’ll have cake.
But one thing will remain on the internet eternally, from now until the end of time, when the sea swallows us whole and drags us into the murky dark. In a rapidly accelerating society, it is fitting that one of the internet’s original pillars is a creature dedicated to speed and ferocity, unceasing momentum as we push toward an uncertain future.
Alluding to Sonic in your screenname or avatar spoke volumes: “I’m not perfect, but I’m authentic. Through this blue anime hedgehog, I am conveying my humanity.”
Original characters illustrated in the Sonic style, many created as Mary Sues, are likewise ubiquitous online. Newgrounds even has a Sonic OC creator for you to use. There is also a fun impromptu social-media game in which you type “[your name] the hedgehog” into Google Image Search and post the first result.
Along the way, the Sonic franchise became bogged down with an awful supporting cast. In addition to Tails, Knuckles, and the series’s main villain, Doctor Eggman, there was now Amy Rose (pink hedgehog, Sonic girlfriend); Shadow (like Sonic, but more pop-punk than Gen X; he has a gun); Silver (hedgehog from the future with psychic powers;, and a whole host of other anthropomorphic travesties. They are cartoons, so they appealed to children regardless, but they are also objectively garbage.
A fan’s love for Sonic throughout his ‘90s heyday makes sense, but as the franchise expanded into the new millennium, game quality started to decline rapidly. Whereas the Super Mario games had made a seamless transition into the third dimension in Super Mario 64, Sonic struggled to do the same. The mix of precision platforming and uncontrollable momentum, which worked along a two-dimensional plane, did not transition well to 3-D space. The games Sonic Adventure and its sequel for the ahead-of-its-time flop, the Sega Dreamcast, were well-regarded, but subsequent iterations like Sonic Heroes and the spinoff Shadow the Hedgehog were more dubious affairs, earning Metacritic averages around 70 and 50 percent, respectively.
As Levi Buchanan wrote for IGN in 2009:
In 2007, evaluating a preview build of what would later become Sonic and the Secret Rings, Gamespot wrote, “Based on what we played, Sonic Wild Fire is shaping up to be a shiny showcase for the Wii … the visuals offer a striking assortment of eye candy that places the game among the best-looking games we’ve seen for the system.” It holds a score of 69 on Metacritic. Good, not great. In 2008, Sega tried again with Sonic Unleashed, getting decent preview buzz but releasing a similarly mediocre game.
This pattern — prerelease hype dashed against the rocks of reality — is now self-sustaining, mostly due to the fact that Sonic fans hold the Genesis games to unattainably high standards (go back and play them; they probably don’t hold up as well as you think). And because of this never-ending cycle, Sonic on the internet is constantly debated, and therefore constantly present. Fans have been buzzing about the Next Great Sonic Game for as long as people have been fighting for a second season of Firefly.
Genuine Sonic fandom can then give way to zealot-like defensiveness, an unwillingness to admit that Sonic is past his prime. Many older Sonic fans are in this stage, nostalgic for the past and hopeful for the future. They believe that one day, Sonic will return in all his glory and their years of suffering will have been worth the wait. Sega positioned Sonic as an underdog in the ‘90s as a marketing ploy, but now he is stuck as an underdog forever. That makes liking Sonic the sort of counterintuitive, unconventional opinion that people enjoy vocalizing online — the contrarian mode that sites like Slate have ridden for years. The internet is a place where, for the last two decades, you could log on and say “I like Sonic” and it would be slightly risqué. People love to believe that they are unique flowers, and liking Sonic is, somehow, one of the easiest ways to convey this sense. To be a fan of Sonic nowadays is to be a part of a special club of true believers.
And that fandom can manifest itself in odd ways online, because the internet has by and large been a safe space for fans to go deep on their hobby. One of the most uncomfortable works, and a personal fascination of mine, is Guptill89’s infamous video, Top Ten Hottest Female Sonic Characters.
It describes Sonic thusly:
Sonic is the perfect storm that happens when millennial nostalgia for the Clinton era and the web’s uniquely militant brand of defensiveness combine, along with the ever-present need that adolescents feel to distinguish themselves in some way.
There is not a line in this entire eight minutes that isn’t gold.
As memes have reached greater sophistication and a broader audience, irony has crept in, and the lines between genuine fandom and ironic fandom are unclear. I, for instance, was a genuine fan of Sonic, who now engages with the franchise ironically. In many ways, it traces the same path as that of the Shrek films: a strong primary installment, followed by lackluster and then flat-out terrible sequels. To joke about Sonic and the uniquely meme-centric culture surrounding it now is to also acknowledge that you once enjoyed the very thing you now mock. “I liked this once, and now it sucks, and that’s funny.”
The slashfic portion of Sonic gets weird. You might think that a running role play in which Sonic is pregnant with Shadow’s baby is an absurd escalation, but whoever runs the Tumblr called Ask Mpreg Sonic does not.
There is, for instance, the raging and perpetual debate surrounding Sonic and Tails. Do Sonic and Tails kiss? One vocal side is adamant: Sonic and Tails do not kiss. The other side is equally adamant: Sonic and Tails kiss all the time. It points to a rift in the Sonic community. On one side, some declare that the official Sonic canon is the only thing that matters. On the other side, devoted fanfiction authors live out their dreams of a speedy hedgehog and a two-tailed flying fox getting rowdy on each other’s mouths. Both sides are — and I say this with love — equally nuts in there commitment.
One infamous ironic Sonic OC is Coldsteel the Hedgeheg [sic], a parody of the in-your-face, Doritos-munching Mountain Dew-debro that Sonic holds genuine appeal with.
Four years ago, the blog Dumb Running Sonic began accumulating dozens of bespoke animated GIFs, celebrating Sonic’s need for speed while also ridiculing it. To be a Sonic fan nowadays requires the ability to roast your heroes after placing them on a pedestal.
Even Sonic’s official social-media brand now acknowledges this, giving winking approval to the fact that the edgy posturing of the ‘90s must at some point give way to a post-ironic stance.
On the internet, you’re competing for attention with billions of other people. So long as Sega keeps releasing dogshit-terrible Sonic games, trying to recapture his former glory, people will see themselves in Sonic — so close to glory and yet so far. And they’ll keep writing fanfiction, and drawing original characters, and using Sonic characters as their avatar. The imagery is loaded with layers of signification. Sonic is a cipher, who came of age alongside his most devoted fans in the early days of the web. And that’s why he’ll be around forever.
Enter paint-mixing: the cheapest form of digital therapy you never knew you needed. The concept is simple and the videos are short. Artists film their pallettes as they combine different hues with painter’s knives. That’s it. It’s amazing. The effect is both calming, enthralling, and is the closest I’ve ever gotten to understanding why people are fascinated with lava lamps. (Oh right, drugs.)
The videos have been around on Instagram for some time now, often under the hashtag #paintmixing, and are also a hit the internet’s home for all things rainbow, strange, and still living at home: Tumblr. To find out more, I reached out to two artists, Kirsten Hatfield and Sára J. Molčan, who, in addition to their, you know, “real” art, have made names for themselves as paint mixers. (Which is an art in and of itself, really.)
Hatfield and Molčan are both Vancouver-based artists. (They are also friends, something I didn’t know before I reached out to them. Apparently, the Canadian paint-mixing community is tightly knit. Or painted, as it were.) Molčan’s work includes “colorful abstracted psychological portraits,” while Hatfield is focused on “large-scale abstract paintings.” Both have cultivated decent Instagram followings for both their paintings and their pallette work. (Hatfied has 6,000 followers, but says she only recently started posting paint-mixing clips, after she was inspired by Molčan. Molčan has over 50,000.)
Molčan describes her paint-mix-video style as “up close and personal” and says the videos “took off” this spring and have only grown from there. “My videos became fairly popular right away, and soon many were being reposted by other Instagram accounts and other social-media platforms,” Hatfield echoed.
Unlike standard comments on the net, “most of the feedback I have gotten on the videos has been positive. I have had viewers say it helps them calm down when they have anxiety, or that it looks delicious,” Hatfield says. “Many people comment that when they first saw the thumbnail they thought it was food.” (If you think brightly colored paint looks like food, please stop reading listicles and eat something green. Not Day-Glo green. Just green.) “There are also people who enjoy it from a therapeutic standpoint, to ease anxiety or uplift them from depression,” Molčan told me. “Of course, there’s also some questionable and uncomfortable sexual comments from time to time. I find those ones bewildering.”
“Some people say it’s satisfying to watch the paint mix together,” Molčan also explains. “Others are transfixed by the calming reaction they feel. There’s also a lot of commentary regarding autonomous sensory meridian response.” (In case you’re not familiar, ASMR is a phenomenon where the body produces a physical reaction, like shivers or tingles, after watching or hearing a video, like someone speaking in a hushed tone or a mesmerizing video of paint.)
“The only negative feedback I have gotten is from people assuming I’m wasting paint,” Hatfield says. Which is just wrong, because the two women film their mixing videos before using the paint for larger projects. Think of it as a two-for-one art deal, with the added bonus of some extra mental chill.
At an event last night, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg disclosed that the company will now train employees on how to manage political bias.
“We have a managing-bias class that all of our leaders and a lot of our employees have taken that I was part of helping to create,” Sandberg said, according to The Hill, “and we’ve focused on racial bias, age bias, gender bias, national bias, and we’re going to add in a scenario now on political bias.” The training is reportedly mandatory for all employees.
The news comes just a few weeks after Gizmodo reported that former editorial contractors for the company, in charge of the site’s Trending Topics, had suppressed conservative news (Sandberg was speaking at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank). That minor scandal resulted in a change to how that process works, a rare public disclosure of how that process works, and a grandstanding congressional inquiry that will go nowhere.
The training is important because — as Facebook tells it and as is often the case with accusations of bias, conservative stories were not spiked because someone made an explicit decision — but because they just might not have seemed important enough to whomever was making the call. On the flip side, combatting political bias could theoretically mean designating shaky sites like Breitbart as reliable sources and keeping otherwise finished controversies like Benghazi floating around.
Select All would like to formally wish Roberto Martinez the happiest of 100th birthdays. We would also like to congratulate the family friend who gifted Martinez with the perfect present to celebrate his century on Earth: a shirt covered in “100” emoji. (That’s this one: 💯.)
Karmina Camara, a 20-yeard-old student from Miami and one of Martinez’s great-granddaughters, told Select All a little bit more about him. “My great grandpa was born in Cuba and came when he was 85,” she told me via Twitter DM. “He plays dominoes everyday.” (This is also my plan if I make it to 100.) Her cousin tweeted pictures of Martinez wearing the shirt, which have been liked and retweeted to the tune of 100,000 times since June 19.
Camara also told me they have filled Martinez in on his newfound viral status and “he’s really happy about it.” “He understands that it [the 100 emoji] means he’s 100. And it’s actually very fitting. He’s a really healthy guy. He doesn’t need glasses, has better memory than me, and is a very happy guy,” she said.
So while her great-grandfather gets the emoji in the literal I am 100-years-old sense, he doesn’t seem to quite grasp the finer nuances of the emoji as anything more than a substitute for typing a 1 followed by two zeros. (The 💯 is often a stand-in for happiness, excitement, or how much back rent you owe your roommates.) But we’ll give Martinez a break. He is 💯 after all.
On Thursday, Boston Dynamics released a demo video of it newest robot, the SpotMini. The robot — part dog, part dinosaur, part terminator — is a follow-up to the company’s earlier model, Spot. The newer edition, as its name implies, is smaller than its forebeast, weighing in at 65 pounds and with a battery that lasts an hour and a half before it runs out of juice. It’s got a number of interesting features, but it’s also somewhat, um, terrifying to watch. (Wall-E did not prepare me for the scary robots.)
The dog/giraffe/dinosaur robot is programmed to load a dishwasher, move trash from the kitchen counter to a bin, and can deftly wander your house. It can also be programmed to bring you a specific object. SpotMini understands how to get back up after a fall, as shown in the demo, when the robot recovers from a cartoonesque slip on several banana peels. (Though, if your home frequently has rogue banana peels lying around, you probably need a robot that is programmed to pick those up before slipping on them.)
Maybe the next Spot edition will be able to to turn my television on anytime a Kardashian graces the screen. Or break free from its lab and go on a joyride like this little guy in Russia. Or even resemble a dog. Only time, and Google, will tell.
Ever since it became clear that Donald Trump was a serious threat to win the Republican presidential nomination, people have pointed out that the man doesn’t seem to hold solid, ideologically grounded positions in the way most politicians do. Many politicians flip-flop and present a massaged version of themselves in national elections, of course, but in Trump’s case there doesn’t appear to be much there there. He speaks in the language of resentment — his platform is simply Screw you, elites and Screw you, immigrants, screamed over and over at a deafening volume.
But all is not well at r/The_Donald. Earlier this week, the moderator most responsible for launching the subreddit to its current lofty perch, CisWhiteMaelstrom (known more recently as Dylan-W), was removed from his position by the subreddit’s own mods, according to a post from those mods that went up late Tuesday. His story offers a tidy online microcosm of the Trump phenomenon itself, of the question of what it means to perform outrage online and how the act of doing so can be used for selfish and manipulative purposes.
Much the same can be said about his most dedicated online followers. They are obsessed with fighting social-justice warriors, with breaking what they see as the chafing constrictions of “political correctness.” It’s a formula that works: People can’t get enough of arguments about who is offending whom, whether people are too outraged, whether people are too outraged over other people’s outrage, and so on.
To explain why Cis, as he is known (few people know who he is in real life), was ousted from r/The_Donald, let’s just kick it to the mod who posted the announcement, TehDonald. As he wrote in his post, two things in particular “forced” the decision:
For these and other reasons, the Donald Trump subreddit, r/The_Donald, has become one of the largest, most active and most influential places for Trump fans to gather, to the point where it has garnered major media attention, hosted AMAs with alt-right heroes like Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter, and, naturally, pissed off hordes of progressives with its denizens’ over-the-top antics.
There’s a lot of interesting stuff to unpack here, some of which dovetails with problems the real-life Trump campaign has, but it’s worth quickly introducing Cis and explaining why he’s important.
It turned out that this was a fairly brilliant way to exploit Reddit’s thirst for outrage content: “A favorite tactic was to direct Trump fans to push deliberately dumb or offensive posts to the front page of Reddit and then laugh at the backlash when users took them seriously,” wrote Sarlin. “Sanders, and his legion of earnest Reddit fans, became one favorite target as r/The_Donald relentlessly promoted posts mocking the senator’s debate comment that white voters ‘don’t know what it’s like to be poor,’ to name one of Cis’ favorite examples.”
On the one hand, the constant outrage of earnest progressives helped promote r/The_Donald’s content; on the other, it attracted new subscribers to the subreddit because they saw it as a place where they could stick it to SJWs while embracing their memeiest selfs. Much like the Trump campaign itself, in other words, The_Donald, under Cis’s influence, was more about “Telling it like it is” — whatever that means — and offending liberal sensibilities than about forwarding an actual agenda. (I tried repeatedly to get in touch with Cis. Midday yesterday he left me a voice-mail from a “restricted” number, but, since then, multiple attempts to contact him through TehDonald and by messaging him at his alternate Reddit account have failed.)
Cis became a larger-than-life figure on this corner of Reddit thanks to his role in lifting r/The_Donald to its current status as a popular, influential subreddit that, much to the chagrin of a large chunk of Reddit, has regularly gotten its Donald-centric content onto the front page of the main site. MSNBC’s Benjy Sarlin explained how Cis pulled this off in a solid rundown of The_Donald from April. As Sarlin reported, the whole thing started early this year, when Cis emailed the site’s mods with a “master plan” to boost its growth and visibility. That plan, it turned out, mostly involved pissing off progressives by putting a premium on dumb, offensive content (though not too offensive — Cis “banned white supremacist and neo-Nazi users from r/The_Donald early on”).
And Cis took the politics-without-politics ethos pretty seriously. As Sarlin reported, he “deliberately avoids turning the subreddit into a hub for volunteers, out of fear that nuts-and-bolts discussions of phone banking would water down its appeal as an Internet funhouse. There is some information for users on how to register to vote in primary contests, but much like Trump’s campaign, the operation was designed to grab people’s attention first and then hope that energy translates to on-the-ground results.” This strategy worked, at least for a while. As of April, when Sarlin’s article came out, the site had put up some pretty gaudy numbers. They appear to have slipped of late:
Whatever the story of the site’s traffic, Cis ended up being a case study in the difficulty of defining the difference between “just messing around with” alt-right ideas and actually being seen as embracing them. What does it mean, for example, when TehDonald says that even though Cis is trying to set up an alt-right subreddit and hand it over to white nationalists, he has no “reason to believe that Cis personally holds the views of these people”? I put the question to TehDonald directly. “The distinction is that I believe he was only planning to do it either in the name of free speech or in order to trigger the SJWers and get attention,” he responded.
Cis’s more domineering, authoritarian tendencies appear to have ruffled some feathers. One The_Donald user with close knowledge of the situation sent me a meaty email with a series of damning accusations against Cis (sic throughout this excerpt and the one that follows):
This user also claimed to me that Cis had faked the rumored doxxing threat from a progressive subreddit that had ostensibly caused him to delete his original CisWhiteMaelstrom account recently, only to come back as Dylan-W (that account is now dead as well), at the invitation of TehDonald, during a period of subreddit tumult. (“Cis was brought back during peak drama because of his talent of rallying the sub around a cause; the drama had fractured the community,” said TehDonald. “He did a good job at that, but he started making it about him and dragged things into the subreddit that Trump himself would disavow.”) My correspondent pointed me to this thread as proof. They also contended that Cis and GayLubeOil, who was also removed as a mod Tuesday night and who, like Cis, has roots in “Redpill” men’s rights/pickup artist communities, are writing a book together, and have been manipulating The_Donald for their own personal gain. (“I removed GayLubeOil because he is close personal friends with Cis,” said TehDonald when I asked him about this other user. “It’s not personal, we just had to do it.”)
The correspondent:
What’s striking here, of course, is the way the rise and fall of Cis mirrors the way Trump the candidate has done business. As is the case with Trump, it’s hard to tell where opinions Cis is professing for the sake of ginning up outrage and raising his profile end, and where his “real” opinions begin. The veil of anonymity only heightens these questions — in Trump’s case, you can look back at stuff he said 10 or 20 years ago and compare it to what he’s saying now. Since CisWhiteMaelstrom has existed only as a Reddit troll/provocateur, it’s much more difficult to know what the concept of him “really” believing something even means. Despite having just removed him as a moderator, TehDonald was very complimentary toward Cis, and denied that he holds any hateful views. “Cis is an enormously talented individual and he’s very smart,” he said. Citing Cis’s role in helping to purge r/The_Donald of white nationalists and Nazis, TehDonald continued, “I do not believe that he is a white nationalist (he’s Jewish); the persona you see on the internet is a ‘character’ that he plays.”
Whatever the truth is about Cis, it doesn’t appear, based on many of the most upvoted comments responding to Tuesday’s announcement, that rank-and-file members of The_Donald were all that sad about saying good-bye to this character — though many do appear to appreciate the role he played in boosting the subreddit to where it is today. “Sometimes you have to pivot to the general,” one user philosophized. “He was our Lewandowski and now we need a Manafort. Thanks for growing this dom, Cis, but we’ve got to look to the general.”
An Uber exec recently disclosed that the company knows when you are more likely to pay surge pricing. (It’s when your phone battery is just about to die.) But with a potential app change Uber is rolling out, this might not matter, because you probably won’t notice that surge is even in effect.
The app change, The Verge reports, would eliminate the blue-and-black circle that pops up before you hail a ride, letting you know that your trip will cost you two or three times what it usually does. On that screen, users also have to manually input the surge percentage, a sort of formal acknowledgement they know the ride will cost extra. (Like guac.)
From The Verge:
On its blog, Uber compares the current model, with its informative surge pop-up, as akin to “buying an airline ticket without knowing the full fare until the end of your trip. Or booking a hotel room online and being told that the real price would be 1.3X.” Except the price of airline tickets and hotel rooms don’t drop if the rain stops or you wait another ten minutes and try again. Uber prices, however, do. (Prices start to drop after enough people decide the surge is too pricey and stop requesting cars, driving demand, and fares, down.) Reducing the likelihood that users will even notice they are paying more for their ride makes this an excellent move for Uber’s bottom line. But not a great move for yours.
Sometimes you find yourself confronting questions about your gadgets that are so basic you don’t want to consult your IT guy, your manual, or your niece. That’s why we’re here. This week, in basic answers to basic questions: how to stop your TV from playing everything like a soap opera.
So! The first thing to understand is the concept of a frame rate, normally talked about as “FPS,” or frames per second. There’s no way to explain that without sounding incredibly condescending, so, whatever: Video of any sort (including video games) is displayed on a TV by showing a rapid series of still images, each one referred to as a “frame.” The frame rate is a measurement of how many of those images the TV can rapidly cycle through in a single second.
This is known within the TV-nerd community as the “soap opera effect.” It’s a common problem in which fancy new TVs make everything played on them look cheap, fake, and plasticky. It’s also one of the very few good names for anything in the tech community. It is fixable — and to be honest it’s pretty easy to fix, so if you just want to fix it you can scroll right to the bottom of this page. But if you want to know more about why it happens (so that you can explain it to your family next Thanksgiving), read on.
Even if you can’t quite articulate the difference, you know it intuitively; it’s one of the major reasons why shows shot on video — sports, talk shows, soap operas, multi-camera sitcoms, and reality TV — feel so different than the kinds of prime-time and premium-cable dramas that are shot on film.
Where this gets weird and confusing is that the raw material, like a film or a TV show or a video of a squirrel eating a bagel filmed with an iPhone, has its own native frame rate. Movies and many TV shows have, for decades, been shot at 24fps; it’s become a standard. Digital video (and, before it, analog video) shoots at 30fps.
Instead of just repeating those frames over and over, TV manufacturers got fancy. They decided, unanimously though separately, that they could make images appear smoother, crisper, and clearer with a new technique called “interpolation.”
Interpolation replaces that old technique of simply repeating the still images a few times each second. Instead, it looks at the colors and patterns of each frame and the frame to come after and comes up with a pattern somewhere in between. Like, if in this one second of video, a football is thrown across the screen, in one frame the football might be all the way on the left side of the screen, and in the next frame the football might be all the way on the right side of the screen. Interpolation would stick one or more frames in between those two frames in which the football is somewhere in the middle of the screen.
Motion interpolation isn’t, necessarily, bad. For digital video you won’t notice anything wrong, and most experts suggest that live sports and video games both look better with interpolation turned on. But for movies? You’ll want to turn it off.
So how to do you do that? Each TV manufacturer buried, somewhere in the hellish lists that make up their menus, some kind of interpolation option. It’s different for every TV, but generally searching through the “video” or “playback” settings will help you locate it. On Samsung TVs it’s called AutoMotion Plus, on LGs it’s TruMotion, Sony calls it MotionFlow, Vizio calls it Smooth Motion Effect.
Last night, residents of the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union in a 51.9 percent to 48.1 percent split. It’s a somewhat surprising and hugely important result, one that calls into question the future of Europe and the United Kingdom, and though you may disagree with the result, at least British voters were considered, thoughtful, and fully aware of the consequences of their votes. Right? Right? Hello? Anyone?
The process of leaving the EU will take the U.K. several years. In the meanwhile, if you have further questions, try Google.
According to Google Trends, it seems many people might not have been entirely sure about the effects of voting to leave. A truly comforting thought! Google searches for “what happens if we leave the EU” spiked up 250 percent in the hours following the decision.
It wasn’t the only thing spiking in search results. Here’s another comforting indication:
“What happens if we leave” wasn’t the only question people were asking following the vote. Some people were still unsure if the U.K. was really leaving.
Or who would replace David Cameron as Prime Minister.
In a nutshell, here’s some of what will happen if you leave the EU, people who Googled after the fact. Prime Minister David Cameron will resign and spend the next two years working on the plan for the U.K.’s formal exit from the EU. The value of the pound will likely fall significantly (or rather, even more significantly that it already has in the months prior to the vote) and the U.K. will begin using the money it was previously paying in fees to the EU for things like eliminating the taxes on home-energy bills and funding the National Health Service. The Leave campaign has a number of new laws it wants to push through, like the Asylum and Immigration Control Bill, which would takeaway the right of EU citizens to to freely enter the U.K. and the European Union Law Bill which would allow the U.K. to remove any EU citizen in the U.K. who is “not conducive to the public good.” Also, Donald Trump will likely find a way to make it about himself. (Oh wait, he already did.)
Instead, now when you order a ride, you’ll see a set fare, a small line of text letting you know there’s an additional cost, and no second confirmation or indication of the surge multiplier.
Or maybe you unpack and set up a big new TV, and settle in to enjoy the fruits of your labor. You pick out something that’s supposed to look fantastic — and instead you’re greeted with something that gives you the uncomfortable sensation of watching a soap opera in 35mm. What gives?
TVs have one built-in frame rate that they can display. Older and cheaper TVs are listed at 60Hz, which means in this case the same thing as “frames per second.” That makes the math easy for a digital video shot at 30fps: The TV just displays each frame twice. But for 24fps video, it doesn’t divide as cleanly into the 60fps-displaying TV. So TV manufacturers came up with something called a 2:3 pulldown.
It’s something just about all of us have encountered by now: You’re at your aunt and uncle’s place for Thanksgiving, the football game is over, somebody puts on a movie. And it looks … wrong — almost like it was filmed with the same cameras used to broadcast the football game. Everything is too clear, maybe? Too sharp? Is that possible?
Breaking an iPhone is relatively easy. Drop it on the subway, or into your toilet, or let it slip from your hand as you exit a cab only to hear that horrible crunch telling you to carve an hour into your day because you now need to get a new phone. It’s horrible. Which is one reason that this YouTuber’s attempts to intentionally demolish his iPhone in bizarre ways is so deeply satisfying.
The VanMoof Electrified S is pretty much impossible to steal. Which is good, because it costs $3,000.

Covering up your webcam with a piece of tape is the least of your worries when Stuxnet-like weapons are aimed at entire power infrastructures. “We’re the ones who are probably the most vulnerable. One of the reasons that a portion of the Ukrainian grid came online so quickly is because their grid is so old-school that they still have things like Manual, when it comes back to turning back on the lights,” said Gibney. Meanwhile, everything in the U.S. is jacked into the Matrix like Keanu, and infrastructure execs aren’t exactly listening to their tech engineers about how to fix the gaps. (If you really hate sleeping soundly at night, you can read more about what could happen to NYC if our infrastructure was hacked here.)
Gibney appeared at a special screening in New York City Thursday night hosted by WSJ+, along with Chien and O’Murchu to discuss all things Stux. Here are a few things we learned from their Q&A, led by journalist Tanya Rivero.
1. Stuxnet’s still out there. Stuxnet has already done its damage on the nuclear centrifuges at the facility in Natanz, and yeah, there have been patches, but that doesn’t mean it’s not still floating around out there. O’Murchu revealed, “We still see computers infected with it, even to this day. It’s autonomous, so it can just keep spreading, and people use USB keys and pass them around — it just keeps going. It’s not going to do any damage any more; there’s dates in there so that the centrifuges won’t be affected any more, but we still see customers with it.” Good news for your nuclear centrifuges, but not so hot for your PC.
2. Cyber warfare is worringly like Dr. Strangelove. One of the major frustrations Gibney had was the stony silent treatment he received from government insiders about Stuxnet, despite the fact that it’s not exactly on the down low any more. “Everybody knew about Stuxnet, everybody had agreed that it was Israel and the United States that had conducted the operation, but I couldn’t get officials to even say that Stuxnet had existed, so there was a kind of emperor’s new clothes quality about it that I found particularly frustrating, in this context,” Gibney said. “That ended up being very much a part of the subject of the film itself, because it’s the offensive cyber weapons and the strategy of pursuing offensive cyber weapons as a deterrent rather than focusing on defense, combined with the idea that all that would be kept secret — it’s a little bit like Dr. Strangelove. And so the secrecy itself was causing a real danger, and that then became one of the themes of the film.”
3. Gibney went to great lengths to protect his sources — including creating a digitally rendered character to give voice to their quotes. Gibney managed to get interviews with several inside sources, although he won’t say how many — but it wasn’t easy. He used a couple of different things to assure his resources their anonymity would be preserved. First, they went analogue. “We recorded their testimony on a digital recorder, not internet-connected, and then had the transcripts typed up on an electric typewriter, also not internet-connected, and then destroyed the digital recordings,” Gibney revealed. Actress Joanne Tucker plays a digitally rendered character whose script is comprised of the sources’ interviews, which added another layer of obfuscation. “There are many, many moments where the script is verbatim, and in some cases we changed things if it felt like certain remarks would be too revealing of who the characters were, but [we] always kept the essential meaning intact.”
5. Stuxnet is partly the result of a “Weiner moment” by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad accidentally revealed some key details that helped Stuxnet developers out an awful lot, just by taking a film crew around the Natanz facility. Gibney referred to this footage as “Ahmadinejad’s Weiner moment, that he was so proud of the nuclear facility at Natanz that he was strutting through not understanding that he was giving quite valuable intelligence to a number of people.” Although some of the footage is online, it wasn’t easy to track it all down. “Some of it was available through private sources. It took a lot of shoe-leather work through my very able team, led by Sarah Dowland and Javier Alberto Botero, who are both here tonight, and no, we didn’t license it. We used it via the Fair Use doctrine,” said Gibney.
6. ISIS has a long way to go before it can achieve anything on the technical level of Stuxnet. It’s cold comfort, but Chien said, “Currently, the types of attacks ISIS have been doing have primarily been propaganda attacks … primarily doing things like disinformation campaigns, taking over Twitter accounts, causing denial of services on certain websites — pretty rudimentary-type cyber attacks. That’s currently what we’ve been seeing.” Gibney added, “Part of what you need to know when you’re launching a Stuxnet-type attack is not just code, but you need human assets, and you need a certain amount of spy work to understand the machines that you’re going to attack before you launch the computer code, so it does become a more complex operation.” So, at least there’s that.
7. Advice for college grads? Study computer security. Practically every tech-minded college grad has apps on the brain, but what happens when that boom goes bust? Chien pointed out, “There are very few college grads today understanding the low levels of computing and how computers work at a very low level, which is what’s required for this job. What I think what we love about this job, and why we’re super-passionate about it, is it’s unique in some sense. While we have competitors in this business, also creating security products, when we go in the office, we’re not thinking about, how do we make another dollar? How do we beat our competitor? We go to the office and think about how we can defeat these adversaries, how we can defeat these hackers, and those hackers are constantly changing.” Now that Stuxnet and its progeny are setting up back doors in practically every country’s infrastructure, one thing’s for sure. There’s a great future in tech security.
4. Chien and O’Murchu track 100 cyber-war operations they believe were launched by governments. Zero Days won’t exactly help you sleep easier at night. O’Murchu said, “We see all sorts of hacks, and I think if most people knew what we see, they would be very, very scared.” The sort of stuff floating across their screens at Symantec is scary on a global level, and it’s gotten much worse since Stuxnet. “We’re tracking 100 different operations on a day-to-day basis that we are very confident are being launched and being maintained by governments,” O’Murchu said. Chien later added, “The thing with cyber is there is a relatively low threshold to start a cyber-offensive program. When Stuxnet came out, every other country realized, ‘Wow, this is practically possible. Someone is doing this. We should get into this game, too.’”
It all started on Reddit’s /r/pics subreddit when a Redditor shared a photo of the man, rocking an excellently patterned shirt and looking like a male Marilyn Monroe. It wasn’t long before other users started sharing photos of the same man, standing in the exact same position and wearing the same shirt-shorts combo. “He does this every day. He’s well known in Philly …being a Philly resident, I’m not in the least surprised a ton of people have pics. He hands out Jesus pamphlets and is very nice,” one Redditor commented. Someone found the man in a Google Earth still from 2014. And today, another person set up a livestream camera filing the man’s traditional spot, first noted by Motherboard (He was only visible for a few minutes, but the stream is still live.)
Surprisingly, the comments in the Reddit thread regarding the photos and the video are relatively friendly as far as Reddit comments go. (If you don’t know what I’m talking about here, consider yourself lucky. People are gross and terrible.) People are calling the man a “legend” and a “hero” and declaring he needs to star in his own documentary. But Motherboard’s Jason Koebler has a slightly different take.
Koebler’s fears are understandable. But the thing is, the potential that a photo of you will be taken without your knowledge and posted online isn’t a 2016 invention. It’s something that we’ve long since accepted Sanyo released the first camera phone in the United States and everyone’s mother went into a tizzy about sexting and privacy. Something most people have, over a decade, come to accept as if a-okay. (Or at the very least, as a likelihood anytime you are out and about and looking notable.) This “surreptitious live video stream” is just a natural progression from still images in funny tweets and Facebook posts.
To be fair, somebody probably should tell the street-grate man he’s becoming a web celeb, but not for legal reasons. But rather, as one Redditor put it, because he’s “the next internet meme in the making.”
Self-driving cars are, likely, the future of transportation. But self-driving technology hasn’t quite evolved the levels of safety needed for it to become the new norm just yet. This means, of course, no napping in your Tesla. But more importantly, it means engineers, manufacturers, city planners, and lawmakers have a pressing need to determine the ethics of the driverless car, particularly surrounding potential crashes and accidents.
In theory, a self-driving car makes no mistakes. It accelerates and stops and pulls off K-turns without ever bumping into the curb. But there will always be objects that move a little more than curbs — namely, humans. In a study conducted with U.S. participants from a team at the University of Toulouse Capitole in France, people explained they’d prefer the kind of safer world that driverless vehicles could provide — and that self-driving cars should always protect the driver only after protecting lives of those outside the car, like other drivers or pedestrians.
“We found that the large majority of people strongly feel that the car should sacrifice its passenger for the greater good,” Jean-François Bonnefon, the survey team’s leader, told Popular Mechanics. Even when it’s not the driver’s fault, or even when participants themselves were the driver in the scenario, or when they were the driver sharing the car with a family member or their own kids.
While this both makes some utilitarian sense and makes people seem altruistic, there’s a catch: Presented with the option to actually purchase a self-driving car programmed for “the greater good,” people said they’d rather buy one programmed to save themselves. Which means that while people are optimistic about self-driving cars in the hypothetical sense, when it comes to actually getting behind the wheel of one, they remain skeptical and, perhaps understandably, selfish.
Removing loose teeth in strange and possibly dangerous ways is a rite of passage. There’s the classic apple trick, or the string tied to a door option — or its more risky cousin: the “string tied to a toaster and thrown over a bannister” maneuver. In the second grade, a friend of mine even punched himself in the face to free a wigging incisor. And if none of those work, there are always squirrels.
Last week, YouTuber Viva Frei posted a video of himself and his daughter, Mila (who is rocking an excellent Hello Kitty T-shirt), sitting on a park bench. He announces that the pair are about to perform “an absolute internet first,” by tying one end of a piece of string to his daughter’s loose tooth and the other end to a hunk of granola. What a fun family bonding activity!
Mila, you are a total champ. Can’t wait to watch your dad stream the next one on Facebook Live.
As if you didn’t already have too many Android devices to choose from: Google is supposedly rolling out its first Google-branded phone (read: a non-Nexus device) by the end of 2016, The Telegraph reported this morning.
It’s an unsurprising rumor to hear: Google CEO Sundar Pichai has publicly commented on the company’s emphasis on phones, and Motorola’s Rick Osterloh was hired earlier this year to head up a new hardware division. And there’s also the much discussed Google Ara, a modular phone which lets you swap out pieces like a camera or speakers and is slated for release in 2017.
But Google is already working with hardware companies like LG and Huawei on the Nexus line of phones, which are made to the company’s exact design specifications but are manufactured by third parties. It’s hard to see how Google could take more control over design or software than it already does with Nexus, and while the company is likely eager to move into the manufacturing space, the timeline for Ara hasn’t changed, and it seems unlikely that this new mystery Google phone is going to jump in front and actually become available to the public by year’s end.
In the meanwhile, there are plenty of iPhone rumors to gawk at, since that device will likely be available in the fall.
Instead of checking your phone for the weather, why not just take a look at that little box on your windowsill called a tempescope? If it’s raining outside, it will start raining in this thing. While it didn’t reach its Indiegogo funding goal, its open-source template has allowed developers around the world to re-create it.
DJ Khaled’s Snapchat style typically consists of antics like getting lost on a Jet Ski, doling out life advice — “major keys” — and expressing general gratitude for his life (including his current gig as the opening act for Beyoncé’s Formation tour). But he’s got some, um, more graphic content planned in the coming months.
“Actually, I wanna Snapchat the whole birth,” Khaled said on Jimmy Kimmel Live! When Kimmel asked what his fiancée had to say about broadcasting the birth, Khaled seemed convinced it wouldn’t be an issue. “The key is that I’m the king and every queen should support the king. I’m a talk to the doctor and if he says everything is going to run smooth, meaning that the queen is right and my son is right, if it’s running smooth … I can just do my thing.” (For the record, men, saying “The 🔑 is that I’m the 👑 and every 👸 should support the 👑” is not a good way to get your wife to do things.)
Khaled followed up by saying he thinks his son is “definitely going to have a beard” and that he already considers him a “young icon.” Which would make a great album name to be honest. Perhaps a follow-up to Khaled’s upcoming album Major Key.
Fresh on the heels of a new standalone app and increased video length to 140 seconds, Twitter announced today another bold new feature: stickers.
Yes, stickers! The stickers will rotate in and out (a technique that has worked well for Snapchat’s facial filters) and include “hundreds of accessories, emoji, and props to make your photos more fun,” according to the company’s blog. “Use them to share what you’re doing or how you’re feeling, to show support for a cause, or to just add some flair. You can use multiple stickers on a photo, resize and rotate them, and place them anywhere on your picture.” Boy, this feels like … Snapchat!
The most interesting thing about the update isn’t that your timeline will now be filled with cartoon champagne bottles and snorkels, but rather that Twitter will allow users to search by sticker. If you tap on a specific sticker, you’ll be redirected to a new timeline full of tweets from people also using that sticker, likely for a wide range of reasons. (Just think of the think-piece opportunities!) It’s similar to Instagram’s search by emoji option, a.k.a. the platform’s easiest way to find NSFW content. And it also bears a resemblance to Facebook Messenger’s search feature, which started with the app’s stickers and later evolved into GIFs and now lets users search for GIFs based on keywords and phrases, like “happy,” or “get me the hell out of here.”
While stickers might seems like child’s play, they are also likely a smart move for Twitter, which hasn’t been doing super hot of late. It gives users a reason to spend more time engaging with the app and, frankly, seem kind of fun. (Who doesn’t love an opportunity to plaster pictures with completely irreverent stickers?) And any time Twitter can get users (who aren’t weirdos in media already spending their lives online) to spend on the platform is a good move.
As anyone with internet access will tell you, the best thing about sporting events is not the actual, you know, sporting, but rather the new memes a televised game can inspire. (Crying piccolo girl, crying saxophone girl, every kiss cam that has ever gone wrong.) In the case of a recent game in the College World Series between the TCU Horned Frogs and Coastal Carolina Chanticleers, we were given this child, who stared directly into ESPN’s cameras and pulled a full-on dramatic chipmunk followed by a side-eye-filled dance break.
I do not know who won the game and I don’t care to find out. I also don’t know who this kid is, but that I’d really like to find out so as to inquire about his expert camera-trolling skills. Young freckle-faced genius, if you’re reading this, please teach us your ways.
With a little help from folks at Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington, Disney has created a technology that could have a major impact on both entertainment and education. The tiniest of modifications can turn your newspaper into a light switch. Check it out for yourself.
If you’ve got location services enabled for Facebook on your phone, the company can use that data to generate “People You May Know” suggestions. (That is, when it’s not suggesting that cousin everyone avoids at weddings and the guy who robbed you at knifepoint.)
In a report from Fusion yesterday, a Facebook representative said that the social platform’s “People You May Know” feature shows you “people based on mutual friends, work and education information, networks you’re part of, contacts you’ve imported and many other factors.” Included among the “many other factors,” the rep also explained, was location data.
This is, as the spokesperson acknowledged to us, a contradiction from the original statement given to Fusion. So where’s the confusion? A Facebook source told Select All that at one point, city-level location data was a factor in the friend-suggestion algorithm — but it only temporarily, among a small test group, and never rolled out to the general public.
For iPhone users, head over to “Settings” and then tap to “Privacy.” You’ll see “Location Services” at the top of the screen with a blue-and-white arrow icon. (The same one you see at the top of your screen if you have location services turned on.) You’ll be shown a list of your apps in alphabetical order. Scroll down and select “Facebook.” From there, you’ll be shown three options: “never,” “while using the app,” and “always.” To fully disable the function, you need to tap “never.”
The world would be a better place, I think, if television manufacturers just didn’t bother including speakers in their TVs at all. The existence of speakers inside TVs is dangerous: Yes, they do, technically, make sound; but they’re terrible, and the one and only inarguable, not-up-for-debate fact about home theater is that you need to buy a separate audio setup. And we can help you do that.
A good sound system hooked up to the TV is not an optional accessory; it is essential. To use whichever tinny, distorted rat traps of speakers that Samsung or LG found lying on the floor of a warehouse in Shenzhen is an insult to the movies or music you’re trying to enjoy. Luckily, there are plenty of options, ranging from very technical and finicky to extremely easy, and on all parts of the price spectrum, that can give your movies, TV, and music excellent sound quality, the sound quality they deserve. If you want to spend a hundred bucks or many thousands, that’s up to you, but the fact is, you have to buy something.
It’s been seven years since Uber formally launched and five since the company started offering rides in New York City. And frankly, using the service has lost its luster. Sure, an air-conditioned car that comes at your command is nice. But I’m craving something new. Something that will really set me apart. Something like … a hot-air balloon.
It makes sense to figure out which of these connection options your TV has, because they’ll clue you in a little bit to what kind of audio system you should buy.
Two newer options are an optical audio port, a not-quite-square port that uses fiber optics to carry sound back and forth, and the HDMI port, the trapezoidal port you use to plug in basically all video stuff right now (Roku, cable box, Apple TV, etc., etc.).
If only I lived in Shanghai! Two new programs announced at TechCrunch Shanghai earlier this week — the unimaginatively named UberBoat and UberBalloon — will apparently allow people to grab rides in these less-traditional modes of transit. Unfortunately for many of us, these programs are, as of yet, only going to be available in China. Which makes sense given Uber’s plan to overtake rival taxi service Didi Chuxing, which has been operating in China several years longer than Uber.
And if anything could give Uber the boost it needs to usurp Didi and take control of the market, hot-air balloons are definitely the move. It worked out pretty well for that guy in The Wizard of Oz.
Which gives you the best quality audio? To most ears, it won’t make a huge difference, but the HDMI port supports the highest-quality audio streams. If you have a TV that was made in the last few years, you’re almost certainly already using HDMI for some video and audio. But there are good reasons to make use of your optical audio port, which I’ll get to below. Generally, the other inputs you’ll only need if you decide to go with older audio equipment — and I’m not saying you shouldn’t. My own system, made up of all flea-market garbage from several decades ago, relies on the lowly headphone jack on my TV. This is fine.
Some older TVs will have what are still called RCA connectors: those red and white plugs that have been around since the 1940s. (They’re sometimes paired with a yellow one, which carries video, but we don’t have to worry about that now.) Some TVs will come with a simple 3.5-mm jack, otherwise known as a headphone jack: It’s the same as the one on your iPhone that takes your earbuds.
The very easiest option is to buy a soundbar system. This is an evolution of what used to by called a Home Theater in a Box, now much simplified. Typically a soundbar setup consists of one long speaker (which actually includes several small speakers within it) and a subwoofer. The long speaker is placed just below the TV, and the subwoofer placed somewhere else in the room (it doesn’t matter where). Sometimes these even come with an extra couple of little speakers to get some surround-sound-type atmosphere.
My tip for a soundbar: Use your optical audio port. Some soundbars offer HDMI connectivity, but I don’t think that’s a great option; you’ll have to plug all your video stuff — your cable box and PS4 — into the soundbar rather than your TV, essentially making your soundbar, not your TV, the central switchboard for all your inputs. Chances are your TV has more HDMI ports than the soundbar, and it’s also much easier to navigate switching between inputs on your TV than by using your soundbar remote. Optical is your friend here.
Most soundbars are similar in quality and price, so you may want to make your choice based on how much space you have in your setup. Vizio’s SB2920 ($78.00), which doesn’t come with a subwoofer, is a good basic option for small rooms; if you’ve got more space (or more money), the SB3821 ($159.75) is a good upgrade; and the excellently reviewed SB3851 ($248.00) includes two satellite speakers for a something-like-surround-sound experience. And if you can’t fit a soundbar in front of your TV at all, the ZVOX cabinet ($299.99) doubles as a stand.
If you want to opt for something a little more advanced, without it necessarily being much more complicated, you’re going to have to buy into a legit stereo, by which I mean a receiver and some passive speakers.
A receiver is a big box with a lot of buttons on it, into which you plug speakers. (Shut up, audiophiles.) Passive speakers are so named because they don’t plug into the wall themselves; when plugged into the receiver, the receiver does the work of powering them and pumping sound through them.
This setup is much more flexible; you can use as many or as few speakers as you’d like, place them anywhere you want, and replace any at any time. You can buy any size of speaker that you want, or any brand, any shape. You can have a subwoofer or not, a center speaker or not.
More important, a speaker-receiver setup sounds better for cheaper than any soundbar. And most important of all, it looks sick as hell. A receiver and speakers are just, like, cool-looking gadgets: big and blocky and muscular and utilitarian.
If you go this route, there are tons of options; going vintage is less of a bad idea with a stereo than with most other gadgetry, because most of the big advancements in receiver tech (connectivity like HDMI and Bluetooth, support for new speaker arrangements, better interfaces, better energy-efficiency) are sort of optional. A wood-paneled speaker from the 1970s like this one, paired with a couple of decent modern speakers, looks super cool, can sound great, and comes in at a very cheap price.
That said, buying decades-old equipment isn’t for everyone. New receivers are not really very expensive, and still look pretty cool. To buy a receiver you have to first figure out how many speakers you’ll want — from a traditional two-speaker stereo set to a full five-speaker surround-sound experience. The important spec there is called “channels,” written as X.Y; the first number refers to the total number of speakers the receiver can support, and the second the number of subwoofers. So a 5.1 channel receiver, like the well-reviewed Pioneer VSX-530-K ($199.99), can support five speakers total, one of which is a subwoofer (the other four are usually two front and two rear). A 2.0 channel receiver, like the Sony STRDH130 ($118.00) can only support two speakers and no subwoofer.
Once you’ve got your receiver, it’s time to shop for speakers. You’ll probably first want to look at “bookshelf speakers,” which offer an ideal combination of price, power, and size. These are fairly small, usually around a foot or so tall, but you’d be shocked at what kind of sound you can get out of them. I have the previous generation of the Pioneer SP-BS22-LR ($126.98), which sound spectacular. If you want to splurge, it’s easy to find some that are quite a bit more expensive, like these Wirecutter-recommended KEFQ100B ($339.54).
This may not be quite right: In an email to Select All, a Facebook representative says that location is not a factor in how the company suggests people to friend:
From Facebook:
*This post has been updated to include new information from Facebook.
Once you’ve got your gear, setup is easy: You connect the speakers to the receiver with very old-school speaker cable, which you can buy in bulk for dirt cheap, and connect the receiver to your TV using the output of your choice.
People get nervous about home-audio shopping, and for good reason: The people who care about this stuff are all extremely crazy, and if you start to read reviews of audio equipment you’ll end up in a deep dark hole with perfectly smooth walls on which are scrawled things like “balanced soundstage” and “intermodular distortion” and “burn-in period.” You can very safely ignore all of that garbage and just buy the top-rated Amazon receiver and speakers that fit your budget and the number of speakers you want in your setup, and be extremely happy.
Cormac McCarthy, famed American author and playwright best known for works like The Road and No Country for Old Men, is not dead. He did not suffer a heart attack at the age of 82. He is, by all accounts, fine. But this morning, a now-deleted tweet from USA Today claimed otherwise, proclaiming McCarthy’s demise.
The “rogue” account was one that claimed to be a “news” Twitter for Knopf publishing. The real Knopf account has over 250,000 followers and has published more than 11,000 tweets; the fake one has just over 1,000 followers, and had tweeted only four times. After USA Today’s false report, the fake revealed itself: “This account is hoax created by Italian journalist Tommasso Debenedetti. McCarthy is alive and well.”
It’s a little surprising that USA Today was so quickly hoaxed by an account without verification, and a total of six tweets, and a death announcement claiming the author died “for stroke.” But getting to something first (and the SEO traffic rewards that come with that) is often a digital news organization’s top priority. Which is exactly the point De Benedetti has said he is trying to make when he creates these fake Twitter announcements. It’s a silly, obvious, point. But the fact that people keep falling for the obvious hoaxes feels like a good reason for it to keep getting made.
In Twitter’s early days, De Benedetti managed to convince a number of people that Pope Francis, Fidel Castro, Pedro Almodovar — among others — had died. He posed as the former president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, and made false announcements under Karzai’s name. Back in 2012, De Benedetti spoke with The Guardian about his hoaxes. “Twitter works well for deaths,” De Benedetti told the paper. “Social media is the most unverifiable information source in the world but the news media believes it because of its need for speed.”
If that name sounds familiar, it’s because De Benedetti, an Italian journalist and teacher, has been in the hoax game since before most people had heard of Twitter. He started by selling fake interviews to Italian newspapers with American writers like John Grisham. (He was eventually caught.) He convinced the International Herald Tribune to run a fake letter from Umberto Eco, and Italian writer and philosopher, regarding the war in Libya. (He later sent a letter explaining to the paper what he had tricked them into doing.)
So, while the “other factors” remain unclear, here’s how to turn off location tracking on the Facebook app, just in case.
The paper followed up with a second tweet saying they were still trying to verify the death announcement’s authenticity. And then a third tweet, explaining that USA Today had been had by “a ‘rogue’ Twitter account.”
And then he got on Twitter.
De Benedetti’s methods are straightforward, and (at this point) fairly well-known. The McCarthy hoax was no exception. He creates a Twitter account under a the name of a fairly well-known person, usually a literary figure — in this case, Don DeLillo — builds a small but often influential following, and then changes the handle, picture, and bio to one that seems superficially like an official account. He can usually count on one or two followers, scrolling through their feeds without stopping to think whether or not they follow the “AKnopfNews” Twitter account, to retweet whatever bit of hoax news he wants to seed. In this case, Joyce Carol Oates shared the fake news of McCarthy’s death, lending the item some legitimacy. From there, Twitter’s frictionless sharing tools more or less do the rest of the work. It’s a bit frightening, actually, how easily someone can do this. (Though it’s not usually as effective, just ask these kids who impersonated school officials on Twitter in an attempt to ensure a snow day.)

In April, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg told a crowd of developers that he heard “fearful voices calling for building walls.” At the time it was widely assumed he was talking about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. But perhaps he was just hearing the voices echoing across his enormous Hawaiian estate?
Back in 2014, the Facebook CEO purchased 700 acres of land on the island of Kauai for a cool $100 million. (House not included.) Now, he’s constructing a six-foot-high stone wall around the Hawaiian property. And his neighbors aren’t exactly thrilled with the giant pile of organized rocks that now stare back at them from where the ocean used to be.
“The feeling of it is really oppressive. It’s immense,” wall hater and Kilauea resident Gy Hall told The Garden Island. “It’s really sad that somebody would come in, and buy a huge piece of land and the first thing they do is cut off this view that’s been available and appreciative by the community here for years.” Another resident explained the new wall cuts off the sea breeze, thereby increasing the temperature for anybody on the other side of it.
A representative from Zuckerberg’s camp told Gizmodo that the real purpose of the wall is to eliminate noise from the nearby highway. (The same one people used to enjoy driving down before the nice ocean view was obstructed by the aforementioned wall.)
Zuck’s not the first Facebook bigwig to annoy others with major landscaping projects: In 2013, early investor Sean Parker got in trouble with the state of California for staging an elaborate steampunk wedding in Big Sur that allegedly wreaked havoc on the redwood forest. But it’s hard to hear the complaints of your neighbors when you’ve got a big wall surrounding you!

Moms love Pinterest. Brides love Pinterest. This dad from Brooklyn loves Pinterest. Mark Zuckerberg probably loved Pinterest right up until his account got hacked. But a few updates from the company are here to remind us that, in addition to providing a digital corkboard full of pictures of princess-cut diamonds and coffee-brewing alarm clocks captioned “MUST HAVE,” Pinterest also needs to make money. And the best way to do that is commerce.
This week, Pinterest introduced a new way to purchase pinned items, building on the “Buy Button” it introduced in 2015. Called “Buyable Pins,” these pinned items will be priced to sell from 20,000 merchants (including brands like Tory Burch and Wayfair) and include over ten million items. (These were also initially introduced in 2015, but are now available across desktop and mobile.) Users will also be able to filter by individual sellers and save items in a shopping bag to peruse later. (The shopping bag will also be used to source data so Pinterest can later recommend other items you might like to buy.) The company also introduced a new visual-search option, which lets users tap on an item in an image, like a lamp in a pinned picture of a greige dream bedroom and then be shown images of similar lamps. And, of course, those lamps would also be for sale. (Though it’s worth noting Pinterest stands to make money from ads, not the items themselves.)
With a user base over 100-million strong and with those users pinning four million items per day, Pinterest has many, specifically millions, of opportunities each week to turn already engaged users into engaged shoppers. Which will probably work, given that evolving Pinterest into a commerce platform takes the hassle out of having to leave your pins and track down your desired items elsewhere. By making these changes, Pinterest is bringing the mountain to Mohammed. Or rather, bringing the 16 pastel beer koozies to a bachelorette party.
Do you ever wish you’d invented something brilliant — Snuggies, Crocs, that thing that turns all of your vegetables into noodles — so you could retire young and live out your days on some Hawaiian island? So does Thomas Ross. Except Ross claims he actually did invent something brilliant, the iPhone, and is now suing Apple for damages.
According to Ross, the 43-year-old Floridian filed a patent back in 1992 for an “Electronic Reading Device,” Apple blog MacRumors reports. His hand-drawn design features a rectangular screened device with several buttons on the front and sides. If you squint, it looks like an iPhone … or an early-stage rendering of any other e-reader, rectangular cell phone, or Game Boy that has ever graced the market.
Sadly for Ross, he lost the patent three years later in 1995 after failing to pay the application fee. Despite this lack of ownership, he’s still suing Apple for $10,000,000, citing “great and irreparable injury that cannot fully be compensated or measured in money.” He also wants royalties up to 1.5 percent for all other “infringing devices.” (Think iPads and iPods.) All we have to say is, good luck, sir. And, also, maybe pay that application fee next time, since it was probably at lot less than $10 billion.
Here’s what our forward thinker had in mind for his device, according to MacRumors.
If you’re not familiar with Reddit Photoshop battles, here’s what you need to know: A redditor submits a photo and then hordes of other Photoshop-savvy redditors edit the photo to their heart’s content until one is declared a victor.
This week, someone submitted an image of Game of Thrones’ Carice van Houten and Kerry Ingram (better known as Melisandre and Shireen) hanging out backstage. In the original, van Houten is clutching Ingram in one arm and a box of flameless candles in the other. It’s not a bad joke, but just wait …
Usually, redditors will go round and round with dozens of people submitting manipulated images. But in this battle, the clear, chosen ascendant to the throne emerged early and quickly. “You win … That’s it we don’t need any other submission on this thread, pack your shit boys,” wrote one redditor about the picture. “Nothing else to see here folks. /u/s3w4g3 [Reddit user] with the flawless victory,” added another.
We won’t spoil the joke in case you haven’t seen it, but if you want to have a sense of why it’s funny you can read this recap. Otherwise we’ll just call it a sick burn and leave it at that.
Recently I discovered that Google is more in touch with my emotions than I am. It was the last stage of a breakup, the coda to the relationship where you air over email your lingering doubts, demands, and disbelief. I still believed I could muster the eloquence and maturity to patch things back together. I would elaborate my feelings, the force of which would move and persuade my ex-girlfriend, and my confidence grew with every word I typed. When I scrolled again to the bottom of her email, though, Gmail suggested a computer-generated response that was shorter, clearer, and, I realized, all I really wanted to tell her: “I miss you so much.”
The suggestion had been generated by what Google calls an “industrial strength neural network.” The network had “consumed” the words of my ex-girlfriend’s email in order to “produce a vector” and “synthesize a grammatically correct reply one word at a time.” The suggestions started to appear in trios at the bottom of emails in my inbox last November, when Google announced a new “Smart Reply” feature that would “determine if an email was answerable with a short reply, and compose a few suitable responses.”
I used Smart Replies at first to swerve conversations in weird directions. Once, a friend emailed a passage from a book he was reading about the Battle of Berlin: “Bits of bodies splashed against the boarded-up store front. Men and women lay in the street screaming and writhing in agony.” I chose the reply “Pics?” He replied to my Smart Reply with another, and, as the robot answers piled up, Google forgot the initial war crime and seemed to start arranging a hookup with itself. The computer grew hungrier for photos — “Can I see a pic?” “Did you get my pics?” “No pics?”— and eventually furnished an invitation my friend said was familiar from Grindr: “Can you host?”
Ever since British computer scientist Alan Turing proposed the famous “Turing test” in 1950, engineers have been trying to build robots that convincingly simulate human conversation. In recent years, they made a breakthrough: Rather than coding computers to follow long lists of rigid rules, they started to write more flexible programs that could learn from past experiences. Greg Corrado, a senior research scientist on the Google Brain Team, told me Smart Reply had digested a database of anonymous historical emails that Google keeps. “It doesn’t look in the database for similar emails or anything like that,” he said. “It’s just that it’s been exposed to the patterns in the past. It’s learned how these things go.”
So Smart Reply had an ulterior motive. It wanted to disabuse me of heartbreak’s egoism. “It’s because this is not the first breakup that has happened over email that it knows what’s going on,” Corrado said. “There have been breakups in the past and there are many different ways they can go. As long as all those ways happen with sufficient frequency in the data, then that’s the kind of thing the system can learn to imitate.” (I wonder who inspired the other two suggestions to my ex’s email. What stoic hero would have answered, “I understand”? And were they dimwits or geniuses who wrote, “So what are you doing now?”)
You didn’t need to be a professional writer to find this unsettling. We already live in a world where machines can figure out what movie we want to watch or food we want to eat. What happens when they start to speak for us? Two months after Google introduced Smart Reply, the company said it was already being used in 10 percent of all responses in the mobile Inbox app. Facebook, meanwhile, unveiled this month a neural network called DeepText, which it said “can understand with near-human accuracy the textual content of several thousands posts per second.”
These programs suggested a future where a computer figures out what we need or want or ought to say before we find the words ourselves. We feed our raw emotions to a technology company, which averages them with the emotions of others and feeds them back to us as something simpler, blander, but also more direct. I’d rather be a monkey banging on a typewriter for eternity: My eloquence might be occasional and accidental, but at least it would be my own.
Corrado urged me not to fear Smart Reply technology, however. “Having an original notion or a completely new idea? That is not what the system does at all,” he said. “What it does is enable you to focus on writing the part of the email that is really original authorship, as opposed to quick niceties or vapid small talk.”
In my sadness, I was willing to accept Smart Reply as an ally, not an enemy — but not because it saved me from writing quick niceties. Rather, Smart Reply’s “I miss you so much” homed in on the subtext of my wordiness and exposed, with total neutrality, what I wanted to hide out of fear of seeming weak. In stating the obvious, Google didn’t help me figure out what I really had to say. It helped me realize there was nothing left to say at all.
But sometimes Smart Reply was eerily perceptive. I started to respect the service after it identified some paternal wisdom my dad had sent me. “Thanks for the advice,” it suggested — an appropriate-enough answer that I was tempted to pass off as my own. Now the technology had evolved beyond offering convenient replies to miming true emotion. It was the Smart Reply’s intensifier that stung the most. “I miss you” would have been a common courtesy, but “I miss you so much” was a cry for help. It was as though the computer could feel my frustration. Google got me.
If you look at the top five spots on the Apple App Store “free” chart right now, you’ll find Facebook in fifth place. Instagram and Snapchat ring in at fourth and third, respectively, and Facebook Messenger takes second place. But the winner is a new, live video streaming app you’ve probably never heard of called live.ly. And it’s about to be everywhere.
The app, complete with its creepy eyeball icon, was only fully released on the app store last Thursday. Since then, it has been downloaded by over half a million people and counting, TechCrunch reports. With Periscope, Facebook Live, and Tumblr Live Video, the streaming space is already fairly crowded, which makes live.ly’s jump to the top so impressive. (Also, its parent company did almost no promotion for the new app.)
Or at least it seems impressive until you realize live.ly is the livestreaming arm of the same company that created musical.ly, a megapopular lip synching app which raised $100,000,000 earlier this year. Musical.ly is only about a year old and in that time has seen 100 million downloads, predominantly from teens. (Variety reports that 50 percent of all U.S. teens have the musical.ly app.) Live.ly’s overnight success can be linked directly to those same teens downloading the app based on their already honed obsessions with musical.ly. Which bodes well for when the two apps eventually integrate and the whole world is ruled by teenagers from their phones.
Like a white raven soaring up from the Citadel, Facebook announced this morning that it is adjusting its News Feed algorithm to favor posts from users’ friends and families over posts from Facebook pages run by publishers and other third parties. For most Facebook users, this is probably good news in the short term: More photographs and updates from people you actually know and care about, and fewer desperately pandering brands affecting the voices of social-media-using humans! But for the digital publishers that now more or less wholly rely on Facebook to serve up a properly sized audience, this is knot-in-your-stomach news. Winter isn’t coming — it’s here.
In a perfect world, Uber rides would involve a totally safe door-to-door trip with a thoroughly vetted driver. And on the flip side, passengers would be respectful of said driver, and not aggressively drunk and throwing up out the window. But again, that’s in a perfect world. Instead, today Uber is rolling out a few changes in 11 U.S. cities that it says will help ensure greater ride safety for both parties.
Now Uber drivers will be able to see how well they’re driving through some new features on the driver version of the Uber app on their phones. (Which Uber would like to mention should be mounted to the dashboard and not in their hands while driving.) Uber will be tracking a driver’s speed, location, braking, and sending reminders to take a break once and a while, the company announced on its blog today. This data won’t be shown to riders, but it will be used by Uber as a way to cross-check rider complaints and hold drivers more accountable.
And the truth is, it’s unclear what could feasibly get built on the ashes. This is why “just create good stuff and the audience will follow” is ultimately unconvincing. Web display advertisements command a fraction of the price that print ads do; for media outlets to make enough money to survive, they needed to find an audience at an order of magnitude (or several) larger than they might have needed as a print publication. No matter how good your stuff is, where else are you going to find a Facebook-sized audience besides Facebook?
So digital publishers react to Facebook’s announcements with more than a little trepidation. It remains to be seen how much the new tweaks will affect the publishers who need Facebook traffic to hit their audience targets. A similar change announced a little over a year ago was accompanied by evidence of slower growth and shorter reach, but last year’s change was largely lost amid the simultaneous boom in Facebook video, which helped expand the reach of publishers’ Facebook pages enormously.
As for creating safer riders, Uber is still working on a fix for that. The company notes that 80 percent of their riders say using Uber keeps them from drinking and driving, which is great, but doesn’t fix the problem for the unsuspecting Uber driver who now has to deal with a backseat full of belligerent drunks. Earlier this year, Uber tested a program in Seattle where the rearview mirrors were pointed at the passengers. The hope was that if the riders could see themselves they’d behave better. Maybe Uber should consider a partnership with Snapchat.
To understand why this matters so much to publishers, it might help to have a quick history of the last decade of digital publishing. In short: Sometime around five years ago, Facebook turned on a fire hose of traffic aimed at media outlets by heavily promoting outside links to its hundreds of millions of News Feed users. This new audience was both enormous and addictive, and many publishers began to court it, writing headlines and assigning stories based at least in part on what Facebook’s audience, and Facebook’s distribution mechanisms, would reward. Forget Google, forget newsletters, forget home pages: At this point, Facebook provides anywhere from half to three-quarters (and often more) of many publishers’ monthly audiences.
There’s no similar good news in this announcement. There’s a millenarian argument to be made that Facebook cutting publishers off would be the long-term best thing for media. Certainly, it’s hard to make the argument that Facebook’s outsize role in the ecosystem has been good for media as a whole. But cleansing fires tend to burn down everything, not just the stuff you don’t like.
The problem has never been Facebook alone. It’s been that the internet so thoroughly upended the print-media business model that it’s going to take years to figure out whether print-style media can be self-sustainable in a world that changes this rapidly and this quickly. If there’s any solace for publishers here, it’s that the tweaks are a sign that Facebook is worried, too. The company is openly nervous that people are sharing less about themselves, and abandoning the News Feed — Facebook’s most profitable product — for seemingly more private social networks like Snapchat or Instagram (or even for private messaging groups). By promoting friends and family over brands and publishers, Facebook is hoping you’ll post more personal updates and photos — and thereby increase engagement. And if the cost of that is an entire industry? So be it.
If you want an unlocked Android phone for the rock-bottom price of $50, Amazon’s got just the gadget for you. There’s only one catch! You have to be willing to withstand the hot, white light of ads emanating from your phone every time you look at your lock screen.
Starting today, Amazon Prime members can purchase the BLU R1 HD or the Motorola Moto G at a discount. The BLU phone rings in at $49 and the Moto G at $149. (Which not for nothing makes both devices relatively reasonably priced for what they are and offer.) And unlike Amazon’s past forays into phones (remember the Fire phone?), these devices offer your typical suite of Google apps, like YouTube and Chrome. Still, there’s that whole ad thing to consider.
Truthfully, the best piece of tech I own, the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite, has ads. (It was $20 cheaper than the ad-free version, so naturally that was the one I picked.) And the ads don’t really bug me for the few seconds I see them when I flick the device on for a subway ride or a pre-bedtime chapter. But, as Gizmodo points out, you likely look at your phone screen a whole lot more frequently than you do an e-reader. (I write this as I look at my locked phone for a Bumble notification and to check the time.) And if you are checking your Kindle for the time, maybe you don’t need to buy a reduced-price phone. Maybe you just need to buy a watch.
Today, June 29, in the year of our lord (Justin Bieber), a new teen trend was born. And like the birth of most teen trends, another was left in its wake. So throw away your Deer Park water bottles and pick up a plastic chair, because chair flipping is the latest and greatest thing in teen entertainment these days.
It started with two students at Shirley Boys’ High School in Christchurch, New Zealand. Corban Baker and Cosmo Everett-Wells posted a video of them flipping plastic chairs during their lunch break, Stuff.co reports. The pair posted the video later that day and captioned it “what even is bottle flipping.” (In case teens aren’t your thing, in May a North Carolina high school senior went viral following a talent-show performance where he flipped a plastic water bottle to thunderous applause. Yes. Really.)
Since then, their Facebook video has been viewed almost 1.5 million times. And a version on Unilad’s Facebook page has been viewed another 22 million more. As for their moves, the pair said each flip they landed took about 20 takes and that Baker is the stronger chair-flipper of the duo. (He’s the one who isn’t wearing a scarf and lands that excellent move where the chair winds up back in a stack of other chairs.)
Fortunately for the pair, the school’s principal was cool with the whole viral video being filmed in a music room during lunch thing, calling it “ingenious,” and that the school would never “want to deny 10 million people the opportunity to have a laugh.” Which is good for guys, because unlike their very chill principal, I watched the whole thing screaming DON’T HURT THE GUITARS!
It’s called the Tap Strap, and it’s pretty cool, but may essentially require you to relearn typing.
Something called Unified Weapons Master is gaining popularity in Australia, and this is the three-layer carbon shell suit you wear to play it. It’s hard to tell if this sport is actually going to take off, since that armor gets in the way of a lot of, shall we say, dexterity. But hey, seems like it’s worth a shot? Watch the video and decide for yourself.
An email from the Obama campaign arrived in my in-box earlier today — one of those daily messages whose arrival has been a constant for nearly a decade. You never know who the sender will be these days — one day it’s Dr. Jill Biden; the next week, it will most certainly be J.R. Smith — but today’s was from the deputy digital director for Organizing for Action. And it’s the best email I’ve ever received from the Obama campaign. Let the record show that June 29, 2016, was a great day in political donation LISTSERV pop-culture-reference history. We’re going to be talking about this one for a while.
I’m genuinely loving this, but I’m getting the sense this isn’t just an email from an Aubrey fan sent out to the entire OFA mailing list. Surely there’s a catch?
We’ll go on in a moment, but I want you to remember that line: “Google ‘Drake’ and save yourself from this embarrassment.”
The email comes out the gate on fire, pure summertime-Santana “Smooth” levels of hot. The first line:
It goes on for a few more lines, followed by a link asking me to give five dollars — but I see the word Drizzy out the corner of my eye and can’t think about anything else. Oh yes, we’re about to bring it back home.
I read the line, and then read it again, and then read it again, and then read it 27 more times. “It’s never too late to realize … what you want in your life”? I scanned my embarrassingly large Drake lyrics bank, and nothing was registering. I tried to break it into bars, musically, incepting Drake’s voice into my head in an attempt to imagine a scenario in which he would say such a quote. Again, nothing.
BOOM.
Interesting.
It never occurred to me that the quote might not be real — of course Drake must have said it. This is an email from info@barackobama.com. There’s no way a fake Drake quote snuck its way into a donation LISTSERV email for the president of the United States of America. I’m pretty sure Obama himself fact-checks and copyedits all of these emails. There’s no way the gods would bless me in such a way, right? Impossible.
Nevertheless, I typed the quote into Google, expecting to find the line buried in a random song that either I forgot about, or that was on Views.
I clicked on the latter, which was hosted at the site wealthygorilla.com. There the quote was — number ten. (“Realize what you want in your life” links out to another site, lifehack.org, for a post titled “7 Ways To Find Out What You Really Want In Life.”)
Checking through the rest of the search results came up with similar sites — Drake motivational lyric pages, Tumblr posts, or people quoting the line in the course of personal social-media life, and attributing the statement to Drake. From there, I floated into the even more interesting world of Google Images, discovering the lovely piece of art you see here.
The first two: “25 of Drake’s Most Memorable Motivational Quotes” and “20 of the Best Drake Quotes That Inspire People.”
No results on lyrics sites. But that doesn’t mean there weren’t any results at all. Google found some sites that the quote appeared on.
Oh my God, I thought. Please tell me what I think happened actually happened. Please tell me someone searched “Drake Inspirational Quotes.” Please tell me when I search “Drake Inspirational Quotes,” one of those two blog posts come up.
If you were wondering, however, if a character named Father Kennedy in 2007 Sandra Bullock film Premonition says “It’s never too late to realize what’s important in your life, to fight for it” — well, yes, that did, in fact, happen.
Sometimes, life is perfect. And unless Drake is out here doing secret commencement addresses, Aubrey Drake Graham has never said “It’s never too late to realize what you want in your life, and it’s never wrong to fight for it.” And by “never,” I mean it’s possible that Drake has said this, sometimes, somewhere, perhaps over Gchat, and only spam motivational quotes sites know about it. But it doesn’t seem likely.
PLEASE.
There it is: “25 of Drake’s Most Memorable Motivational Quotes,” hosted by addicted2success.com.
And I couldn’t be happier — that a quote from a bad Sandra Bullock film was probably turned into a fake Drake spam meme quote that made its way into a donor email for Barack Obama. So happy, in fact, that I think I’ll finally donate some money. Thanks, Obama.
It’s almost the Fourth of July, which for many people means hot dogs, flag T-shirts, tweeting in earnest about America’s 2016th birthday — and beer pong. The game of our forefathers, frat guys, and our actual fathers when they want to seem cool. But traditional beer pong is so passé. Thanks to the advent of technology, today’s ping-pong-ball-throwing enthusiasts can play a much less primitive version of the game. All you need are a dozen Solo cups and two Roombas.
The video, which started circulating yesterday on Reddit, looks fun enough. I mean, who hasn’t dreamed of reliving their college days with the added thrill of potentially ruining two $900 devices with beer. (For what it’s worth, the cups in the video look like they’ve been stuck to the Roombas somehow to keep them from toppling over.) On the upside, if you do make a mess, at least you’ve got a vacuum handy.
In the name of the father, the son, and the holy Google Cardboard. Amen. Yesterday, a company called Bible-VR announced it was taking the scriptures into 2016 with a new virtual-reality app. The company says the app will work with multiple headsets, including Google Cardboard, and will include video shot in Israel and Morroco to give “realistic 3D simulations and perceptions of the Bible in the lands where it happened.”
From Bible-VR:
And while those Bible stories sound pleasant (even if they are dredging up all of my repressed nightmares of eight years spent in a plaid skort at Catholic school), here are a few other stories we think would make excellent fodder for an immersive VR experience.
Genesis 38
And you thought VR porn was the future! Get your Old Testament vibes on and watch as Onan, the second son of Judah, has sex with his dead brother’s wife to maintain the family lineage. But Onan changes his mind and at the last minute decides not to seal the deal. Instead, Onan is then killed by God for “spilling his seed.” The perfect story for scaring your kids out of masturbating.
Kings 2
Have you ever wanted to get up close and personal with bears as they maul 42 children to death? This one is for you. So the Bible says, some kids called the Prophet Elisha a “baldhead,” so he cursed them in the Lord’s name. And then two bears appeared and “tore” (read: murdered) the children for mocking Elisha. Be the bears! Be the children! Be the prophet Elisha and watch lovingly rendered realistic 3-D child gore!
Judges 3
The original your momma so fat, this tale features a man named Ehud who’s chosen by God to fight the fat King, Eglon, who has taken over Israel. Ehud visits Eglon, telling him he has a message from God to deliver. Except the message is actually just Ehud whipping out a sword and stabbing Eglon in his gut. The sword, with Eglon being so fat and all, is never seen again.
1 Samuel 18
Exodus 4
God decides to kill Moses because his son is uncircumcised. Fortunately, his wife saves the day by promptly slicing off their son’s foreskin and placing it lovingly atop Moses’ feet. Fun for the whole family in 3-D.
More foreskin fun! David wants to marry a woman named Michal, but her father, Saul, wants something in return: 100 foreskins in 24 hours. To really show his love, David kills twice as many men, collects what he needs from them and returns to Saul who gives Michal to David. And they all lived happily ever after, except for the 200 dead guys with missing foreskins. Think of the immersive experience!
They’re called omnidirectional wheels, and they have the potential to make parallel parking significantly less terrible. Unfortunately, there are no plans for them to hit the market anytime soon. But if they do, we can all stop making fools of ourselves trying to fit our big cars into tiny parking spaces. What I’m saying is, there’s hope.
This week, Apple and Spotify are going head to head over music streaming and profits after Spotify’s general counsel, Horacio Gutierrez, sent Apple a letter claiming Apple blocked the music-streaming company’s recent attempts to update its iOS app, “causing grave harm to Spotify and its customers,” Recode reports.
It’s a move designed to call attention to Spotify, but its complaint is one with broad ramifications. The crux of the issue is Apple’s billing system. If Spotify wants “to use the app to acquire new customers and sell subscriptions,” the company has to use Apple’s system at Apple’s price: an additional 30 percent fee for using the company’s billing system. (This is why a Spotify subscription purchased through the Apple store costs $13, rather than the usual $10. Those $3 cover Apple’s fees.)
Earlier this spring, Spotify brought back a promotion wherein users could purchase a three-month subscription priced at $0.99 per month — so long as they subscribed through the website and not through the Spotify iPhone app. The promotion has since been shut down, Spotify’s letter explained, because Apple threatened to kick Spotify out of the app store entirely if the deal was not discontinued. Spotify complied, but fired back by turning off the Apple billing system on the app. Hence, drama. “We cannot stand by as Apple uses the App Store approval process as a weapon.”
From Spotify:
Also there’s that whole “Spotify is Apple Music’s main competitor” thing.
In its broadest terms, this is a familiar fight, and one that will only get more familiar. As tech platforms at various levels — from hardware, to operating systems, to social media, to retail — increasingly dominate the tech economy, smaller businesses that want to operate on those platforms while also competing with certain features will always be held hostage by the terms of the giants. The terror and contempt with which digital publishers regard Facebook is different from Spotify’s anger with Apple only in degree, not in kind. If you want access to Apple’s (or Facebook’s, or Google’s) audience, you need to play by Apple’s (or Facebook’s, or Google’s) rules. And rule number one is: Don’t threaten our business.
Nearly 40,000 people will die in car accidents this year in the United States. But so far, only one of those people has died behind the wheel of a self-driving car. Yesterday, news broke about a 40-year-old man name Joshua Brown who was killed after his Tesla Model S — operating in the car’s beta “autopilot” mode — collided with a tractor-trailer in Florida earlier this spring. The trailer made a left turn and the Tesla’s brakes did not engage. Tesla says that “neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky,” so the brake was not applied.
But the technology isn’t perfect. According to the company, every Tesla “disables Autopilot by default and requires explicit acknowledgement that the system is new technology and still in a public beta phase before it can be enabled.” Tesla technology is known to have problems identifying tractor-trailers on the road and it’s possible that Brown also didn’t see the other vehicle in time, either. (The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is conducting a formal report on what happened in Florida.) But either way, Brown’s death is likely not going to be an isolated incident.
Self-driving cars conjure up images of a future in which everyone is a passenger. Drunk? Hop in and let your car safely get you home. Tired? Take a nap while your car minds the road. When Elon Musk introduced the Model S (the same model in which Brown died) he called the vehicle’s autopilot “probably better than a person right now.” This carries with it enormous potential safety benefits. Tesla says that there is one traditional car fatality for every 94 million miles driven, while Brown’s death is the first after 130 million miles driven in Teslas on autopilot.
But despite Musk’s glowing praise of his own product, the world isn’t quite there yet, because self-driving vehicles remain costly (an entry-level Tesla will run over $35,000) and because autopilot tech actually hasn’t evolved to that point yet. Even when autopilot is engaged, Tesla recommends drivers keep their hands on the wheel at all times. Instead, the roads remain a hodgepodge of traditional and smart cars. As Brown’s crash showed, this can cause major issues.
Brown, in the words of Tesla’s press release, “believed strongly in Tesla’s mission.” Before his death, he posted a YouTube video showing his Tesla swerving to avoid collision with a truck on the road. “I actually wasn’t watching that direction and Tessy (the name of my car) was on duty with autopilot engaged. I became aware of the danger when Tessy alerted me with the ‘immediately take over’ warning chime and the car swerving to the right to avoid the side collision,” he explained in the video’s caption.
Every death in a self-driving car will reinforce this feeling. And there will be others. Self-driving technology has the aura of inevitability, and while it exists in an abstract future, it feels like a wonderful dream. But as it moves from early adoption to wider use, and from “beta” to a less-hedged official feature, we’re going to have to confront the fact that “safer” doesn’t mean “perfect.”
Traditional car deaths, while always tragic, have become a relative norm. We know that whether we’re getting into Honda Civic or a Ford F-150 that driving is inherently dangerous. When people die in auto accidents, it’s shocking but not surprising. But humans have an inherent skepticism about new technologies and tend to, at the same time, overestimate their own abilities. No matter how safe you can be assured a self-driving car might be, a lifetime of being behind the wheel will lead you to believe that you have a better sense of the road than a car does. There’s a philosophical element to it, maybe — better to be in charge of your own destiny than leave it to a robot, even if the robot is technically better than you.
Internet illusions usually aren’t the most erudite concepts. A dress that looks different-colored depending on whom you ask. A dumb cigar shoved into a brick wall. Really nothing to write home about. (Though certainly something for everyone on the internet to blog about.) But for Kokichi Sugihara, optical trickery is nothing short of an art form. And also a science.
Unlike a Breathalyzer, this handy device can read your BAC in real time, based on the ethanol molecules that escape from your skin. Sometimes when you’re out partying it can be hard to gauge exactly how drunk you actually are. This little bit of wearable tech could take the guessing out of the equation and keep drunk people out of cars and off roads. That can’t be a bad thing. Watch the video above to see how it works.
Sugihara, a Japanese engineering professor, took second place at this year’s Best Illusion of the Year contest for his “Ambiguous Cylinder Illusion.” The illusion uses a set of cylinders and a mirror, with the cylinders cut so that depending on the angle from which you look at them, they appear to be either rounded or to have angled corners.
Now that is what I call an illusion. Eat it, pandas.
Previously, Amazon’s personal assistant, Alexa, could only be used to order a few basic items and to reorder things you had already purchased on the site (Think Alec Baldwin shouting at the machine to reorder him Brioni socks in those ads with Jason Schwartzman that aren’t at all annoying.) But today, that changes.
Now, people will be able to ask their devices to order from a range of millions of new products. Well, millions of new Prime-shipping-eligible products. (Which is good for Amazon’s business, but also good for you, because who doesn’t love free shipping and returns.) Just use those dulcet tones of yours to ask Alexa to order whatever your weird heart desires: paper towels, a fleet of drones, 42 copies of Lord of the Flies. The Amazon world is your oyster.
Unless you don’t own an Alexa, in which case you get to hang with the rest of us plebs who are still perusing Amazon-dot-com from a desktop running Windows 95.
Just sticking your phone in this pocket will give it a charge. Watch the video to find out how exactly this nifty little gadget works. So that’s it, you have now officially run out of excuses for why you didn’t text me back because your phone died, sorry.
Listen carefully. Do you hear that? That is the sound of hundreds of teens weeping into their hands desperate, but unable, to use Snapchat to send their friends pictures of their faces covered in puppy-dog ears.
Earlier today, Snapchat began experiencing user outages. (To be honest, I only noticed when I, too, went to send a dog snap and couldn’t.) The app was down for about 45 minutes, Quartz reports, and is back up and running now. But for just shy of an hour, Twitter was a war zone full of distressed and frantic teens.
Please pray for the teens in your life. They will need all the support they can get to overcome such a troubling time in their lives.
If “Adult VR Fest 01” was any indication of what’s to come for virtual reality, then we’d say the future looks pretty bright. The festival, held in Tokyo earlier this spring, was devoted (as you might guess) to all things VR porn, like this box engineered to feel exactly like you’re touching a boob.
To tide you over until then, maybe clear your mind with these virtual reality bible stories.
It looked like fun, too, if your idea of fun is getting a hand-job simulation from a robot while donning a VR headset in a room full of onlookers. Or, at least, it looked like fun until the whole event had to be shut down due to overcrowding. According to a VR blog, VR Talk, only about 20 people from the long line of people waiting to get in were allowed inside. “The event didn’t start until two p.m, so I went there in high spirits an hour before then, but the city was already overflowing with people. There were so many that it was almost impossible to keep the situation under control,” a reporter at the event noted on the blog. After that, Hatenablog reports the entire event had to be shuttered, but organizers have promised bigger accommodations for next year.
If you find yourself in San Francisco late at night and decide to break into Uber’s car-inspection lot, you won’t be chased down by security cop hightailing it after you on a Segway or an angry Doberman nipping at your heels. Instead, you’ll be followed and filmed by an egg-shaped “K5” robot.
The robots, built by a company called Knightscope, stand five feet tall and weigh in at 300 pounds, Fusion reports. Each is equipped with a 360-degree camera, a thermal camera, a laser range-finder, a weather sensor, license-plate-recognition abilities, features that allow it to record and accurately identify people, and laser blasters. (Okay, we made that last one up.) Uber only recently began using the robots, which work by alerting the company’s security team and recording every movement of a potential intruder.
K5 robot’s are rented for an hourly rate of seven dollars per. The company recommends renting two of the bots, so that one can charge while the other patrols. Or so that the robots can become friends, communicate, and help facilitate the inevitable robot takeover.
As gaming has ballooned into a billion-dollar industry over the last couple of decades, some of its most ardent supporters and earliest enthusiasts have begun to make a case for games not as a category of the entertainment industry, but as art. Video games are more than just very expensively produced software — this line of argument goes — they’re artistic works of evocative imagery, technical wizardry, themes, narratives, and sound.
Of course, when you get too carried away with that notion, you can lose sight of the fact that the video games are, at their core, pieces of software that execute in the same way that Microsoft Word does — and that video games’ software-ness, far from being a mark against them, can often make them more interesting. That’s one reason that I love Games Done Quick. GDQ is a round-the-clock “speed-running” marathon in which players finish video games as quickly as possible (while also raising money for charity). Players sit down and demonstrate and narrate how they are able to get from the beginning of a game to its end credits, in record time.
There are many different categories of speedrunning, but the default category, and arguably the most fascinating one, is called Any%.
In the course of playing through a game normally, a player would go through the sequence of levels as the game directs, fulfilling all of the requirements in order to get to the credits. This is, generally, known as 100 percent. Any% is the opposite, in that players can use whatever means necessary in order to get to the game’s finale. Almost always, this means finding ingenious ways to exploit a game’s systems or glitches in the code.
Exploiting glitches allows what is known as a sequence break — literally a break in the sequence of events that make up a game’s progression. Speedrunning Super Metroid, the quintessential game for this field, requires sequence breaking to complete in under an hour. According to the site Howlongtobeat.com, an average run is about seven and a half hours. (Donors to GDQ often reference killing or saving animals in their messages, a nod to the final sequence of Super Metroid in which you can either save animals and waste seconds, or leave them to die and get a better time.)
On a regular play-through, certain areas can’t be accessed without acquiring certain necessary items — so players develop new techniques not strictly intended by the game designers, like wall-jumping, or using bombs to get to otherwise inaccessible areas. Speedrunning is a hobby that can lead to impenetrable sentences like this, cribbed from the Metroid wiki entry on sequence breaking: “The Wall Jump can be used to collect Power Bombs before the Grapple Beam, the Wave Beam, Spazer Beam, X-Ray Scope, reach Kraid early, and get into the Wrecked Ship without the Grapple and thus collect an early Gravity Suit.”
Another popular tool of speedrunners is the warp, of which there are many types. There are death warps and save warps, which can move players to different locations in a game if they die or reload a save, respectively. And then there’s something known as the wrong warp, which is what allows runners to beat the classic Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, in 20 minutes. It involves confusing the game into spawning the player into the wrong level.
Here, just before the 16-minute mark, you can see well-known runner Cosmo warp from the game’s very first dungeon to its final boss by exploiting a glitch.
The captivating reason to watch Any% speedruns is not to see someone play the game extremely well as the developer intended, but to see them push the game’s software to its breaking point, finding the seams and ripping them open. Take, for instance, this speedrun of Fallout 3 — a game players can get lost in for hundreds of hours — being beaten in less than 15 minutes. The player clips out of the map — that is, he gets outside of the environment’s boundaries — and then “speedcripples” himself. In layman’s terms, getting injured gives players the ability to move faster for a short period of time, and the runner tricks the computer into giving him that boost permanently by reloading a save file quickly, multiple times.
(Finding small ways to move faster is a key part of speedrunning. It’s why Zelda players often hop to their destination facing backward, rather than running directly forward.)
It takes patience, skill, and tons of work to find all of these methods, and utilizing them requires a deep understanding of a game’s systems. This is apparent even in runs that don’t exploit glitches. Players occasionally perform maneuvers that are “frame perfect,” meaning they have only one frame of animation during which to execute it. Sometimes they’ll play blindfolded, as four people did last winter at the end of a six-hour marathon attaining 100-percent completion in Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask.
There’s no other competition like speedrunning. Basketball always has four quarters; baseball always has nine innings. If you want to win Monopoly, you have to buy Boardwalk. But in speedrunning, there are so many technical and design variables in play, so many different vectors from which to approach (or circumvent) a problem, that it comes together in a unique combination of ingenuity and physical dexterity. What it really is, to phrase it in a mawkish way, is a celebration of man over machine. A culmination of hours of study about how computers works, how code executes, and how its flaws can be used to one’s own advantage.
A full GDQ schedule can be found here, but some upcoming highlights today include a Castlevania block all afternoon and a 41-minute run of Super Meat Boy at 8:24.
Etch A Sketches have carved out a special place in the hearts of all who encountered them. If they’re known for anything, it’s their versatility. But we’re willing to bet hacking the thing and turning it into a weird but slightly amazing analog clock was not in the original plan. Enter the EtchABot, which now lets you use an Etch A Sketch to tell time. Thank you, technological people in this world with too much time on your hands, thank you.
Harrowing news today, so I hope you’re sitting down. According to The Wall Street Journal, old people are using Snapchat.
I’ll give you a second to catch your breath. The ancient ones — who have kids of their own, enjoy leaving voice mail, and say words like 401(k) — are signing up for Snapchat, despite the fact that their hips may shatter at any moment.
According to the Journal, Snapchat’s over-35 user base is currently 14 percent of its total, and growing quickly. Three years ago, that number was 2 percent. (Comparatively, the 18–24 demo covers 67.5 percent of Snapchat users.)
This is, to be sure, terrifying. Imagine getting a Snapchat video about auto insurance or a light sweater from some dude who thought the video for Dire Straits’s “Money for Nothing” was cutting edge.
But it is hardly surprising. Here is how the Journal accurately describes Snapchat:
Okay, now replace “Snapchat” with “Facebook” and what you’re left with is a sentence from any social-media article written in 2009.
This is the tech life cycle. Teens, adolescents, college kids, and anyone else with a surplus of free time adopt new social networks uninhabited by their parents, and then those networks grow corpulent enough to attract the parents. And then a new network comes along and all the young people go there. So, bad news: Your mom is going to be lip-syncing Celine Dion on Musical.ly in three years.
Over the weekend, while most people were busy Instagramming subpar pictures of fireworks, Snapchat quietly rolled out a game-changing lens. It is, one might say, the best thing since sliced bread.
Like the filtered version of the classic breakfast dish called eggs in a basket, the new lens sticks the user’s face in a hole in the center of the slice and adds a few Snapchat classics like giant eyeballs and rosy cheeks as well. It’s everything you want out of a Snapchat filter: silly, janky, more than a little odd — but not so odd you don’t look cute. There have been rumblings on Twitter that the slice could dethrone the current reigning king of Snapchat lenses, the puppy. Finally, a new, wonderful meme!
But nothing is new on the internet. Those of us a bit longer in the tooth than the youthful masses of Snapchat recognize the filter’s striking similarity to a meme from 2012, which involved placing actual slices of bread over the heads of unsuspecting cats. Yes, long-time meme followers, we’re talking about “breading,” the non-trend forced into memedom by Gawker’s Adrian Chen on a particularly traffic-hungry day, and then summarily killed at his hand. As Chen wrote the same week he created the meme:
In case you’re worried you’ve missed an important element of the meme, or the story, you haven’t. A blogger looking to get page views made a big, ironic, meta joke about cats with slices of bread stuck on their heads, and now, four years later, it’s the coolest filter on the coolest social-media app.
“All I have to say is I’m happy breading continues to bring joy to people after all these years,” Chen told Select All when asked about the new meme.
And then Tesla founder Elon Musk himself got involved.
Given that a significant component of Tesla’s appeal is the potential safety benefits (and cool factor) of its highly touted autopilot system (which is still, remember, in beta mode), it’s at least worth asking why the company did not feel the need to tell investors and buyers about the Florida crash. Which is all that Loomis wanted to do when she began an email conversation with a Tesla PR exec.
From Fortune:
Last week, news broke of the first fatal car crash involving a Tesla running in autopilot mode. But while the world only just learned about the accident, which killed a 40-year-old man in Florida, the accident itself occurred in May — a potentially material piece of information, first noted by Fortune’s Carol Loomis, that Tesla did not disclose to its investors at the time.
Musk wasn’t done. When Fortune editor Alan Murray tweeted the story, Musk replied with another zinger, clearly displeased that the publication had run the story despite his impassioned pleas for bloody math.
The incensed-CEO-directly-contacting-reporters is a tech-industry trope dating back at least to Steve Jobs, who’d famously reply to personal emails with blunt answers to reporters. But what felt somewhat refreshing five years ago has become tiresome as Silicon Valley has emerged as an economic and political power to rival any other industry (or institution) on the planet. Musk’s not wrong — traditional cars and their traditional human drivers are likely a bigger danger than their self-driving counterparts — though, as a math teacher might say, show your work. But wildly flailing at reporters doing their jobs no longer feels like a democratic bypass of multiple layers of spin and publicity. Instead, it comes across as desperate and insecure: an immensely powerful man objecting to legitimate questions (on a holiday weekend, no less). The power imbalance between the tech industry and the media industry has become too glaring for CEO-versus-reporter tête-à-têtes to seem anything but pathetic.
And why would he respond, anyway? As a rep from Tesla’s PR team also pointed out to Fortune, after news of the crash broke last week, Tesla stock dropped only temporarily before rising back up to a price of $216 per share. A price $4 higher than the stock was before the Autopilot crash made headlines. The company (which Musk has claimed could be worth over $700 billion by 2025) wasn’t exactly hurting for money. And now, it’s not hurting for unnecessary bad press either.
Sweden just opened the world’s first electric highway as part of a two-year trial funded by Siemens and Scania. If it works, it could save money, produce fewer emissions, and completely revolutionize the trucking industry. That is, if you’re cool with driving a truck constantly connected to long, electric cables the whole time as you zip down the highway. (Pretty safe guess that most truck drivers won’t love that.) See it for yourself in the video above.
Is there anything more satisfying than watching a laser beam burn up the sugary deposits encrusted on a used baking sheet, leaving behind a surface so shiny and smooth you could groom yourself in it? Not for anyone who loves cleaning. You’d better hold on to something because watching this video is very, very satisfying.
The news of the Classic’s demise comes on the heels of news that the U.S. Senate will no longer support BlackBerry devices. Once the legislative body exhausts the current supply of 600 or so, that’s it. The BlackBerry, once a sign of elite Beltway power players, is now a symbol of stodginess and obsolescence.
“It has been an incredible workhorse device for customers, exceeding all expectations,” COO Ralph Pini wrote in a blog post. “But, the Classic has long surpassed the average lifespan for a smartphone in today’s market.”
BlackBerry has decided to end the production of its Classic model, closing the curtain on the company’s golden age as it continues the lengthy transition to also-ran in the crowded smartphone market.
The decision to end production leaves their touch-screen Passport as the only in-production model running the BB10 operating system. BlackBerry is now in the process of moving its platform over to Android.
Today, President Obama joined Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail, speaking on Clinton’s behalf at a stop in North Carolina. This is great, especially if your name is Hillary Clinton and you would like to be president. But in between saying what I’m sure were glowing things about Mrs. Clinton, Obama instead slipped in this vitally important piece of news: Sasha Obama has a Twitter. Repeat: Sasha Obama, youngest Obama daughter and noted Cool Teen, has a Twitter.
The Classic model, introduced in 2013, was a throwback to the raised-button physical keyboards on older BlackBerry models, a feature that early smartphone adopters loved. Many preferred it to the more finicky touch-screen keyboards on iOS and Android.
The bomb was dropped during a dig at Donald Trump’s tweets. “Everybody can tweet, but nobody actually knows what it takes to do the job until you’ve sat behind the desk,” Obama said, as transcribed by The Guardian. “I mean, Sasha tweets, but she doesn’t think that she thereby should be sitting behind the desk!”
Sasha tweets! As you live and breathe! Now we can only hope her content is as good as that time Malia took a selfie in a Pro Era shirt (which was subsequently leaked on Instagram) and that her handle is something super chill. If you, too, are furiously trying to find the name the littlest Obama is tweeting under, let Select All help you out and confirm it is none of these: @SashaOMGTweets, @MyOtherRideIsAirForceOne, @IPinkyPromiseThisIsSashaObama, @SashaObamaProbs, or @XOXOSashipGirl.
There comes a time in your life when a traditional selfie just isn’t enough, when the craned arm and cocked head feels passé. So in that moment why not, like, purchase a ROAM-e selfie-taking drone that follows you around and snaps photos, freeing you up for things that its creators think young people like to do, like break-dancing and warehouse bike tricks?
For three days every summer, Anaheim, California, a city founded on grapes, oranges, and walnuts, becomes the youth capital of the world. No, not because of Minnie and Mickey at Disneyland: The hordes of teenagers who descend on Orange County are hoping to snag a selfie with Tyler Oakley or Shane Dawson at VidCon, a yearly conference gathering the biggest stars of YouTube, Vine, Musical.ly — and their fans.
Twenty-five-thousand people packed the Anaheim Convention Center this year: branded booths and lavish lounges stuffed with suits and stilettos click-clacking past starry-eyed tweens in crop tops and short shorts, clutching iPhones as their parents’ eyes bulge at the approaching vanguard. Budding Biebers and inchoate Instagram stars, sultry Snapchatters, youthful YouTubers, titillating tweeters, all there. And since most attendees aren’t old enough to have their own bank accounts, let alone drive, there’s a whole lot of parents.
None were more out of place than the dads. I saw all types of fathers at VidCon. Some kept their heads down, watching their phones, or the floor. Some out of breath, sweating, a few steps from a noble death in the heat of battle. Others congregated en masse, like members of a herd of ruminants who’d found water. A few seemed as excited as their kids — most looked terrified.
The dada diaspora couldn’t have been more perfect than it was in the Kia Parent’s Lounge, an open area next to a booming soundstage, with nothing but flimsy black curtains for protection. More like a holding pen than a lounge, this is where parents recharge their phones. And themselves. Some sat on the weathered carpet, scrolling through emails, texting missing kids: Where are you?? Some played video games, legs folded, time-warped back to childhood. Retro Pac-Man on a flat screen. A few feet away, Nintendo 64. Mario Kart was still a winner, battle mode blasting. “Yes!” screamed a dad.
In the middle of the circus sat a white Kia Sportage, a 30-something in cargo shorts and thong sandals inspecting it as if he were casing a bank. “Can you win it?” I asked. “No,” he tells me. “You can’t win it.”
This is how I met Nathan, a registered nurse from Sacramento, at VidCon with his wife, Marie, a bookkeeper for the state. They drove down with their 14- and 10-year-old girls for three days at VidCon, before going to Disneyland.
So what does a parent trip to VidCon entail? “We walk around, get free shit, and people-watch,” Marie told me. “This is summer vacation,” Nathan said, though “it’s expensive,” Marie explained. (Their kids saved money earned from chores and odd jobs — the only way the family could make their first VidCon work.) And a bit confusing. “They should have parents’ education class,” Nathan suggested. “It’d be good to know what to do and see, a guide to dos and don’ts.” “I want to know what my kids are so excited about,” said Marie, nodding.
Marie had another suggestion: “It would be nice if they served alcohol. The only way to make this fun would be if they served mimosas.” Would they come back next year? “If I had free time, I would be drinking,” Marie said. “Not here.”
Near the Pac-Man arcades I found a man in a power wheelchair in a “USA” T-shirt, accompanied by a woman carrying an iPhone, an iced coffee, with a when-will-it-be-over look on her face. Buddy and Krista Gray came from Modesto, California, with their 15-year-old and 18-year-old boys. “It’s our son’s passion,” Buddy, a retired minister, told me. “Our son wants to be a YouTuber. He’s just starting.”
“We want to support him,” added Krista. “But he’s 15, so things are changing a lot. It’s unreal that YouTubers make millions on homemade video. We want our son to see exactly what’s out here — just how big the horizon is.”
It’s an enormous horizon. Young people watch more online video than cable. This shift — and the ballooning ad budgets that go with it — means it takes an enormous amount of money just to get in the building, so to speak. And like many people I speak with, the Grays are floored by how much it costs to be good parents in the YouTube economy. If their kids wanted to quit school? “I would panic,” Krista said, laughing. Her work as a registered nurse helped support the family in lean times, she said, through a move from Texas. This struggling family is stretching what little they have — and feeling it.
“Tickets alone were, say, $600 bucks for four, our hotel for the week is $1,200, three days at Disneyland is another $750,” Buddy calculated. “On top of that, couple hundred in gas. And occasionally we have to eat. It’s about $50 a meal round here.”
What about families on the other side? The ones building this machine? I happened upon one such dad-daughter combo while on a tour of the convention center. Michael Boychuk is the executive creative director for Amazon — a very big deal. But at VidCon he looked sheepish next to his daughter Katya, who’s not even in high school. Boychuk told me he relies on her to figure out trends, and what’s next: “I look for her to point me in the right direction. Famous isn’t what it used to be.”
I ran across another dad-daughter combo — the journalism professor and pundit Jeff Jarvis, who brought his daughter this year after getting in a lot of trouble for attending solo last year. “It’s not about video or content, it’s about relationships, how people understand and relate to these stars,” he told me. “I learned that through my daughter. Wall-to-wall screaming girls, I’m the invader. I don’t belong here.”
“At the first VidCon, seven years ago, you had a lot of confused parents walking around,” Dan Weinstein, the president of Studio71, which produces, develops, and distributes videos to the tune of five billion monthly views, told me. “Why did my kid make me wait in line for three hours to get an autograph from some other kid? Now, I don’t think there’s as much confusion. It’s proliferated enough into pop culture. YouTube stars are on Ellen, Good Morning America. The phenomenon is at least intellectualized.”
Of course, while people like Weinstein and Boychuk help crank the machine, no one is closer to the sausage than the actual stars. This year I managed to run into Daddy Fun Pack, who may be the ultimate dad of VidCon. With the help of his wife, Kristine, and their five kids, Daddy Fun Pack has turned his family into the most-watched on YouTube — at almost three million subscribers.
“I was a full-time math teacher up until a few months ago,” the 37-year-old patriarch, whose real name is Matt, told me. “My wife was a piano teacher. In the last year, we’ve cut back on all of that.”
They posted a video of their twins back at the end of 2011, “just so my parents could see their grandkids, and people started watching. Suddenly, it had 10,000 views. Whoa! This is crazy, strangers are watching our kids. We were going to take it down or make it private; we didn’t know how YouTube works. Then it just kept growing. Pretty soon it had a million views. From there, we started thinking, what else could we do?”
Daddy Fun Pack says it took a few years to get real traction, and he’s since honed his business sense. School, voice lessons, piano practice for the kids, “we don’t film every single day,” he says, but it is work, and the whole family’s in it together.
As you read this, over 100 brown bears are arriving in Katmai National Park in Alaska. Their purpose? To paw through the Brooks River in search of fish — and not just any fish, but sockeye salmon. The pink fish of kings. And while usually I’d say such a natural and beautiful process should be left untouched by the sticky hands of man and technology, four years ago some genius decided to livestream the river 24/7 while the bears fed. And it was great.
This year, the tradition continues. You can watch the river round the clock as the bears splash around, hunt for food, and stumble sated back into the woods. The live camera feed jumps from several different vantage points, so you’re sure not to miss the action. And even when the bears aren’t around, the flowing river becomes the most calming screensaver this side of Windows 95. It’s fun for the whole family. Unless you come from a family of salmon. In which case, it’s probably less fun.
With its vast kingdom of server farms and its army of great engineers, Facebook can crunch an almost incomprehensible amount of data at similarly incomprehensible speeds. The thing is: You (the user) don’t like it. The speed at which Facebook undertakes certain tasks, such as its “security check,” makes users uneasy, so the company serves up loading screens and progress reports, even though all of the number-crunching has already happened.
Facebook even confirmed as much to Fast Company, stating that “[w]hile our systems perform these checks at a much faster speed than people can actually see, it’s important that they understand what we do behind the scenes to protect their Facebook account.” The reason for the slowdown was to walk people through whatever process was being executed and make sure that they understood what was happening.
Many services online use similar tactics, using progress bars and spinning pinwheels to make processes appear to take longer. In other words, we’ve reached a point where computers works faster than human brains. Even if systems get faster and better at analyzing data or serving up requests, there is a limit to how much we trust them. We like to see the work being performed, even if it happens in one tenth of the blink of an eye.
“Artificial waiting,” as it’s known, is employed for plenty of instantaneous functions like “checking credit” or “comparing prices” or “reticulating splines.” It makes users feel more comfortable to think that a lot of work is happening behind the scenes even though load times are quickly becoming a thing of the past for everything that’s not video.
So the next time you see a progress bar, have fun wondering whether the computer is actually working, or whether it’s taunting your dumb idiot human brain.
Picture this: You’re on vacation, sitting on a sandy beach somewhere, and you think to yourself, I should really let all my internet friends see where I’m at right now (or, depending on how at peace you are, I should really make all my friends jealous). You could share a perfectly square picture on Instagram, sure, or Boomerang a cutesy video — and there’s always Snapchat. But if you really want to show off this beach for more than a few, fleeting seconds — and if you really want to show off the whole beach — Facebook’s got the best possible option: the 360-degree photograph.
Facebook’s 360-degree photographs, which you may have seen pop up on your feed over the weekend, allow you to see up to a 360-degree view. But rather than squint at a panoramic photo squeezed onto your tiny phone, Facebook’s app makes use of the phone’s motion sensors, moving through the photo as you move your phone. If you tilt your phone left, you can see the left of the photo; tilt it right, you swing the view around. (On the desktop, the 360-degree photo is easy to look at just by dragging through it.)
Step 1: Take a panoramic picture as you usually would, slowly and steadily filming your subject so everything lines up and you don’t end up with six-headed humans in your shot. (Unless that’s the effect you’re going for.)
Step 2: Caption and upload to Facebook like you would any regular image. That’s it. Your friends on new-enough phones will be able to see and engage with the image in 360 degrees, and everyone should be able to see the photo in 360 degrees on desktop.
Lucky for you, 360-degree photos are actually fairly easy to post on Facebook. You don’t need any special software or photo-editing skills: just a smartphone camera with a built-in panorama mode. (Android and iPhone users, this is very easy for you.) Facebook supports a decently big list of devices, including every iPhone since the 4S. (You can find a complete list here.)
If you want to take your photography to the next level, or at least the next price bracket, you can also purchase cameras specifically engineered for shooting in 360. The Ricoh Theta S will run you about $350 and meets Facebook’s requirements. Which seems like a bit of a high price tag just to show your friends a few more degrees of your vacation. But hey, whatever works.
A word of warning, Facebook requires an image be at least 100 degrees wide in order for this feature to work, but there doesn’t seem to be any way to find out if an image is big enough before you upload it. You’ll have to go with trial and error for now, so you might want to take a few different panos to make sure you’ve got one that will work.
Calvin and Hobbes was a huge part of many of our childhoods, but it’s likely not something you’ve thought about in years. This artist is trying to change that with this crazy 3-D version of the classic comic strip. You can twist it, turn it, zoom in and out. Everything you never thought you would want to do with a two-dimensional comic. Take a look.
Today, Snapchat announced a new feature called “Memories,” which, as the name implies, provides a more permanent record of user activity on Snapchat. Users can file their photos and videos away to the Memories section, where the posts are stored in the cloud and can be viewed and inserted into future messages and stories.
Here is an extremely West Coast video that vaguely conveys the feature.
It’s a way to reuse and remix snaps into new messages and narratives. Snaps older than a day will appear in a frame clearly marking them as such, but you’ll still be able to add geofilters and stickers, even if you’re in a complete different locale. So you can make everyone jealous of your vacation after you get back. Memories also has a passcode-locked vault called My Eyes Only where you can save sensitive (read: nude) images whenever you want to pass around your phone.
With Memories, users can upload and post anything from their camera rolls to Stories. For many users, this might be a nice addition offering them more flexibility, but it also introduces the danger of turning Snapchat into, well, everyone else — another repository for you to upload photos and videos to, with some cutesy filters and emoji captions.
This is all well and good, but it’s also easy to see it as a dilution of some of Snapchat’s core principles — the same principles that have made it such an appealing alternative to social-media behemoths like Facebook. What is the appeal of a Snapchat that lets users save and send snaps at times other than “in the moment”? A primary feature of Snapchat is that you’re seeing things that were taken and uploaded as they happened, because Stories expire in 24 hours.
Worse, along with your friends’ concert snaps, you can expect accounts called things like “GreatVines” hawking watermarked freebooted videos from Vine or Instagram or ESPN. By letting users import the aesthetics of other social networks, Snapchat risks diluting its own distinct look and feel.
Whether or not that happens is up to users, and Snapchat’s lack of outside sharing or discoverability certainly bottlenecks that effect more than other visual networks like Instagram and Tumblr. But the main concern remains: What separates Snapchat from all of the other places where you can upload and store photos? The answer is probably “not much.”
If someone offers to buy you lunch, say a slice of pizza, it’s socially acceptable to say yes. But to decline, only to eat an unoffered bite from your friend’s plate minutes later, is an act of savagery. Just ask Arize Ifejika, who made the mistake of sniping a slice from his friend De’ja earlier this week.
YouTuber TechRax knows a thing (or six) about ruining perfectly good iPhones with household objects like lava lamps, crayons, and even a plump Thanksgiving turkey.
“I don’t want to share anything that I’m digesting,” De’ja says in one of the clips, after she purchases herself an entirely new slice of pizza.
De’ja didn’t take to kindly to Ifejika just helping himself and proceeded to loudly tell him all the reasons why. Which, naturally, Ifejika recorded on Snapchat and later shared with the world via Twitter. The video, a compilation of several saved snaps, has been retweeted by more than 30,000 people since it was posted yesterday.
De’ja also followed up with a text message to Ifejika explaining, again, that she would have gladly bought him a slice if only he’d mentioned he was “starving like a homeless pig.” Again, Ifejika shared this on Twitter to the tune of 12,000 retweets.
Since then, hundreds of people have weighed in on whether or not De’ja’s reaction was warranted. “I’m hi-key with her on this,” wrote one person. “I would’ve ate that piece of a pizza and made him buy me another,”countered another.
Either way, brands have also discovered this thread, so it will only be fun for a little while longer. Get it while it’s still hot.
As the dust and hangovers from the Fourth of July settle and Instagram’s algorithm finally starts showing you pictures you want to see from last weekend, you might start to notice a trend: video. Specifically, video produced using Instagram’s sister app, Boomerang, which works by taking a number of photos in rapid succession and then cutting them together into a GIF loop, resulting in your newsfeed filling with two-second clips of your friends doing cannonballs into pools, eating mustard-laden hot dogs, and watching fireworks. Lots and lots of them.
Instagram tells Select All the company saw a significant increase in video posts on Monday, July 4. Compared to the previous Monday, video production on the app was up by 26 percent. And while that’s a decent jump, it’s likely many social platforms (like Instagram’s video-obsessed parent company, Facebook) also saw a spike in video shares as a result of the holiday. The bigger number is that, Instagram says, Boomerang video production jumped by 157 percent compared to the previous week. (Full disclosure, I used Boomerang to post twice this weekend.)
In case you’re not familiar, Boomerang works best for shooting images that might be difficult to get in focus or in the frame with a traditional still photo. (Fireworks, your uncle about to do a belly flop, pretty much anything in midair fits the bill.) With that in mind, it’s not surprising that Instagram’s short-video maker was the app of choice this weekend. A big part of why Boomerang is fun is because it’s easy to use and if you haven’t seen it before, the finished product looks pretty impressive. Like you spent a lot of time and effort getting that video just right. When in reality, the app, with its more limited editing options, might actually be simpler to use than Instagram. Either way, Boomerang definitely had a moment last weekend, which means it probably won’t be long until people get bored and start looking for a different way to create Instagram posts. Which means, Instagram, if you’re listening, you have just under a year to come up with something new and cool for 2017.
Microsoft is looking for the best, the brightest, and the most bae. According to a recruiting email shared on Twitter by one potential bae, the company sent out a call to interns in the Bay Area with an invite to a Microsoft party in San Francisco promising “hella noms, lots of dranks,” and “Yammer beer pong tables.” An “Internapalooza,” the email promised.
Nearly 3,000 people have retweeted the colorful (literally, just check out those neon Microsoft Word fonts, that’ll definitely bring in the cool interns) email since it was posted online Tuesday. For its part, Microsoft says “the email was poorly worded and not in keeping with our values as a company” and it is “looking into how this occurred and will take appropriate steps to address it,” Gizmodo reports.
But on the other hand, that email is grabby as hell and if I was an intern spending a summer in a new city, I’m pretty sure I’d be down for a free party courtesy of one of the largest tech giants in Silicon Valley. Internapalooza is scheduled for July 11 and Microsoft, if you’re still having trouble filling the guest list, Select All would be happy to join you for some drinks and noms and pong.
Pokémon Go uses your phone’s GPS and camera to place Pokémon in everyday situations. Sounds fun, but also potentially hazardous. Already, Australian authorities have had to caution users against entering a police station that appears on the app to be a hunting location. Proceed with caution, Ash Ketchum wannabes.
Think back to December 2015 — a time when children gliding on freshly unwrapped hoverboards roamed wild and free throughout suburbia. When dads were breaking bones left and right trying to keep up. When young girls turned into seals trying to save their beloved boards from sinking to the bottoms of pools. And, oh yeah, when hoverboards were overheating and lighting themselves on fire. Again, and again, and again.
Now, the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission is recalling over half a million hoverboards, citing the potential for personal and property damage. (You know, like your kids lighting the house, or themselves, on fire.) “There have been at least 99 incidents reports of the battery packs in self-balancing scooters/hoverboards overheating, sparking, smoking, catching fire and/or exploding including reports of burn injuries and property damage,” the CPSC explained in the recall.
CPSC has also provided a list of all devices affected by the recall. The top offender, popular hoverboard brand Swagway, will be recalling over 260,000 units, more than half the total recall. To see whether you or your teen is still riding around on a battery-powered piece of kindling, you can see the full list here.
Earlier this week, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the conviction of David Nosal, a man who used a colleague’s log-in credentials to access the databases of research firm Korn Ferry. Nosal’s conviction falls under the archaic Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which makes “unauthorized” access of computers a federal crime.
If the idea of unauthorized access sounds vague to you, that’s because it is. Prosecutors love the CFAA, written three decades ago, because they can classify a broad range of computer activity we now consider normal as criminal — activity like sharing passwords. Services like Netflix and HBO Go have taken a hands-off approach to account sharing, but every one of these court cases makes what is now normalized computer usage a more precarious concern.
Punishment under the CFAA can be severe. Threatened with the prospect of years in jail for downloading millions of articles from JSTOR, the nonprofit digital library, cyberactivist Aaron Swartz committed suicide in 2013. This past spring, journalist Matthew Keys was sentenced to two years in prison for providing his Tribune Media log-in credentials to vandals who changed a Los Angeles Times headline for less than an hour.
The thing about the CFAA vagueness is that, as Motherboard emphasizes, it doesn’t specify who gets to decide what is and is not unauthorized. In Nosal’s case, his employer had not authorized his access, but the person who provided their own password instead did so willingly. An imperfect analogy: Your landlord says you can’t list your apartment on Airbnb, but you do so anyway. Is your guest authorized to stay in your place?
In a dissenting opinion, Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote that the possible precedent is a dangerous one, given how people use computers today.
He later added:
It comes down to a question of who can grant access, the platform holder or the individual user? The answer is still up in the air. One thing that’s definitely clear, however, is that courts shouldn’t be making the decision using a law older than the World Wide Web itself.
If you’re going to read the comments, this is the way to do it.
This week, two big things happened in the geek community: Advanced Placement test scores were released and the Pokémon Go augmented-reality game debuted on iOS. Besides sharing the same level of international gravitas, the game and the AP scores are similar in that they were released in geographic waves. Before it was available in the U.S., Pokémon Go was downloadable in other parts of the world. Similarly, students in some states got their AP scores before students in others, theoretically to avoid crashing the College Board website. In the past, as noted by Motherboard’s Jason Koebler, students have skirted these restrictions by using virtual private networks, better known as VPNs, which allow you, among other things, to fool an app or website into believing you’re accessing it from another location. (Thus letting a kid in New Jersey find out he did not ace BC Calculus at the same time as a kid in Oregon does.)
This week, searches for VPNs started trending in the Apple app store. But Koebler ventures it’s not panicked high schoolers who are searching for them, but rather frantic gamers hungry to start playing Pokémon Go. (A group which likely includes some crossover from the aforementioned panicked high schoolers.)
From Motherboard:
Though it turns out the VPN trick didn’t actually let you skirt Pokémon Go’s download restrictions, it seems likely that many people gave it the old college try anyway. (Meanwhile, high schoolers were using the trick to see if they were ever going to be able to get into college.) Since Pokémon Go is played using your GPS location as you try to, um, catch ‘em all, a VPN could also let players track down Pokémon they wouldn’t otherwise be able to see in their area. Though as more and more people report glitches with the game, it seems like at this point many gamers would settle for just being able to log in and catch a few Pokémon in their own neighborhood, as the Lord intended.
Your iPhone’s built-in “zoom” function sucks, in most ways. Digital zoom — which “zooms” simply by enlarging and cropping the image, rather than using lenses — is a half-measure that produces an inferior image, and no self-respecting photographer or videographer would use it. That is what I used to believe, and occasionally still do. And yet, as often happens, the janky, inferior digital product has revealed itself to be interesting in ways that I didn’t anticipate at first. Maybe digital zoom isn’t so bad after all.
For still images, I steadfastly believe that digital zoom is a waste. It artificially enlarges an image without increasing detail. You’re better off not using it and then manually cropping it later.
If you own a smartphone and no other dedicated camera, you might just think of digital zoom as, well, zoom. But it’s fundamentally different from its forebear, optical zoom. Optical zoom physically repositions parts of a camera lens to enlarge and enhance the image’s resolution. Digital zoom increases size but not resolution. Think of it this way: If you had an image that 400 pixels wide, and stretched it to 800 pixels wide, you wouldn’t be able to magically see more detail.
For video, on the other hand, I’ve grown to love digital zoom. Not to kill the frog, but it adds an extra layer to a lot of great Vines — a stuttering, abrupt movement that emphasizes and exaggerates stupid internet jokes. Like this one!
In old-school filmmaking, using zoom is by and large something to avoid. Cinematographers prefer to move the camera through space, so that perspective changes and objects are displaced. When a filmmaker uses zoom, the viewer becomes aware that they are watching from a distant, stationary position. This breaks immersion and reminds the audience that that they’re watching a film.
Digital zoom does so to an even greater degree than optical zoom, because it also decreases the sharpness and quality of the image. The effect draws attention to the viewer’s distance from their subject. Digital zoom is kind of like someone craning their neck to see better, but not getting a much better view. And yet in video formats native to social media — your Vines, your Instagrams, what have you — zoom is prolific.
Partly this is just because it’s easy to use. But digital zoom also adds a split-second movement to video that is, in my mind, incomparable. It’s almost imperceptible but it’s there, and you sense it, even if you don’t know it. The zoom on this now-classic Vine by chloe lmao is only three frames long.
It’s sort of like a jump cut, abrupt in a similar way, but for a few frames, you can see subjects gradually getting larger or smaller, calling attention to the camera operator themselves. The stuttering, unsteady progression of a digital zoom is distinctly human in 2016 in the way that the shaky-cam aesthetic was a decade ago.
There are other details of digital zoom that add to this effect. As the zoom happens, encoding artifacts grow and dance across the frame. The CSI-style “zoom in and enhance” doesn’t happen on consumer products, certainly not to the extent that pop culture has taught us. It becomes impossible to divorce the subjects in the footage from the way in which it was captured: via a smartphone.
Even as smartphone cameras gain in fidelity and resolution, the unsteady, abrupt (and arguably amateur) digital zoom will proliferate, because the process is inherently flawed — it simply enlarges pixels without capturing more detail. But thinking of digital zoom solely in comparison to optical zoom is a poor way of framing it. As Brian Eno once wrote, “Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature.”
Digital zoom is a technique and a visual trick that’s a product of its time — one in which anyone can act on their creativity withing having to pay lip service to the traditional way that films used to be made. Digital zoom works in ways optical zoom never could, but in order to see that I needed to reframe the technique not as an approximation of old ones, but an entirely new one instead.
Elizabeth Holmes, lover of black turtlenecks and CEO of blood-testing start-up Theranos, has been officially banned by U.S. regulators with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from operating a medical lab for at least the next two years. And while that may seem like a small punishment to those of us who have never planned to, and don’t intend to, operate medical labs, it isn’t great news for someone whose entire business model centers on being able to own and operate a medical lab.
In the latest — and maybe last — chapter in Theranos’s extended fall from grace, the company will be shuttering its Newark, California, operation entirely starting in 60 days. (Patient testing at the facility has already ceased, but the company’s Arizona lab remains operational, Tech Crunch reports.)
“We accept full responsibility for the issues at our laboratory in Newark, California, and have already worked to undertake comprehensive remedial actions. Those actions include shutting down and subsequently rebuilding the Newark lab from the ground up, rebuilding quality systems, adding highly experienced leadership, personnel and experts, and implementing enhanced quality and training procedures,” Holmes said in a company statement.
Theranos, a company Holmes founded at age 19 after dropping out of Stanford, has spent the last year tumbling from a $9 billion valuation to an object lesson in bio-tech hubris. Following skepticism from former employees that the Theranos blood-testing technology actually works as the company claims it does, The Wall Street Journal ran a number of stories discrediting the company and disputing its claims. Since then — despite the protests of prominent Silicon Valley executives and investors — Theranos has lost its COO, an important corporate partnership with Walgreens, and, well, its reputation. (Oh, and then there’s that ongoing federal criminal investigation as well.) Thursday’s regulator censure also comes with an undisclosed civil money penalty. Here’s hoping Holmes can afford to pay it: Earlier in June, Forbes reestimated her net worth, knocking it from $4.5 billion to zero.
The new iPhone is rumored to come out this fall, and speculation on new features is flooding the internet. So far, predictions range from dual cameras to wireless charging. The one everyone is wondering about is the possibility of Apple’s removing the headphone jack. Does this mean we just have to throw out all these old ones we carry around? Shaking my head at you, Apple, shaking my head.
An unnamed 14-year-old who who’s going to have trouble finding anyone to sit with in the cafeteria has stepped forward as the plaintiff in a new class-action lawsuit against Snapchat, which claims the app’s Discover section subjected him — and other impressionable teenagers — to sexually explicit content in the form of listicles like “23 Pictures That Are Too Real If You’ve Ever Had Sex With a Penis.” (This list, did in fact prove too real for his young mind, it would appear.) With his attorney Mark Geragos (former clients include Michael Jackson and Winona Ryder), the teenage John Doe is seeking $50,000 in damages for each of Snapchat’s alleged violations of the Community Decency Act. Which translates to $50,000 for every story a teen might actually enjoy reading.
In case you’re not familiar with it, Snapchat Discover is a partnership section of the app where major publishers like BuzzFeed, Cosmopolitan, and The Wall Street Journal share content with users on the Snapchat platform (the Journal’s output is sadly lacking in steamy listicles and eggplant emoji). When users swipe to that section of the app, they are immediately greeted with headlines and images from those publications, content that the lawsuit argues could be inappropriate for younger users. (See here: “I Got High, Blown, and Robbed When I Was a Pizza Delivery Guy.”)
Case documents were shared on Twitter earlier this morning and paint a clearer picture of just how this very serious class-action suit came about. Mostly, you can blame Disney. Each of the “Too Real If You’ve Ever Had Sex With a Penis” pictures featured a beloved character from the franchise, like a still of Aladdin smiling dreamily, captioned with “when he pulls down his pants it’s more beautiful than you could have imagined.” (The list goes on, but we’ll leave the rest to your imagination so as not to corrupt you too.) “Innocent pictures from John’s favorite Disney movies were perverted,” the suit explains, though despite his mounting concern John kept swiping for content.
Update: Snapchat provided the following statement to Select All. “We haven’t been served with a complaint in this lawsuit, but we are sorry if people were offended. Our Discover partners have editorial independence, which is something that we support.”
After reading one particularly enlightening article, “What It Is Really Like to Let People Finger You in Public” (thank you, Vice) our young hero, desperate to keep his heart and mind pure, did what any good teen would do. “John brought what he observed to the attention of his mother. John’s mother was shocked and horrified to learn that such explicit content was actually being made available by Snapchat,” the suit explains. Since then, the two have been “compelled to bring this class action on behalf of the millions of children and parents who have been deprived of the choice to monitor explicit material being made available by Snapchat to minors.”
Of course, this is exactly the point. Snapchat is a perfect youth economy: childishly lewd articles written by young adults served up to Snapchat’s enormously young fan base. Who else other than the under-25 crowd is going to click on something like “23 Pictures That Are Too Real If You’ve Ever Had Sex with a Penis”? The pretense that BuzzFeed’s and Cosmo’s sexy listicles are for adults beggars belief, and eventually Snapchat is going to have to figure out how to walk the line between tame advertiser-friendly content and the more racy stuff that teenagers will actually click on (just like MTV and every other advertiser-supported youth-culture brand before them). “Plaintiff John Doe, and the putative class of minors, are undoubtedly interested in discovering new things on Snapchat,” the suit argues. I’ll bet.
The aptly named RoadPrinter eats up loose bricks and spits out walkways up to 20 feet wide. It’s been used to build roads in the Netherlands and Belgium, and can lay up to 5,300 square feet of bricks in a single work day. Maybe most important, it’s just crazy to watch it do its thing.
A small stretch of the Historic Route 66 Welcome Center will soon be home to the nation’s first solar energy roadway. The panels, created by Solar Roadways, are made of tempered glass and feature LED lights as well as heating elements to prevent ice. So there’s a lot to like here, as long as you can stomach driving down a stretch of highway covered in glass.
Swedish designer Mikael Kjellman wanted to ride his bike even when it was cold outside. So he stuck a canvas body on a four-wheeled electric bicycle, and the PodRide was born. The PodRide is small, but the PodRide is powerful, and much lower on emissions than an actual car. See for yourself what we’re talking about.
Born on the cusp of the USB revolution, I do not know what floppy disks actually do. I have heard stories, but to my mind they are square pieces of plastic that make for tech-savvy coasters. Now, thanks to Paweł Zadrożniak’s YouTube channel, I finally have my answer: Floppy disks are clearly instruments.
Using a combination of disks, channel controllers, and what I’ll assume is a lot of trial and error, Zadrożniak rigged an entire “computer-hardware orchestra” to play the Star Wars “Imperial March.” And it’s excellent.
This isn’t his first computer composition; you can also check out earlier hits, like this Pirates of the Caribbean cover, on his YouTube channel. He’s taking suggestions in the comments of the Star Wars video if you have ideas for his next work. I’m hoping for some “My Heart Will Go On.”
If you want to see what Facebook wants out of its much-hyped new live-video feature, you should follow the money. In its aggressive push for the format, the company is shelling out millions of dollars to publishers like BuzzFeed and the New York Times, and celebrities like Russell Wilson and Kevin Hart, in order to spur a new type of sharing. But so far — exploding watermelons notwithstanding — there’s not much to get excited about. The early days of Facebook Live from big media companies has been a poor approximation of television — a cooking demonstration or a talking-heads panel, awkward people without media training seeking engagement.
What, then, is Facebook to make of last night’s protests across the nation, the shooting in Dallas, or Wednesday’s livestreamed aftermath of the shooting of Philando Castile at the hands of the police? In a gut-wrenching ten minute video, Castile’s girlfriend Diamond Reynolds goes from sitting beside his injured body in the passenger seat, to on her knees outside the car at officer’s orders, to the back of a cop car with her 4-year-old daughter. It is footage that is at once strikingly familiar and distinct.
Images of black people dying at the hands of police have become all too common — Michael Brown, Walter Scott, Alton Sterling, and too many others — but Reynolds’s footage, shot from her perspective not as a bystander but as a central figure, is a new twist on the depressingly pervasive format. Livestreaming became a central tool for protesters in the wake of Michael Brown’s death in Ferguson two years ago, but this is the first time it’s been used by a central figure in the moment of an actual violent encounter with police.
There is no way for Facebook to “lean in” to the culture of livestreaming that surrounds the movement to reform police violence in the same way that it is throwing money at corporate digital publishers without taking a strong political stance. In a post last night, Mark Zuckerberg expressed his condolences to Castile’s family, but remained vague in his phrasing.
As horrifying as it is, this is, on a broader scale, a perfect example of the promise of new technology and the internet — giving a digital megaphone to people and amplifying voices shut out of mainstream media. What then does that mean for Facebook’s live-video initiative, which seems laser-focused on replicating mainstream media’s familiar silhouette instead of embracing entirely new formats? (This is hardly, as of right now, the most important question in need of an answer, but how platforms like Facebook learn and react from videos like Reynolds’s will help shape the future.)
Facebook is enormously powerful — likely the most powerful media company on the planet. But in the end, its customers will always determine how a feature is used. Users will always win. Users came up with the hashtag to focus discussion; users saw an opportunity to use Instagram for e-commerce, not just for picturesque vacation pictures; and users saw a way to use mobile video for situations that don’t fit the broadcast-news mold.
One major problem here is Facebook’s trust in its almighty algorithm to provide users with things relevant to them; the archive of Reynolds’s livestream (now at more than five million views) vanished for an hour in what the company described as a “glitch.” Facebook has always been uncomfortable with designating humans as the deciding force when it comes to what users see, particularly with the stench of the recent Trending Topics controversy still in the air. It has applauded activism using Facebook’s platform but never actively placed it in front of users. Compare that with last night’s highly effective Snapchat story, curated by editors, on police protests around the nation and the shootings in Dallas. It’s a stunning argument for Snapchat’s use as a quasi-real-time news service, and a dense justification for live video.
Facebook has long acted in a sanitary manner — its early selling point was cleaning up the Myspace clutter; its News Feed algorithm theoretically provides readers with exactly what they want to see; it has been slow to hand control over to users. Now it is confronted with a new user behavior, broadcasting uncomfortable images to millions of people, who often want to further their distribution. What’s clear is that live video like the one of Castile is catalyzing user reaction and behavior much more so than other formats — activists are encouraging others to record their interactions with police, and one told the New York Times, “Just because of the sheer number of people and its convenience, Facebook is probably going to become more popular for these types of videos.” But it’s not clear whether Facebook is ready for live video to be wielded for the purposes of real, vivid, graphic reporting instead of entertainment.
In just under a month, the eyes and the brands of the world will watch as athletes compete for gold in the Rio 2016 Olympics. Well, at least the top brands like McDonald’s and Visa (think Morgan Freeman narrating dramatic black-and-white ads) who pay millions of dollars to officially sponsor the Olympics will be watching athletes compete for the gold in Rio. Companies that aren’t official sponsors will be watching as athletes compete for shiny metal awards during an international quadrennial sporting event in Brazil, thanks to a strange rule that bans them from using key Olympic terms in any of their marketing.
Previously, under the International Olympic Committee’s rule, nonofficial sponsors were not allowed to use Olympic athletes in their ads, even if they had preexisting deals with the athletes. On the flip side, athletes weren’t allowed to tweet about any sponsor that wasn’t on the official list. (Because we all very much believe the world’s most elite athletes eat Chicken McNuggets.) In 2015, the IOC changed the rules around a bit, AdWeek reports, but there is a still a lot of red tape for nonofficial brands and their athletes.
From AdWeek:
Under these new rules, ad campaigns for nonofficial sponsors had to be submitted and approved by the IOC back in January and had to begin running in March. This works out fine for a large company like Under Armour, which can afford to keep top athletes like Michael Phelps on the payroll year-round to star prominently in marketing. This “Rule Yourself” spot from Under Armour doesn’t include any of the IOC’s banned terms, but 90 seconds of Phelps lifting weights and swimming laps gets the point across loud and clear. This is an ad about the Olympics, without saying it’s about the Olympics. For smaller companies, it’s not always feasible to contract an athlete months in advance, especially when decisions about who will actually compete in the Games won’t be made for another four months. (Phelps is a no-brainer, but many would-be competitors have no idea if they’ll be competing until the final scores and times are tallied at Olympic trials. Choose the wrong athlete and a brand is stuck with a very sad spokesperson who won’t be much help in Rio.)
Sally Bergesen, CEO of Oiselle, a company that sponsors track and field athletes, explained how the the updated rules still don’t do much to help nonofficial sponsors, or their athletes, in a blog post earlier this year. “Not only are we not allowed to mention (tweet, post, home page, email, etc.) the athletes we might have there, but as a “non-Olympic partner,” Oiselle (and any other business) is forbidden from acknowledging that the Olympics are even taking place,” Bergesen explained, listing all the phrases her company still cannot use, including “Olympics,” “games,” “gold,” “silver,” “bronze,” “summer”, “2016,” and “challenge.”
So instead, Bergesen, and every other company that isn’t on the official sponsor list, will have to cheer their athletes via Twitter with rousing choruses of Move efficiently while wearing our product, you athletically inclined person! and Bring home a hunk of refined metal that currently sells for $1,364.20 an ounce! Which will definitely be something to look out for next month when events kick off in that Brazilian city we’ll denote only by its ongoing Zika problem and construction delays, instead of its name.
YAB is just dollars away from meeting its goal on Kickstarter, and if it does, by December 2016, we could have an app that prevents that panicked parking garage search for good. Whether or not it will help you find a stolen car, however, remains to be seen. The only question we have to ask ourselves is whether Apple’s new iOS is going to push a similar product out before YAB even launches, thanks to a new feature that claims to do this for you.
Asphalt Green’s AG6 workout takes place in a room that looks like an arcade. LED lights are everywhere, and the floors and walls respond to touch. But that’s about where the fun and games end.
This week, a new app is destroying lives around the globe for myriad reasons. That’s right, Pokémon Go is here.
Nintendo made a Pokémon game for mobile phones?
As you can tell from the name, Pokémon Go is a Pokémon game — the series where you capture cute fantastical creatures and force them to perform violence for your amusement — but it’s not like any of the one’s released for Nintendo systems. It’s a smartphone app for Android and iOS.
Well, no. Pokémon is actually the property of the accurately named Pokémon Company, in which Nintendo has a 33 percent stake, the largest of any shareholder. The Pokémon Company partnered with developer Niantic to create Pokémon Go. Nintendo isn’t directly involved, but certainly benefits from the app’s success. Following the game’s release, Nintendo stock jumped 10 percent overnight.
What is Pokémon Go, and how does it work?
Pokémon Go is an augmented-reality iPhone game, meaning it mixes real-world locations with, well, Pokémon. The object of the game, as in most Pokémon games, is to catch wild monsters, and then fight your monsters against other monsters at “gyms.”
Players join the blue, red, or yellow team and take control of real-world locations. It’s like a more complex version of king of the hill.
This is a complicated question. Objectively, the game is very bad. For the first several days, server problems made it almost impossible to play. It’s still extremely buggy and janky, and needs to be restarted frequently. The mechanics are odd and not necessarily “fun.”
Sounds neat. Is the game any good?
But for those blessed enough to play it, how’s it going?
And that’s the thing: People are very into it, which can be a problem for a game that forces you to interact with the real world. Already, a police station in Australia has been forced to caution players against wandering into the station for the game’s sake, and is also warning people to look up from their phone before crossing the street. Other players have flocked to churches, or had their jobs threatened for playing too much. Some locations have been frustrated by the influx of traffic. One player allegedly found a dead body while stumbling around hunting creatures.
What’s the catch?
The game is free to play, so you know there’re microtransactions all over it. You need items like Pokéballs to capture Pokémon, and to get those items, you need gold. There are ways to get gold for free, or you can fork over some cash.
Oh yeah. Pokémon Go has already generated tons of social media content.
This is a meme, right?
Because this is a fandom thing, I have to ask: are people shipping anyone in Pokémon Go?
Yes, players are horned up for Professor Willow, who teaches you how to play the game.
There you have it. That’s Pokémon Go, a broken game that’s creating a lot of memes and making users horny.
But this means that in order to move around in the game, you have to move around in the real world. Some gamers are having trouble processing this.
For years, technology and security experts have warned us about the Big Hack, a cataclysmic infiltration that cripples power grids and utility lines, leaving us helpless as our most trusted devices are turned against us. This week, we moved one step closer to that event.
In New Jersey this week, according to NJ.com, devious hackers took control of an electronic highway sign near the Jersey Shore, changing its message — which displayed essential navigational information — to read, instead, “poop.”
It is unclear who did this or why. Menacing.
The state’s Department of Transportation directed the contractor that owns the sign to remove the message, which it did. Officials do not yet know how many motorists traveling along the westbound lane of U.S. Route 40 were traumatized by the message.
What makes Pokémon Go so cool (“cool”) is that the app tracks your physical location via GPS, and then populates your surrounding environment with Pokémon. You hold up your phone, and a small cartoon monster will appear onscreen, standing on the sidewalk or lawn or monument in front of you (that’s the “augmented reality” part).
There’s more to the game than catching Pokémon, of course. Some real-world locations (statues, fountains, churches, murals, murder houses) are “Pokéstops” where players can obtain items. Other locations are “gyms,” of which players, who eventually join one of three teams, can take control. It’s like a more complex version of king of the hill.
But it’s very difficult to say that a game as immediately and wildly successful as Pokémon Go — a game that’s managed to get thousands of gamers out of their houses and into parks — is bad. In fact, despite its own best efforts to be terrible, the game can be extremely fun!
Here is some excellent life advice, courtesy of Reddit. Should you come across a pack of monkeys roaming the streets, do not feed them. If you do, you run the risk of being rushed by 20 or so creatures scaling your body like a jungle gym and inspiring nightmares for years to come. Also, Reddit will take the opportunity to photoshop you and the monkeys into all sorts of ridiculous situations.
As the latest installment in Reddit’s Photoshop battle series (a redditor submits a photo and then other Photoshop-savvy redditors edit the photo to their hearts’ content until someone is declared the winner), the primate-filled photo has inspired some excellent edits. Like this one, though I’m hard pressed to believe any animal, even a monkey, would actually be lured in by the spell of Axe.
But still, are you not entertained?
Hidden Gibbons seems extremely effective.
Like we said, maybe just skip feeding the animals next time.
Over the weekend, the United States was hit with a Walking Dead–style epidemic: Pokémon Go. Did you see the roving bands of people, lumbering around parks and monuments, smartphones in hands, staring intently at their screens? Or maybe you were infected yourself, taken to muttering There’s a Squirtle over there under your breath, drawn toward odd city memorials? The Pokézombies have taken over the world. May God have mercy on us all.
Pokémon Go is, of course, the suddenly viral augmented-reality game that requires players to move around in the real world to catch Pokémon at IRL locations. (You can read our more in-depth explanation here.) Its wide appeal — ranging from kids who are into Pokémon now (and, of course, their parents) to 20-somethings who were into Pokémon 15 years ago — and its novel basis in real-life interaction turned it into a phenomenon. Friendships were made! Businesses were saved! And, uh, people were robbed!
Louis Park, an American volunteer fighting ISIS in Syria, claimed to have caught a Squirtle on the front lines.
The app has outpaced Tinder and Twitter on Android …
In other words, people went bonkers for this game.
Others are taking advantage of Pokémon fever in more tangible ways. One gay club was using the app as incentive over the weekend.
If that’s not enough, players have also been warned not to play the game while driving. The Washington State Department of Transportation had to tell users, “No Pokémoning from behind the wheel.”
Others were more … enterprising. According to police, thieves in the St. Louis area added a beacon to the game in order to lure players to a parking lot and then rob them.
(Some reported Go-related car accidents were fake, however.)
Pokémon is destroying lives, you guys.
A New Zealand duo actually kayaked out to a fountain in order to claim territory.
Another claimed the homophobic Westboro Baptist Church for the yellow team using a Clefairy named Loveislove.
Some users discovered that the game’s location data can send you to sketchy places, like a famous Massachusetts murder house.
Many almost-certainly-fake stories like this, involving a shady Pokémon meetup between a white man and two black men, are floating around. A lot of people are passing one another on the street giving small glances and knowing looks. If someone is wandering aimlessly on their phone, the odds are pretty good that they’re playing Pokémon Go.
A casual meetup in Sydney, Australia, attracted more than 2,000 people.
… and magically added $9 billion to Nintendo’s market cap, currently at $28 billion.
Later this July, Republicans and Democrats will each hold national conventions to select their party’s official presidential candidate. And now Twitter won’t just be a place to make fun of what candidates are wearing or proffer a well-timed West Wing joke — you’ll also be able to watch the nominating action live on the platform.
Twitter announced on Monday that the company has struck a deal with CBS and will be offering a livestream of both conventions, Recode reports. The stream, featuring live coverage from the network’s digital news streaming service CBSN, will be free and available even if you don’t have a Twitter account. Which could be a good way to entice non-Twitter users over to the platform. However, there is always the chance that they’ll mosey over, watch the conventions, and still not join.
This isn’t Twitter’s first foray into the livestreaming world. The company also has a deal with the NFL to stream games this fall, Recode notes. Though, if Twitter is really looking for some foolproof live content, we suggest it start looking at animals, not humans. Much more fun.
Pokémon Go has taken the world by storm since its release on July 6, but it hasn’t been all fun and games. Like the time a young woman casually stumbled upon a dead body while searching for water Pokémon near a Wyoming river.
It’s only been a week since Pokémon Go was unleashed into the world, but the app has quickly taken on an evolved form beyond what anybody could have possibly expected. The game has surpassed Twitter and Tinder in users, drawn crowds of thousands, sent people exploring the furthest reaches of the Earth, inspired a crime ring, and even turned up a dead body. Now, people are using the game to find love, or, um, something like love, via Craigslist’s “Missed Connections” section.
“I thought you were really cute and wanted to hook up but didn’t want my friend to interfere or think it was weird to try and pick you up over Pokémon Go.” Because wandering the streets, phone in hand, trying to track down invisible monsters isn’t weird. But asking somebody out for coffee might be. Right.
Male owners of polarized Ray-Ban sunglasses in the San Francisco Bay area, take note here. You may remember him as the man close enough to you in the park to tell that your sunglasses had polarized lenses, if that helps jog any memories.
There’s the potential for a Pokémon threesome with this one, if you’re into that sort of thing.
“You asked me about Pokémon Go at the cafe today. I like Pikachu ears. I had to eat and run, but want to say hi,” writes one man in California looking for a fellow Pokémon Go–playing lady. After all, what better way could there be to find a potential soul mate than in the augmented-reality space that is the internet. How very Pokémon Go.
“You told me where the magmar was and I told you which way to find the sandslash….sorry I gave bad direction…I hope you did find it. Also..I thought you were very cute. I’d like to get too know you better if you even see this lol,” writes a man in Arizona. LOL.
And finally, this woman, also in Arizona, is looking for the man who ran off after she helped teach him how to play the game. Sir, if you are out there, do not be intimidated by a powerful, Pokémon-playing woman.
“If you are cool enough to catch a Jinx, you are cool enough for me,” writes another player in North Carolina. And they say romance is dead.
If you or anyone you know posts an ad on Craigslist and actually succeeds in finding the Pikachu to their Ash Ketchum or the Jessie to their James Rocket (oh wait, I think they were siblings, never mind), please let me know. Otherwise, I’ll assume everyone is still just wandering hill and dale looking for sex, love, and a Charizard.
YouTuber Sufficiently Advanced has no problem sporting a helmet with flaming jets just inches from his eyes, but we don’t recommend it. We do, however, recommend watching this video of the X-Men-inspired creation, because it’s filled with action, adventure, and fire. Sounds fun, right?
It’s a new week, which means a new “optical illusion” for the web to sink its teeth into. I wouldn’t call this one an illusion (like this award-winning, shape-shifting illusion), so much as a puzzle, but if you’re looking for a way to avoid work on a nice afternoon here’s a way to do it.
Here’s a rug. More than 18,000 people have shared the picture of said rug on Facebook. Because on top of this rug, somewhere, is a cell phone.
Having trouble? Look closer at the inner blue stripe in the upper right-hand corner.
Pokémon Go: If you’ve been outside in the last three days (or read this website), you know it’s big. You can play it anywhere in the real world!
Players can capture Pokémon pretty much anywhere in the game, but certain locations, designated as Pokéstops, are tied to named real-world locations. According to our tipster — himself not a Pokémon expert — there was a “blue square thing” at Auschwitz, indicating that the area is likely explicitly marked, probably as a Pokéstop. (Pokémon Go has not yet officially launched for users in Europe, so confirming this is difficult.)
A tipster informs us that he was able to capture a Rattata while visiting the concentration camp, a prominent location in the Nazi’s Final Solution to eradicate the Jewish people.
That the location would appear in the game is not directly the fault of the developer, Niantic. The game uses location data gleaned from Google Maps, and Pokéstop locations are often imported from user suggestions made on a previous Niantic game, Ingress. Pokémon themselves are randomly distributed on the map: A developer didn’t say, “Let’s make sure there are some Pokémon at Auschwitz.” On the other hand, it would be simple to restrict certain areas and prevent Pokémon from appearing in or around them.
Including Auschwitz.
Games like Pokémon Go pose, let’s say, unique challenges for developers: When should they step in and tailor the experience, and when should players be allowed to interact with the map as it exists in real life? You can, for instance, visit locations in and around the Freedom Tower in Manhattan, otherwise known as Ground Zero. The Daily Tar Heel reports that a controversial statue of a confederate general is a Pokéstop. In Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, the writer Muna Mire points out, many of the Pokéstops are murals painted as memorials.
That you can still play the game at Auschwitz is especially surprising, however, given that Niantic ran into this exact problem last year, with Ingress. Players could battle for control of real locations, including those inside Auschwitz, Dachau and Sachsenhausen. In this case, it seems as though Auschwitz isn’t a “gym” — and therefore you can’t “control” it — but it’s still a marked location where you can, incongruously, catch cartoon monsters.
At the time, the company said in a statement that, “After we were made aware that a number of historical markers on the grounds of former concentration camps in Germany had been added, we determined that they did not meet the spirit of our guidelines and began the process of removing them in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.”
Independent booksellers BooksActually operate two book vending machines in Singapore, and there are apparently similar operations in places including Japan, Sweden, and Germany. The trend may actually encourage people to put down their smartphones and pick up a novel. That is, if they don’t already have it on their Kindle.
By now, you, or someone you know, has joined to zombie horde of Pokémon Go players wandering the countryside looking to catch pocket monsters in augmented reality. As part of the game, players seek out Pokéstops, or locations where they can pick up much-needed items like Pokéballs, medicine, or snacks. And while some Pokéstops have been discovered in cool places (strip clubs are cool, right?), many are in decidedly less than glamorous locales. Enter: /r/ShittyPokestops, a subreddit dedicated to highlighting the world’s most bleak Pokéstops. The board is very new, but already excellent. Here are the five that have already risen to the top of the Pokémon trash heap.
1. An ashtray
2. This door handle
5. This graffiti
4. An old drinking trough
3. The entrance to a Target
Today, July 12, is Prime Day, our nation’s greatest holiday created by, and for, an enormous online retailer. All day long, stuff will be going on sale. Some stuff will be discounted all day; some will be discounted for mere minutes. If you are a neurotic deal fiend, this is like torture. How are you supposed to know what to do and when? Read on for our succinct guide to deal-finding success on Amazon’s Prime Day.
1. Chill.This is extremely important. Don’t let the one-day/flash-sale hype intimidate you as you browse the site. Many of the deals you’ll see today won’t really be worth it for your needs or bank account. Prime Day is not really an occasion for impulse buys — but if you’ve been on the fence about something and it’s got a good discount, maybe pick it up! Rather than reload Amazon’s page endlessly, check in on some of the stuff you’ve been thinking about buying throughout the day There’s no magic equation for figuring out if something’s the right price. Use your best judgment. I believe in you.
2. Use Amazon apps and devices.If you’re really intent on spotting every deal (have you considered a less nutso hobby, like Pokémon Go?), then look for deals only available on Amazon mobile apps or via devices like the Kindle Fire and Amazon Echo. Yes, that’s right — there will be deals you can only claim using voice commands.

3. Try these deals.Other than those two things, there’s not a whole lot to tell you. If you need a new monitor or something and the price is right, grab it. Amazon’s got a pretty solid return policy. If you don’t get a deal in time, guess what — that’s fine, too. It’s not the end of the world. That being said, here are some electronics deals we spotted that we think are worth it.

Doom ($29.99 for PS4, usually $59.99): By all accounts, the new Doom is great, and at half-price, it’s a decent impulse buy, if you want to be in on the Zeitgeist.
Bose SoundTrue Around-Ear Headphones ($99.95, usually $179): I have the on-ear version of these and they sound great and are extremely comfy, so I would bet these are more of the same, at a pretty good price.
Amazon Echo ($129.99, usually $179.99): The Echo, which rarely goes on sale, is $50 off today — a more than 25 percent discount. If you’ve been looking for an excuse to try out Amazon’s extremely well reviewed flagship “thereable,” this is perfect.
Arris SURFboard Cable Modem/Wi-Fi Router ($99.99, usually $149.99): Owning your own cable modem means that you don’t have to pay ridiculous rental fees to your ISP, and this is a great modem for two-thirds of its normal price. But there are still a few caveats: First, crunch the numbers and figure out if it’s worth it in the long run — are you going to be paying the rental fee for long enough that purchasing is worth it? Second, make sure your internet provider supports this model. And finally, note this is both a modem and a Wi-Fi router — if you already have a Wi-Fi router you like, you’re better off buying the cheaper modem-only version of this product.
This is extremely important. Don’t let the one-day/flash-sale hype intimidate you as you browse the site. Many of the deals you’ll see today won’t really be worth it for your needs or bank account.

Use your best judgement. I believe in you.
First, you’ll need to sign up for Prime, which you can do here with a 30-day free trial.
eero Home WiFi System 3-Pack ($399.99, usually $499): Tech reviewers have raved about eero, a new it-just-works Wi-Fi system that promises to eliminate dead zones — with the catch, always, that it’s really expensive for what it does. Until today! Well, true, it’s still expensive. But at 20 percent off, that’s about as inexpensive as a miracle cure to your Wi-Fi ailments will get.
This week, Uber is starting a new promotion for New York City riders. For $79, users will be able to take unlimited uberPOOL rides (rides shared with strangers) during peak commute hours anywhere south of 125th Street, Slate reports.
The rides are only available from 7 to 10 a.m. and 5 to 8 p.m on weekdays, so you’ll have to pay for another Uber or take the subway if you want to get anywhere on a Saturday or Sunday. Using the uberPOOL card to commute back and forth to work brings the cost per ride to just under $2. By comparison, an unlimited monthly MetroCard costs about $116. Which makes Uber a pretty decent deal if you are the kind of person who doesn’t need much transportation beyond getting to work each day. (Find out more about purchasing a card here.)
Of course, it’s not a perfect fix. At least, not yet. While taking an Uber to work might save you some money over the course of the next month, there are also those days where driving to work, even in a shared ride situation, takes longer than the subway. (This is coming from someone whose commute options are driving down the parking lot known as Second Avenue or taking the dreaded 6 train.) For those days, you’re probably still going to need a traditional MetroCard handy. Or you could try the Uber for hot-air balloons.
The commuter cards are currently just a one-month promotion and not a long-term product for Uber. Rather, they’re an experiment that lets the company dip its toes even deeper into the waters of private mass transit. Uber’s CEO Travis Kalanick has made no secret that he believes the answer to traffic problems, like gridlock, is ride-sharing. And while it’s easy to laugh at the idea of a man who owns a ride-sharing company promoting ride sharing as the future, he might not be so far off, as traditional subways and roads get more and more crowded each year.
Pokémon Go has been out in the world for almost a week, so it’s time for the backlash to begin. If you are sick of reading your friends’ tweets about Jigglypuffs, can’t stand another headline about Pokéstops, and the thought of thousands of people wandering the streets together looking for imaginary monsters makes you physically ill, we have a solution for you.
A new Google Chrome extension called PokeGone will eliminate all references to the aforementioned game while you browse online. Like many a Chrome extension before it (the one that removes Donald Trump references, the one that turns millennials into snake people), just download and go in peace knowing your internet is now Pokémon-free.
The extension hasn’t even been around a full day yet, so early reviews are inconclusive. “This guy couldn’t catch ‘em all,” writes one reviewer who gave the extension three stars. “Hate that this even exists,” writes a reviewer who left only a single star. (Though we’re guessing that review had more to do with a love of pocket monsters and less with flaws in the extension.)
In less than a week, Pokémon Go has nearly surpassed Twitter in daily active users, netted Nintendo investors billions of dollars, and led a Wyoming teen to becoming an unwitting aid in a police investigation. So, in light of its ubiquity and rapid topical ascent, let this two-minute guide serve as a Pokémon Go starting point for the uninitiated who want to see what the fuss is about and give it a try.
This week, at the Stanford Shopping Center in California, a 300-pound robotic security guard accidentally smacked into a 16-month-old boy and rolled over him. Oops.
If you follow along with Uber-related news, you might be familiar with the egg-shaped, robotic security guard. Earlier this month, news broke that the company uses two of them to patrol its car-inspection lot in San Fransisco. At $7 an hour, the rental robots are certainly cheaper than paying a human security guard, though human guards also haven’t been known to wheel themselves over unsuspecting human children. Which is definitely something to consider, at least until robots get smart enough to differentiate between toddlers who are casing the joint and toddlers who are, well, not.
The robot, which stands five feet tall and was built by a company called Knightscope, is engineered to patrol areas and alert human authorities to any suspicious activity. (It’s enabled with several cameras to film potential problems.) Unfortunately for the boy, it seems he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and the robot kept on patrolling anyway. “The robot hit my son’s head and he fell down, facing down on the floor, and the robot did not stop and it kept moving forward,” the boy’s mother told ABC 7 News. (The boy fortunately did not break any bones, but we’d have to imagine getting his tiny, child foot steamrolled by a clunky robot didn’t tickle.)
Researchers at MIT have come up with an innovative way to revolutionize urban planning. It’s called CityScope. It’s a series of interactive tools that can be used to solve problems in cities all around the world — from bus routes in Boston to the refugee crisis in Europe. Their unlikely favorite tool? Lego blocks.
If you’re anything like me, this weekend you sold all of your worldly possessions, said good-bye to your family, and headed west in search of Pokémon. From the hills of Appalachia to the waves of Malibu, phone-wielding Americans have succumbed to an epidemic of Pokémon Go, the augmented-reality smartphone game that lets you catch Pokémon’s fictional little monsters in real-life locations.
“Janky” is really the only way to describe it. For the first few days, the game was rarely accessible, as its servers kept going down; over the weekend, users were forced to log in over and over again; even now, it freezes and locks up constantly. The gameplay itself can be fun — look, Pokémon in real life! — but in most ways it’s just another smartphone game: You wait, you swipe, you grind out levels. Put another way, there’s very little from the actual experience of using the app that would indicate that it was destined to become an enormous success. Even to the developer, Niantic, which has struggled to keep up with demand. And, indeed, before Go, Niantic made a near-identical game, Ingress, which was popular but never quite broke into the mainstream.
There are still many unanswered questions, such as “How do you play Pokémon Go?” “Should I break up with my boyfriend if he leaves dinner to catch a Squirtle?” and “Where can I find a legendary?” Far beyond, and much less important than those questions, is how the hell a janky, barely working children’s video game has suddenly become the most talked-about app since Snapchat.
Among other things, it helps demonstrate the important distinction between VR and AR, which is often just considered a half-step toward the full experience of virtual reality. With VR, you put on a headset that essentially blocks out the world. There are merits to this type of full immersion and simulation, but you have to carry those experiences back with you into the real world. VR, while in use, is pure escapism. AR, on the other hand, combines with the tangible, piggybacking onto the real world and giving you new ways to interact with it directly.
That nostalgia creates a built-in audience eager for an IRL Pokémon experience. And it’s here that Pokémon Go is most interesting. Go represents the most widely adopted example yet of augmented reality, a much-hyped technology that uses phones and other viewers to add a layer of computer-generated imagery and information on top of the world around you. While AR (and its cousin VR) are in early stages, it can be hard to get a sense of what they’d look like and how they’d be used when adopted widely. By launching with an already-enormous audience, Pokémon Go gives us a glimpse of what mass adoption of augmented reality looks like in practice.
And well, the other thing is: Pokémon Go makes the augmented-reality future actually look … really fun. For all the complaints about zombies lumbering around public parks, Go is a surprisingly social experience. It’s hard to play it, out in the world, without running into fellow players — striking up conversations, exchanging tips and directions, and generally laughing about how goofy it is to meet and interact with new people thanks to a Pokémon game.
This is a striking departure from the virtual-reality dystopias envisioned by skeptics — people sitting slack-jawed on their couches, jacked into a fantasy world better than the real one. It’s true that virtual reality has enormous potential to create social experiences. But it’s hard to imagine, barring several enormous technological leaps, a virtual-reality social interaction that beats in-person conversation. (Ultima Online designer Raph Koster puts it in gaming jargon: “Pokémon GO has the best emote system available: the human body.”) For VR to work, it needs to be flawless, but for AR to really work, it just needs to be good enough. And that’s what Go is. It’s certainly not a great game, or even addictive one.
When you catch a pocket monster in Pokémon Go, you have a few options. You can leave the name of your Pokémon as its species or give it a moniker of your own choosing (name your Bulbasaur after your mother — that sort of thing). Or you could let your phone’s autocorrect do the thinking for you, which is what one Redditor decided to do with the 11 Pokémon he or she has caught thus far in the game.
But as a way to look at the world, or to meet and interact with people, it’s great. The Pokémon Go utopia is active and social, and uses technology as a way to enhance — or, at the very least, alter — one’s interaction with the physical world, rather than close oneself off from it. Weirdly enough, people staring at their phones at public parks might end up being the best argument we have against Luddites who claim that technology is cutting people off from each other.
So what gives? One thing Pokémon Go has going for it is — to put it scientifically — a metric buttload of nostalgia. Despite the app’s infrastructural problems, Niantic has done a great job of creating the “experience” of spotting and catching Pokémon as envisioned by millions of adolescents watching the cartoon or playing the earlier games. And, well, those cartoons and games are the product of a 20-year-old marketing juggernaut that turned Pokémon into an international empire in which anyone under the age of 30 has spent time. Maybe most important, it has a large group of former fans who game more often on their phones than on Game Boys. (If you don’t believe me, Vox’s Alvin Chang has the data to back this up.)
The post was only shared an hour ago, but thanks to Pokémon Go mania, it is already at the top of the front page. The Redditor did not give much detail beyond “I let autocorrect give nicknames to my Pokemon,” so it’s unclear exactly how these names were settled upon. Best guess is the user let autocorrect edit the given species names of the Pokémon, hence Ghastly becomes “gast lyfe.” Or, as another Redditor put it, “I didn’t choose the gast lyfe, the gast lyfe chose me.”
Earlier this summer, SpaceX engineer turned Hyperloop One co-founder and chief technology officer Brogan BamBrogan left the company with seemingly very little warning. Now, BamBrogan (along with several other Hyperloop One employees) is suing his former company and colleagues in a move Hyperloop One is calling “unfortunate and delusional.”
Documents first published by CNBC show that BamBrogan (whose name used to be Kevin Brogan, before he married a woman named Bambi and legally changed his name, yes, really, and, honestly, we haven’t even gotten started here) has filed a formal lawsuit, naming fellow co-founder Shervin Pishevar, Palantir’s Joe Lonsdale, and Hyperloop CEO Robert Lloyd as defendants. The suit claims BamBrogan’s former colleagues have mismanaged funds and responsibilities “to augment their personal brands, enhance their romantic lives, and line their pockets (and those of family members).” Specific complaints include Pishevar dating the company’s PR rep and significantly raising her salary and Lonsdale hiring his brother’s firm as the company’s investment bank. (Alleged nepotism! Fun!) Hyperloop One, for its part, says “the claims are pure nonsense and will be met with a swift and potent legal response,” according to a statement provided to Select All from Orin Snyder, a partner at law firm Gibson Dunn.
The suit also details a charming anecdote about a particuarly tense business dinner with Hyperloop One investors in Russia which BamBrogan did not attend, citing “critical issues facing the company.” Following the dinner, Afshin Pishevar (former Hyperloop One chief legal officer and brother of Shervin Pishevar) allegedly placed a noose on BamBrogan’s chair back at the Hyperloop One offices. (The incident was caught on security cameras.) Which might just explain the restraining order which BuzzFeed News reports BamBrogran filed against him before heading out the door.
Prior to leaving the company and filing the suit, BamBrogan and the other plaintiffs (which include the company’s former assistant general counsel and former finance vice-president) had reportedly sent, earlier in May, a letter to the company voicing their concerns. The letter was dismissed by Shervin, Lonsdale, and Lloyd, who are now probably wishing they’d given it a second thought before everyone in town got their hands on a picture of BamBrogan brandishing a noose at the office. Hope that PR rep is good at her job!
A representative for Hyperloop One called the lawsuit against the company “frivolous” and provided the following statement to Select All.
Hong Kong-based artist and designer Tobias Gremmler turns dance into data using a complex digital scan, and then translates it into these ethereal animated abstractions. This one, which riffs on traditional Chinese opera, is mesmerizing to watch. Even if you knew absolutely nothing about Chinese opera before watching this video, you’ll be oddly entranced by the movement.
The Echo, Amazon’s voice-enabled speaker-assistant, is maybe the most talked-about (and talked-to) new gadget since the iPhone. It’s futuristic, it’s weird-looking, it’s extremely useful, and you should buy one.
If you thought Pokémon Go had turned your friends into augmented-reality addicts, brace yourself. Imagine what would happen if your friends could decide to join the House of Lannister or the House of Stark and wander the streets seeking dragons, reviving Jon Snow, and lighting people on virtual fire. (Okay, I don’t watch Game of Thrones, but I think this is what the series boils down to.)
Yes. I mean — maybe you live off the grid or something; I don’t know. But if you’ve got electricity and internet access and disposable income to the tune of 130 bucks, the Echo is a genuinely great gadget that will be useful in basically any home.
Really?
Sure. It would be easy to keep living without an Echo. And, look, it won’t solve any particular problems for you. But it’s not supposed to. All it really does is make your life just a little bit easier, in ways that you don’t really start to appreciate until you’ve had it in your house for a while.
My life is basically fine without an Echo.
What do you mean?
Take checking the weather. This is a task that has been made increasingly easier over the last two decades, to the point of being, more or less, the easiest thing you can do on an iPhone: You just have to swipe down, and your weather widget will show you the temperature.
But taking out your phone, and swiping, and reading is still more complicated than asking Alexa: “Alexa, what’s the weather like today?” It sounds ridiculous if you haven’t used it, I know. I’m embarrassed to even type it! But after a few days of using Alexa to check your weather — from bed! In front of the closet! On your way out the door! — using your phone starts to feel like an enormous burden.
This just sounds like a lazy man’s enabler.
When you consider the number of things Alexa allows you to do while doing something else — setting a timer while putting food in the oven; ordering more toothpaste while finishing the last tube; putting on a playlist while setting up for a party — you could potentially make the argument that the Echo actually saves you time and makes you more efficient. But, honestly, my answer is: Why not enable your laziness?
Still: All the things it does are so minor. Why spend money on it?
The slightness of its chores, in my experience, is the whole point. Think of every basic daily fact you’ve Googled and every task you’ve launched from your iPhone’s bottom drawer. All that stuff can be done, with less effort, and with more use, by Alexa. That’s not just a collection of small features — it’s a whole category of service. Plus, figure you’re already going to spend about half that on a Bluetooth speaker of equivalent quality, so really, you’re spending the difference on the services.
Well, does it work?
Yes! Vastly better than the current form of Siri. This is the real selling point: It works extremely well. Space-station-AI well. Robot-butler well. Future-of-tech well. And definitely worth-your-money well.
In an interview with GameSpot, Archit Bhargava, a developer at Niantic (the company responsible for Pokémon Go), said the company is excited about the room for potential growth in the world of AR and that his ideal game would be placed in Westeros, the fictional land created by George R. R. Martin himself.
“Or whatever.” Exciting hypothetical stuff! Now just take a breath, remember it takes months and even years to create an actually good, augmented-reality game, and resume catching Pokémon while you wait.
Examples included esoteric yet prominent-on-the-web formats like pancake art, “100 Years of X” retrospectives, segments in which people “answer user submitted questions on behalf of [their] entire race as a joke,” and narrowcasted identity content (“14 Signs You’re From The Midwest,” or whatever).
Last week, vlogger Akilah Hughes leveled a very serious accusation against BuzzFeed: large-scale plagiarism. After making her argument at length on Twitter, she called, in a petition, for advertisers to sever ties with the website, which she said was stealing video and formats from independent web-video producers and presenting them as original ideas.
Well, he’s right: It’s pretty clear that the BuzzFeed posts predated Hughes’s (and others she cited). But more than proving Hughes wrong, the Medium essay serves to demonstrate that BuzzFeed is itself a recycling factory, churning out content about the same set of topics, ad nauseam.
This is fine; it’s not as though BuzzFeed is hiding this fact or pretending to be something different. That there is nothing truly new on the internet has been a principle assumption of web content for a while, but it’s rare for someone to lay it out so explicitly and defensively — especially when he’s a multimillionaire in charge of one of the most influential media companies on the planet.
And it ends up calling attention to questions of attribution and creative control that are maybe a little less comfortable for Peretti. BuzzFeed’s Buzz (editorial content not produced by their news division) is often just a conglomeration of other people’s funny pictures and tweets and social-media posts. And on a purely creative level, that’s more or less fine — this exchange is how the internet is supposed to work. It’s one big chicken-and-egg conundrum that almost always fails to provide a definitive, correct answer to the question of “Who did this?”
Where the back-and-forth becomes thornier is where the money enters into the equation. Hughes’s original post calling out BuzzFeed was addressed not to them, but to advertisers who provide BuzzFeed with revenue. She writes:
Though the accusation managed to gain some traction among Hughes’s followers, as a controversy it didn’t rise to a level much beyond Twitter sniping. Which is why it was more than a little surprising to see BuzzFeed founder and CEO Jonah Peretti firing back today, on Medium, in a strident and lengthy post (complete with custom art!). Weirder still was that his argument ultimately boiled down to: If BuzzFeed is guilty of copying anyone, it’s BuzzFeed itself.
There’s the rub. The ultimate offense is not that BuzzFeed is arguably using other people’s creations, it’s that they are actively profiting off of them. Open exchange of ideas is a core principle of the internet. Open exchange of money, however? Not so much.
Addressing a series of conspicuously similar YouTube thumbnails showing introverts wearing blankets over their head, Peretti pointed out:
If you’ve grown tired of Mayfair, Juno, and that one Instagram filter that makes everyone’s face look like a Florida orange, here’s a new photo-editing app to try. Prisma offers over two dozen different filters inspired by some of the world’s most famous artists and paintings. Want to turn your selfie in a homage to Edvard Munch’s The Scream?There’s a filter for that. Prefer something more geometric, try the Mondrian option.
As far as apps go, Prisma is fairly simple to use. Download the app (it’s currently only available for iOS users) and allow camera and photo access. When you pick the photo you want to edit, keep in mind the app crops all images into a perfect square (think back to the olden days of Instagram). Then you just pick a filter and decide how heavily you want to apply it, by dragging your finger across the screen from left to right.
From there, you can upload the photo directly to Facebook or Instagram (though you do have to deal with the Prisma logo that is automatically added to the bottom right-hand corner of each image) and wait for your friends to compliment you on how angular your cheekbones look.
The new app has picked up some steam this week, despite the giant app shadow being cast by Pokémon Go. Prisma is available in 25 countries and reports hundreds of thousands of daily downloads, MacRumors notes. (The Prisma developer team is “scrambling to double their server capacity to process all the information.”)
Do you know how to build an app? Do you have a desire to publicly embarrass yourself? Are you free to fly to Los Angeles “over a non-consecutive period from late 2016 to early 2017”? Great. You should apply to be on Apple’s inaugural reality-tv show.
Titled Planet of the Apps, the long-rumored Apple show is finally coming to fruition. Applicants need to be at least 18 and can submit as many app applications (again, groan) as they’d like, so long as the app is in beta by October 21. Perks of joining the cast include “the chance to receive hands-on guidance from some of the most influential experts in the tech community, featured placement on the App Store, and funding from top-tier VCs,” the show’s website explains. (Though still no word on who those experts will be.)
To apply, Apple is requesting people submit a one-minute video introducing themselves and showing off their personalities, before August 26. The company also asks that all submissions be shot horizontally, not vertically. But if you’re applying to be on a TV show starring techies, we’re going to assume you already knew that.
Following last week’s shooting in Dallas, in which five police officers were killed, police in Detroit arrested four people for making threats against law enforcement on social media. As of Monday, according to the Detroit News, they had not been charged with a crime.
As the Intercept notes, charges related to online threats are a contentious issue, seen as possibly limiting or having a chilling effect on free speech. Those making threats — even vague ones — have been charged with crimes including disorderly conduct, cyberharassment, and public intimidation. One of the men arrested in Detroit called shooter Micah Johnson “Definitely a Black Hero,” which is a repugnant stance but not really an actionable threat of violence.
Last year, in a case concerning rap lyrics, the Supreme Court ruled that intent is a major factor in online threats. There is a distinction, the majority ruled, over whether someone “transmits a communication for the purpose of issuing a threat, or with knowledge that the communication will be viewed as a threat” or whether they are simply being reckless.
There are a few ironies in police arresting people for reckless, heat-of-the-moment social-media behavior in the midst of a national dialogue about … reckless police behavior. Alongside that is how law enforcement has, by and large, been dismissive of online threats and harassment, particularly against women. There are countless tales of law enforcement responding with a shrug when it comes to online harassment. But now that police are the target, it seems like they’re finally paying attention.
It’s called HK, and its development team apparently consists of “two humans and two cats.” They’re still in rather early in the preproduction stages, but the team has posted some impressive sneak peeks on their blog.You’ll be able to play it on PC (and maybe the PS4 and XBox One) when it’s out. But you might have to take some long cat naps in the meantime, because it’ll probably take a few years. That being said, take a look at this incredible footage, and trust us, you’ll want to play it right now.
The New York Times needs to do a much better job engaging and interacting with its readers. Or at least that’s the argument of the paper’s new public editor, Liz Spayd. In her debut column, printed Sunday, she argued that the Gray Lady is falling short in this regard:
As Matthew Ingram noted in Fortune, Spayd’s debut effort was not met with sterling reviews. At Slate, Isaac Chotiner called it a “travesty.” “A disastrous first outing,” tweeted Jason Pontin of the MIT Technology Review. “Show me an editor who cares about comments, and that’s someone with the wrong priorities.” (One place Spayd’s ideas went over well: Gamergate’s main hub, the /r/kotakuinaction subreddit.)
There is certainly a fair amount of cluelessness on display here. A quick Google search shows that, like every other major outlet, the Times conducts reader surveys that provide richer information than the “bulk”-level statistics; these help the paper’s management understand, for example, that an audience’s “preferences, habits and shifting ways of consuming information.” For Spayd to act as though it’s a publish-worthy insight to suggest the Times should ask readers why they go to other sites is a bit like a newly minted NBA columnist informing his readers that people should realize LeBron James is a really good basketball player. (There’s also the fact that, like most publications, the Times can glean a certain amount of knowledge just from the data it collects on reader behavior: how long they stay on pages, how far they scroll, where they come to the site from.)
But what’s really at the root of the problems with Spayd’s column is something that animates a lot of misunderstandings: a vague and imprecise definition of “reader.” Throughout the column, Spayd mixes very different sets of readers without establishing the appropriate boundaries: Sometimes she’s talking about paid subscribers, sometimes she’s talking about reaching a “broader” audience — that is, potential readers.
It isn’t hard to quickly come up with a list of very, very different sorts of readers. There are the subscribers and daily buyers — the dedicated readers who will stick with an outlet even when it doesn’t live up to their standards. There are those readers’ bizarro cousins, the obsessive haters, who view the outlet in question as an irredeemable, “bias” mess, but who seem to read — well, skim, quickly — every article just so they can comment on how terrible it and the outlet it appeared in are. (Can you guess which of these two groups is better-represented in online comment sections? Hint: Not the one actually worth listening to.) There are the casual visitors, who come when linked, and enjoy the outlet, but have no particular attachment to it over any of a dozen peers; and, of course, there are the drive-by idiots, who stream in by the thousands from Facebook or Drudge, drop something stupidly inflammatory at the bottom of an article on a hot-button subject, and hit the back button, never to return. The less moderation you have, the more drive-by idiots you have — that’s why Twitter is a dumpster fire.
But a paid subscriber is going to look different from a potential reader, will have different preferences, and will be able to tell you different things. There might be some cases where an outlet like the Times finds out what a potential reader wants — erotic photographs of good-looking people without clothes on, for example — and make an institutional and editorial decision not to meet those readers.
You can broaden that point, in fact: Overall, for a given outlet to remain healthy, it’s vital for that outlet to swiftly, with great prejudice, ignore a lot of people who could be described as “readers.” A lot of it is noise, noise, noise. The never-ending threats to unsubscribe that commenters and Twitter users love to brandish are largely empty and often come from people who weren’t subscribers in the first place. A onetime reader who disagrees with a single post he stumbled upon from another site is likely to disagree with many of the other things an even basically editorially coherent outlet is publishing.
Obsessive haters, dedicated fans, and drive-by idiots can all be lumped together as “readers,” in the sense that they contribute page views to particular piece of content. But they’re coming from very, very different places. The haters and drive-by-ers have no investment in the outlet in question, and are basically there to stir shit up. The dedicated readers are invested in the outlet — so invested, in fact, that they’re already locked in as readers and, in many cases, paid subscribers. There are exceptions, of course — if thousands of your dedicated readers simultaneously get pissed off, that’s useful information — but overall there’s a strong case not to pay too close attention to the feedback presented by any three groups on a day-to-day basis.
Nowhere is this clearer than in the discussion over comments sections, which Spayd views as “the most elemental way The Times can let its audience engage.” Every outlet with comments has its own system, of course — at the Times, when you can comment on an article you don’t need to be a subscriber, but the comment is moderated before it goes live — but the point is that unless you restrict commenting to subscribers and/or moderate your comments quite heavily, which imposes significant costs, you will be hearing from a broad swath of the internet, many of whom, given the nature of social media, are likely drive-by haters or their close cousins.
If you’re going to argue that it’s important to hear from these people, you should explain why they offer more useful information than what can be gleaned from the sorts of audience surveys and focus groups Spayd ignores. That’s why Chotiner’s charge that Spayd is engaged in “phony populism” sticks. It certainly sounds good to say “Open up the comments! Let the readers’ voices be heard!” But who are the readers? And are you sure their opinions matter?
Nope, just dragging yourself to the gym every day, or using your hard-earned money to hire a real personal trainer is not enough. It’s time for the robots to rise and take over our fitness. That’s exactly what these headphones do. You run with them, they tell you how hard you’re working, learn about you over time, and press you to work harder. What a world.
If you are still unsure how you feel about the Pokémon Go craze sweeping the globe, I am here to tell you: You should be afraid. Very, very afraid. Exhibit A: this mob of Florida college students converging on campus trying to hunt down a singular Squirtle.
Maybe it’s the image of dozens of students, staring at their phones, hunting in a giant pack, or their primal screams of, “Oh my God, SQUIRTLE,” but something about this whole clip is downright terrifying. After all, only one person can actually catch the Squirtle.
Fortunately, the crowd disperses after one lucky, screaming player manages to nab the monster, but I have no doubt the masses will rise up again as soon as word of a Blastoise or Goldeen makes it way around campus.
With Pokémon Go sweeping the nations, destroying families, and leaving a path of ruin and destruction in its wide wake, it’s no surprise that even the most mainstream of mainstream TV networks reported on it. Earlier this week, CBS ran a report on the phenomenon featuring a clip that, let’s say, alarmed some viewers.
Now, having borne witness, you too are cursed to see these faces whenever you close your eyes, for the rest of your sullen, pitiful life.
I love this clip. Everything about this rules. The way the dead-eyed Pikachu stares at you with his beady little eyes. The look of ecstasy as Bulbasaur attempts to climb/hump a tree. The way Charmander’s foot clips through the rock as he spins on a singular axis. It’s phenomenal, and it haunts my days and night without end.
Charmander and Bulbasaur, made by a user named Kudz46, each cost $20 to buy. Pikachu, made by user chopnut, costs $5.95.
Kudz46 is a ghost, but I managed to track down chopnut — real name: Ernani Danting — to ask him about the clip. The model, uploaded in 2010, mostly sat dormant. “I was learning how to model at the time, and made a Pikachu, put up on sale on TurboSquid for [a] measly $6,” Danting recalled. “And I got a sold message from TurboSquid after a long, long while. I didn’t really put a lot of thought into how people will be using it.”
Total cost: $45.95.
CBS’s folly, however, is our collective gain. I for one hope that they keep using these amateur Pokémon models for all reports, or really, for any news reports that need a little spicing up.
He mostly took issue with the fact that the models were presented without being animated. “It does look like they didn’t put a lot of effort doing anything with it,” he said. Pikachu’s arms-out stance is because the model is rigged, meaning it was meant to be programmed with animation. “Seeing it used like that kinda made me bit disappointed. I rather like seeing it animated.”
But how did these pocket monsters, no longer a delightful misnomer, come to be? Using advanced web forensics, I managed to find all three models on the website TurboSquid, which allows users to upload and sell their 3-D models. Searching for each of the Pokémon names brings up search results, and each of the models used by CBS.
At this point in the election cycle, I’d be troubled if I thought you weren’t familiar with the Republican nominee for president. But let’s say you needed to explain candidate Donald Trump to someone who’s been in a coma for the last 20 years — someone who isn’t aware of Trump’s brand of boisterous, adolescent non-politics, but is deeply familiar with the characters of 1990s newspaper comics. You wouldn’t need to spend much time going into detail about Trump’s various offensive statements or his inability to stay on message or his pathological need for attention. You could just say: Donald Trump is Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes. And you could show them this Imgur gallery.
The modified cartoons come from an entire subreddit, /r/DonaldandHobbes, devoted to shopping the many faces of Donald Trump onto Calvin’s tiny, T-shirt-wearing body. “The strip you paste Trump’s head over has to contain dialogue that Trump might actually say. You can edit dialogue so Calvin’s name is missing or certain words (perhaps too intelligent for Donald) are gone. But just putting Trump’s head on Calvin acting like a kid is missing the point,” explains the subreddit’s rules, which seem entirely too fair and kind to Mr Trump.
Money, women, conspiring against your political enemies, Calvin (as Trump) has a hot take on all of it. And somehow, it’s a little bit more palatable coming from the body of a small, animated child. (Until you remind yourself that small child could potentially run the United States government.)
Should a Trump presidency actually come to fruition, we can only hope he’ll appoint a stuffed tiger as his chief of staff. Which, at this point, doesn’t seem beyond the realm of possibility. Besides, Calvin never really heeded Hobbes’s advice anyway. Which seems like a very Trump thing to do.
150. Magikarp This flopping fish out of water is literally the most hopeless of all Pokémon, but its limitless potential for trolling saves it from being the absolute worst. Take over a hard-won gym and station a Magikarp there just to prompt a disbelieving double take. —KB
146. Ekans Honestly, this Pokémon is trash, but it’s funny at least once to point and say, “There’s a snake in the grass.” —KB
149. Diglett Diglett only exists so straight guys can take pictures of it on their jeans and pretend it’s a dick. Like, we get it. You’ve needed something to do since they cancelled Entourage and you’re taking it out on Diglett. —KB
148. Arbok Arbok’s whole vibe is unclear. Was one face not enough? Arbok is basically the Pokémon version of those line drawings that can either be a beautiful woman or a witch, and that’s just too much trouble as far as we’re concerned. Imagine dating one! You can’t. —KB
147. Koffing This literal embodiment of air pollution is potentially a sign that your neighborhood might be killing you. Move. —Jackson McHenry
145. Weezing Did you know that in the beta version of Pokémon Red and Blue, Weezing was named “LA”? And it’s a giant clump of smog? We can’t stand for this Los Angeles shade. —JM
144. Paras People get so excited when they catch their first Paras and you’re just over here going, “Wait until you have 73 of those, okay? You will start cussing out this cute little crab.” —KB
143. Raticate You just made a Rattata larger? And gave it huge fangs? We saw enough giant rats during the Verizon strike, we’re good. — JM
142. Dugtrio See Diglett, multiply all the potential for childish jokes by three. — JM
140. Muk People always make fun of the fact that Pokémon eventually introduced a creature that is literally garbage, but we should never forget that it started out with one that is literally Muk. — JM
138. Gastly Listen, it’s great that there’s a nighttime Pokémon, but when you see Gastly’s silhouette, it literally looks like a monster emerging from a cloud of murderous poison. No one needs to deal with that when they’re out hunting at one a.m. This is not The Mist, Gastly. Calm down. —KB
136. Spearow Pidgey with anger issues, which is at least an intriguing wrinkle. — JM
133. Victreebel What is this paunchy, villainous gourd madness? Victreebel may be strong, but aesthetically, this is a hard pass. (Still, he’s not as bad as in the anime.) —JM
132. Exeggutor In which Exeggcute’s eggs acquire the trunk of a palm tree and turn into … coconuts? Eggs do not grow on trees. (Points for the punky, palm-frond hairdo, though.) —JM
127. Drowzee Even though Pokémon Go isn’t technically available in Canada yet, some enterprising trainers have figured out a work-around, and what they’ve discovered is that the country is full of Drowzees. That just feels right. —KB
124. Hitmonlee What happens if you only do leg day. Loses points for combining its torso and head. Necks are a good and necessary thing. —JM
122. Electabuzz Electabuzz is a respectable, powerful electric-type Pokémon. Still, we can’t shake the impression that it would overuse the word “gnarly.” —JM
123. Lickitung A being of pure, Lovecraftian horror that is mostly one giant tongue, but we do appreciate that it’s a big fan of sushi. —JM
120. MetapodPros: Potentially indestructible. Cons: Everything else. —JM
95. DodrioAlmost as fun to say as “Duduo,” though haunted by the Cronenbergian horror that is this third head. Where did it come from? Can it think independently of the other two? What if it’s just an empty vessel, staring at you in abject terror? Points for that, we guess. —JM
96. Doduo Empirically speaking, this Pokémon has one of the most fun names to say, which is important. But the more you think about this twin-headed bird, the more unsettling it becomes. If you pet one head, does the other get jealous? If one head swallows a worm, does it eventually wriggle out of the other one’s mouth? We don’t have answers, just questions. —KB
98. PidgeottoPidgeotto is great because it flies, which is useful, and because it sounds like something the Three Tenors probably sang once. It’s very cultured of you to possess at least one Pidgeotto. —KB
84. Tangela Currently only legal in Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and Colorado, but still real fun to hang around with. —JM
82. Poliwrath Powerful, but held back by its clammy hands, or hand-glove things, or whatever these are. —JM
86. Voltorb A Pokéball that has come to life and bleeds electricity. One of the most annoying things you can encounter in the Game Boy games. Held back by its cry of pure evil. —JM
76. SlowpokeEverybody needs a water Pokémon so Slowpoke is a very exciting catch. The only downside is that it’s psychic, too, so if you’re judging its beach body, it will know. —KB
74. Shellder A shy clam. Moving along. —JM
73. Oddish A plant with legs. (We’re fine with this.) —JM
72. FearowA bigger Sparow, which is pretty meh, but it is the closest thing the original 151 Pokémon have to a vulture (Mandibuzz doesn’t come until much later), so we’ll give it points for the brand. —JM
71. Kabuto Reminds us of a trilobite, which reminds us that trilobite is just a great word. —JM
70. Kabutops Potentially the villain in any number of slasher movies. Also, pretty good at cutting things around the house if you have one on hand. —JM
69. Persian She’s beauty and she’s grace. She’s also the favorite choice of mobster kingpin. —JM
67. StaryuStarfish never looked so much like the clue to some sort of dark, international illuminati conspiracy. —JM
66. MachokeYou can tell this guy would throw off your sleep schedule by doing thousands of pull-ups every morning. —JM
65. TentacoolProbably friends with Ellen DeGeneres. Took over a resort community that one time. Literally cool. —JM
64. Tentacruel The evolution from Tentacool to Tentacruel is among the more charming bits of wordplay in the Pokémon universe. Also, a full grown Tentacruel is about the size of a small building. We would like several of these calamari to go, please. —JM
63. Dewgong Dewgong’s one of only a few ice-type Pokémon availible in Pokémon Go, which gives it a distinct advantage (ice is a super-effective way to take down dragons; don’t ask why). Also, you just know that Dewgong would make for a great cuddle, with that soft, snow-white fur. —JM
61. Charmeleon Charmander, but more moody. Charizard, but not as cool. —JM
62. MachampThose extra arms are a clear lesson about the dangers of living off protein powder. —JM
59. Meowth Generates money in most Pokémon games, but not in Pokémon Go itself. Why do you gotta be so stingy, Meowth? —JM
60. TaurosPokémon hero Ash Ketchum caught 30 Tauros in one episode of the Pokémon TV show. Why, you ask? Well, have you seen this furious, three-tailed rage bull? The real question is why he didn’t catch 60. —JM
56. Wartortle A Squirtle with wings for ears, which really flies in the face of Coco Chanel’s whole “take one piece off before you leave the house” philosophy. Still, it’s the criminally underrated middle child of Blastoise and Squirtle. Who can blame it for trying to stand out? —JM
26. CloysterWhy is this fortified clam ranked so high? Well, a) it’s an ice-type (the best type), b) it’s got some great angry facial expressions going on, c) refer back to the words “fortified clam.” —JM
17. StarmieA literal gem, which also has the ability to control water and manipulate psychic forces. Flawless. —JM
8. VaporeonLove an Elizabethan collar on a virtual monster! —KB
2. Squirtle Quite simply, a boss. The chillest Pokémon, part of a squad before it was cool, and an undeniably solid choice for a starter. —JM
2. Your phone is still useful even when it’s locked. With iOS 10, swiping left on a locked iPhone leads to a redesigned dashboard that you can customize with useful widgets showing information like the weather and calendar events. If you’re concerned about your phone falling into the wrong hands, you can modify your dashboard so it doesn’t show anything too personal, but, for somebody whose phone is always in hand, it’s a convenient way to do a quick check for notifications.
The Los Angeles County Fire Department would like to formally remind you that 911 should only be dialed in the event of genuine, honest-to-Pikachu emergencies. And in case you are still confused as to what constitutes an emergency, here’s a tip: If it involves Pokémon Go, it’s probably not an emergency.
While most New Yorkers have been busy running up and down Lexington Avenue trying to catch anything other than a Rattata or a Zubat, one brave artist has decided to focus on what lies beneath the combat power. In the style of Brandon Stanton’s Humans of New York series, David Wardell has been capturing New York’s Pokémon not with Poké balls, but with his camera. “I created Pokémon of New York in an attempt to raise awareness that life in this city can be rough for Pokémon trying to make it on their own,” Wardell told the Daily Dot. “They’ve got dreams, they have families, and above all, they have heart!”

The Notes app giveth, and the Notes app taketh away. Last night’s rumble between app mogul Kim Kardashian and Apple critic Taylor Swift — the latest in a long-running feud over an lyric from a song by Kardashian’s musician husband, Kanye West — began with a set of videos uploaded to Snapchat by Kardashian, showing that Swift had, in fact, approved a lyric she later disparaged. But it reached its apex a few hours later, when Swift responded with — what else? — a screenshot of a statement written in Notes, one of Apple’s iPhone apps, and uploaded to Instagram.
The “search” link isn’t the only interesting thing about Taylor’s note. If you blow up the full-resolution version of the image posted to Instagram, you can see some faint text in the corner just above the Search button. If you scroll downward in a note, the text will move upward, behind the near-but-not-entirely opaque banner menu at the top of the app. As text moves behind the banner, it can still just barely be seen.
What does it mean?? An educated guess: “because it [the footage] doesn’t exist” is one of the many drafted lines of counterattack that Swift was discussing with her squad of celebrity friends and PR handlers, before settling on the statement she posted to Instagram. At the very least, Swift played herself by revealing that even in the midst of a celebrity feud, her supposedly off-the-cuff social-media response was constructed artifice.
Now, obviously, all that button really indicates is that she has so many notes on her phone that she had to search in order to find it again.
Notes statements are ubiquitous on celebrity social media, as the podcast Who? Weekly has noted often. They’re one of the true joys of the post-tabloid age — a perfect example of the democratization of social media, in which even the rich and glamorous are forced to use the same cobbled-together kludges as the rest of us when they need to publish a lot of text to a site like Instagram, which favors the visual, or Twitter, which has a character limit. Screenshots of Notes are quick to write, assemble, and distribute — which means their textured-paper aesthetic is often the sign of quickly composed PR triage.
But where Notes can be a godsend to celebrities in urgent need of damage control, it can also betray them.
In other words, that text appears on the same note, and has been nearly hidden because Taylor has scrolled down. It reads “because it doesn’t exist.”
Note, for example, how in Swift’s screenshot, the “search” link appears in the upper-left corner. In Notes, that link only appears if you’ve clicked through from a list of search results. (If she’d clicked from the default list of notes, the link would say “Notes.”) So why was Taylor Swift searching for a statement she’d supposedly written just last night? Is it possible that Swift was posting one she’d composed earlier in the year, at one of the many other moments when her feud with Kardashian reignited?
Washington, D.C., thinks it might have found a solution that will help take some pressure off of its emergency services: Uber. NBC reports the city’s Fire and EMS Department (DCFEMS) is considering moving to car-sharing services or taxis for people who call with less-urgent problems.
People whose issues don’t rise to the level of an emergency would be picked up by an Uber or another cab service and taken to a doctor’s office, rather than being brought to an emergency room via ambulance. Last year, the EMS department responded to over 160,000 911 calls, the majority of which were later deemed low-priority emergencies, NBC also reports. The Uber of ambulances idea is still in the early stages, but the city says it is looking to make changes by fall 2017. “We are trying to find creative ways to try to reduce the strain on the system,” DCFEMS Chief Gregory Dean explained.
Of course, a good way to start would be to remind your friends that playing Pokémon Go does not constitute a real emergency.
Last week, news broke the Donald Trump had selected Indiana governor Mike Pence as his running mate. As often happens, people took to Twitter to check out what Pence had to say. Understandably, many of them went to @mikepence, who is not the governor but is instead a 49-year-old software engineer who lives in Florida. (His avatar is an American flag, which might have confused some people.) Given Twitter’s penchant for insightful and measured political discussion, we checked in with Pence to see what it was-like to be caught in the social media crossfire.
It is also interesting that for all of our obsession with our mobile devices, television appearances blow up my notifications like nothing else does.
What has this week been like on Twitter?
Are you getting noticeably more replies than you used to?
I can’t begin to catch up with the mentions of @mikepence on Twitter. On the one hand, it has been hugely entertaining, since I get to troll conservatives a bit by pretending to be in a love affair with @realDonaldTrump using my account. On the other hand, any hope I had of actually using Twitter to have conversations with the many amazing software engineers that I know is pretty much on hold until the governor is (hopefully) no longer the talk of the moment.
Way more, but the vast majority of people are not paying any attention to what I have actually said on my Twitter account, or they would know that I am a liberal, atheist, ex–Jehovah’s Witness computer programmer, and not a bigoted shill for the Republican party who is all-too-happy to throw Muslims under the bus for a chance at power.
A bit of both. I have long gotten hate-tweets from the left directed at the governor that make me cringe. Getting a front-row seat to a constant barrage of vitriol from the left and groupthink and fan-boy-swooning from the right hasn’t left me with much hope for a political future where civilized discourse holds much sway.
What are people saying to you? Are they more supportive or critical?
Do you try to let people know that they have the wrong guy or do you just ignore it?
I have made attempts, but don’t generally waste the time to correct people. I have been on Twitter since 2007 and have been participating in social media as a consumer and as a developer for a very long time. It is not really a central part of my day any more.
Has anyone tried to buy your username from you?
Do you own other Mike Pence usernames, like facebook.com/mikepence? Have you had any trouble there?
Nope. I suspect that the Governor’s camp knows that I am not a fan of him or his ideology and that any attempt to buy the username would be a waste of their time. Why would I be an enabler of a campaign driven by such small-minded hate?
Do you have a plan for the rest of the year? Are you setting up filters or considering locking down your account?
I have had one fan of the governor try to friend me on Facebook. Otherwise, there has been no crossover.
I am planning to keep the account because of the trove of valued contacts from my professional life that I am connected to there. Worst case, I get less value from the account because of all of the noise. I have a feeling that if the Trump ticket actually gets elected, that may well be the least of my worries, because I have worked in finance and I know how they react to uncertainty and instability.
Today, I met up with a new running group for the first time, and got to say “My name is Mike Pence … unfortunately.” I am expecting a lot more of that.
Would you vote for Trump/Pence?
Never. I grew up a Jehovah’s Witness and was freed from that cultlike group by opening my mind to new information that I found on the internet. I similarly was a fan of Rush Limbaugh and embraced conservative values because they seemed harmonious with the values I was raised with. But now I deeply regret how I behaved toward gay people and how I shunned those who grew to believe differently than me. That is not love, and that is not the kind of person I want to be, nor is it the kind of thinking I want to see in elected officials.
Imagine you and your dog are going for a nice stroll in the woods, when suddenly, you hear buzzing footfalls headed your way and a human-sized, bipedal robot crosses your path, trailed by a team of handlers and their gear. Actually, you don’t have to imagine it, you can just watch this video of the scene. (But you will have to imagine the sound of me screaming at the screen while watching it.)
We live in the age of the virtual pillory. Across communities like YouGotPosted, the revenge-porn hub/blackmailing scheme, or 8chan’s doxxing and raid board, whose server Fredrick Brennan conveniently formatted after its admin was caught selling Social Security numbers, or Gamergate, the “cringe-worthy breakup story” that became a self-sustaining witch hunt against women in tech, a highly recognizable positive feedback loop of abuse and harassment plays out: A target gets dragged into the public eye, more people begin to abuse them, and that abuse escalates as individual trolls try to one-up each other. In the eyes of the mob, the target’s life is a game, and the object is to screw it up as much as possible.
Kiwi Farms (whose name wasn’t coined until 2014) grew out of the groups who harassed Chris-chan in 2007 — but it’s obsessed with Chris-chan in way the original groups no longer are, and as a result its parent communities hold KF in (mostly mutual) disdain. KF’s first wiki, “the CWCki,” was created because users felt Chandler’s page on Encyclopedia Dramatica wasn’t detailed or accurate enough. Since 2008, every drawing, video blog, tweet, Facebook post, eBay listing, Etsy item, and PSN purchase Chandler makes has been archived on the CWCki and exhaustively discussed on the forums. During this time, various accounts of hers have been hacked, and the leaked data hosted on the CWCki. A whole coterie of KF members have also pretended to be Chandler’s friends and romantic partners in order to con Chandler into giving them more embarrassing content (photos, videos, drawings, etc.), which are then used to torment her. In the most extreme instance of this, they goaded a 13-year-old boy into masquerading as a 19-year-old girl in order to have phone sex with Chandler (and record it, of course).
The largest virtual pillory, and the one that best exemplifies its ethos, is Kiwi Farms, a loose community — centered on a forum and two wikis, with some activity on Tumblr, Twitter, Steam, and “lolcow” chan boards — that specializes in harassing people they perceive as being mentally ill or sexually deviant in some way.
Chandler is far from the only “lolcow” to be targeted by KF. If anything, Kiwi Farms has been a victim of its own terrifying “success,” and attracted way more would-be trolls than its Ur-victim could possibly respond to. (Strewn about the KF forums and the CWCki are paradoxical admonitions to not contact Chandler, and to not organize trolling plans on the forums, in part because if too many idiots start calling the Chandler residence to yell memes at her elderly mom, she may go on hiatus again, depriving KFers of their entertainment.) For this reason, the community encourages would-be trolls to stalk other people with the same vigor, in the hopes that some of them might prove to be as “entertaining.” The selection of new marks goes through a specified process on Kiwi Farms. Judging by the people they stalk the most, Kiwi Farms preferentially selects those they perceive as mentally defective or sexually deviant in some way for their virtual pillory.
It doesn’t just stay online, either. KFers show up in real life to document Chris-chan’s court appearances, to photograph the Chandlers’ residence from the street, or to surreptitiously photograph Chandler herself in public places. Over the course of eight years, they’ve contacted Chandler, her pastor, and her parents, posing as journalists, former classmates, psychiatrists, potential business partners, and others, in the hopes these ruses yield more confidential info. Twice, female KFers arranged real-life dates with Chandler, both of whom used fake names and wore wires to record these outings. Packages and letters are routinely sent to Chandler’s residence, many of which contain obscene materials designed to unsettle the recipients. In one instance, someone sent prostitutes to visit Chandler’s house, then called the family to taunt them about it.
Sonichu provided an unwittingly revealing look into Chandler’s life and fantasy world. Users on /v/ responded by mocking the art and its creator immediately. To them, Chandler was asking for harassment by putting the comics online. Within days of “discovering” Chris-chan, a profile about her was posted on Encyclopedia Dramatica, the wiki of record for 4chan and similar communities. After pleading with ED’s admins to remove the page, Chandler started vandalizing it, establishing an abuse/reaction cycle in which the reward for provoking her was more fodder for the mob.
The origins of Kiwi Farms lie, as you might expect, on 4chan. In late 2007, Sonichu, a homemade comic-book series mixing the Sonic and Pokémon franchises, came to the attention of the anarchic, anonymous message board’s video-games community, /v/. Sonichu was the work of a self-described “artist, gamer and creative type” named Christine Weston Chandler — later dubbed, using the honorific attached to anyone unfortunate enough to come to the attention of 4chan, “Chris-chan.”
The truth is, I think it might be A-Logs all the way down. It isn’t a stretch to imagine that KF members are acting out of the same insecurity that motivated A-Log; that by ridiculing those they perceive as mentally ill or sexually deviant, KFers feel functional and successful by comparison. By putting these people up on their forums, they reject the notion that they themselves might share anything in common with their targets. And that works, so long as everyone remains anonymous and pretends not to care too much either way. A-Logs put the lie to the rationalizations that make Kiwi Farms a comfortably consumable entertainment product.
The doth-protest-too-much tone of obsessive stalkers scornfully describing their victims as crazy isn’t lost on Kiwi Farmers. There’s a term for those who embarrass the larger community by revealing their own eccentricities: “A-Logs.” It’s named after a former member, Anthony “A-Log” Logatto, who drew attention to himself by furiously comparing Chris-chan to Hitler. Logatto’s malicious diatribes about Chandler got him banned and rebranded as a fit mark for trolling, with those most annoyed with him leading the vanguard. After finding and investigating Logatto’s furry-porn collection and My Life As a Teenage Robot fanfiction, KF’s consensus was that A-Log hated Chris-chan because she reminded Logatto of himself — or, to put it in their terms, A-Log was “the second Chris-chan.” Consequently, KF harassed their A-Log using the same methods they perfected on Chandler, including a spinoff “Logattopedia.”
The Kiwi Farms community is obsessed with its own warped ideas about mental illness. Its justification for picking on Chandler, such as it is, has always been her perceived mental illness — first, for being autistic, and, in later years, for being transgender. That her disability is severe enough to qualify her for SSI benefits is, to her detractors, just another reason to hate her. Everyone KF targets is “crazy” to them, and everything KFers find funny or worthy of disdain is justified as evidence of this perceived mental illness. “Crazy” is both a catchall justification for anything they feel like paying attention to, and the reason KFers will indulge themselves with lengthy armchair diagnoses about their targets. Their deep and abiding scorn for people with mental illnesses leads them to classify anyone they target as mentally ill, and to focus their energy on those who appear most vulnerable. Those people tend to be minorities, women, LGBT people, or kinksters. Victims who exhibit mental strain as a result of being hounded by KFers are subject to a redoubling of efforts, in the hopes they can precipitate a breakdown. To date, one target has killed herself after being featured on Kiwi Farms, after which KF’s admin posted a note exonerating the users and forum from any responsibility for her suicide.
Consider that across the forums there are multiple warnings to members to conceal their identity. For KFers, anonymity isn’t a choice but a necessity — they know what they’re doing is probably illegal, and that their anonymity insulates them from any consequences. They know their “entertainment” harms vulnerable people, which is why some of them felt bad when that one target hanged herself. But, most important, they know that if their anonymity were compromised, their own community might eat them alive.
The video was posted to YouTube over the weekend and also quickly made the rounds on Reddit, where the poster explained that the robot belongs to Boston Dynamics. Or at least, for now it belongs to Boston Dynamics. We all know it’s only a matter of time before the robots take over.
Before we get to anything else, I’d like to formally apologize to Taylor Swift for the dozens of snake emoji I have left in comments on her Instagram account today.
Since the feature’s introduction earlier this year, we’ve spent a lot of time wondering what Facebook’s live video is really for — since it seems clear that, despite the company’s high hopes, it’s not a Snapchat-killing improvisational social feature that will drive up user engagement. But as the trash fire of 2016 burns on, more definitive answers have become apparent. Facebook Live is for documenting breaking news, such as when House Democrats held a sit-in, broadcasting while the C-SPAN feed was cut. It’s for documenting instances of police violence, like when Lavish Reynolds filmed the death of Philando Castile. And it’s for documenting coups, as happened last week in Turkey.
It’s not just that the failed coup provided yet another compelling reason for live video — it’s that it was the first time I can recall that Facebook’s global map of live feeds was legitimately useful, rather than a time-killing gimmick. Flipping between feeds in Ankara and Istanbul (and elsewhere in the country), you could see protests, panic, and in many cases, somewhat mundane footage of people commiserating as sirens pulsed in the background.
The problem is that this isn’t what Facebook wanted. Live was explicitly created to encourage users to share more personal, original content, but it’s found its greatest successes when users are sharing difficult, critical, nationally or globally important video. Not only is this not advertiser friendly, but Facebook, as we learned during the Trending Topics mini-scandal, is institutionally averse to engaging the kind of important and difficult editorial decisions that characterize a news organization. Facebook wants to be known as the site you post birthday photos to, not the site on which you document a military coup, or your boyfriend’s death at the hands of cops. And yet, between its ubiquity, its infrastructure, and its engineering know-how, Facebook has created a brilliant tool for journalism. The only question is whether it will accept that.
The map, and Facebook Live, were gripping, and genuinely useful to people who wanted to follow the developments in Turkey as closely as possible. But this is Silicon Valley, and “useful” isn’t quite enough. You have to make money, too, and an attempted military coup is not something that Facebook brands can replicate or monetize (though maybe someone should get Lockheed Martin on the phone). It joins the House sit-in and the death of Castile in this respect. These are things that people want to see, and should be seen, as they happen. They are news events for which live video is essential.
What set the streams coming from Turkey apart from other live-video moments is that it wasn’t just a single person’s feed like Reynolds’s, or sit-in documenter Representative Beto O’Rourke’s. During the coup, Live worked in aggregate: Clicking between different feeds provided a larger, holistic sense of what the country was experiencing over the course of the night.
I set out to discover the truth. I tried commenting using snake emoji in increasing increments and found that Instagram let me post anywhere between one and 26 snake emoji before notifying me that I had to review my content.
You see: I was doing it for journalism. Snakes began cropping up on Swift’s Instagram account last week after news broke that Swift had secretly written “This Is What You Came For” for her ex-beau, Calvin Harris, whose fans started using the emoji in an attempt to both spam and shade Swift on Instagram. (When fans turn on pop stars and other celebrities, they often make their displeasure known by leaving lengthy strings of telling emoji in the comments of the Instagram, such as when Beyoncé stans flooded the Instagram of alleged Jay Z mistress Rachel Roy with bee emoji.)
When I reached out to Instagram, the company declined to answer any of my specific questions about whether or not the app is monitoring Swift’s Instagram page and deleting comments containing snake emoji. Instead, an Instagram representative offered the following statement: “We’re always looking for better ways to help people prevent spammy or inappropriate comments on Instagram.”
Was a man or machine monitoring Swift’s account? Comments with other emoji still live on Swift’s Instagram: Strings of hearts, for example. Is it possible that the snakes were deleted, or that Instagram was possibly hiding them from gossipy eyes? Or was it just that not nearly as many people were emoji-bombing Swift with snake emoji as were wishing her well?
The apparent and surprising lack of snakes poses an interesting question. Is Instagram automatically monitoring comments? Is Taylor’s team manually deleting every pictograph that might besmirch the House of Swift? One widely circulated tweet (since deleted) showed an Instagram warning for a user trying to leave a large block of snake emoji — was this real, and what did it mean?
So today, I expected to see Swift’s Instagram response similarly covered in small cartoon serpents. But, as several people on Twitter also pointed out, the snakes are nowhere to be found.
Yesterday, as a prelude to the Snapchat showdown with Kim Kardashian West that would quickly consume Twitter, Kim herself made use of the emoji:
The question is: Did the comments stay up? Unfortunately, Instagram comments, once written and posted, are extremely difficult to track. Some seemed to last for at least a few minutes, but they quickly get buried by dozens of other comments. Weirdly, attempts to track the comments by tagging friends didn’t work: The friends received no notifications, and, when I asked them to look through the comments, they couldn’t find them.
Last night, Melania Trump, wife of presidential hopeful and baseball-cap lover Donald Trump, gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. This morning, people have questions. Did Trump make good on her promise to write the speech herself? Did Trump knowingly lift chunks of her speech from one Michelle Obama gave back in 2008? And, most important, did the lady Trump waltz into the RNC and land a large-scale internet joke by Rickrolling us all?
If, somehow, you’ve used the internet and managed to escape the simultaneous torture and pleasure that is a good Rickroll, allow us to explain and kill the joke: You link a friend to something they actually want to read — but the link takes them to the YouTube page for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” music video. Or you splice some clip from it into another video, or you call your friend and whisper the lyrics into the phone, and so on and so forth. Or, if you’re Melania Trump, you just wedge a few choice Astley lyrics into your big speech: “He will never, ever give you up. And, most importantly, he will never, ever let you down.”
Of course, Trump probably didn’t know she was quoting one of the most famed artists of the 21st century. (Just like she didn’t know she was quoting Michelle Obama.) Either way, that didn’t stop the internet train from chugging along and turning Trump’s speech into a true Rickroll video. Enjoy spending the rest of the day with 1987’s most annoying tune stuck in your brain.
Back in March, Snapchat bought Bitmoji, an app that lets users create cartoon avatars, for $100 million. Today, we finally know why and boy, oh boy, is your mom going to be excited. Snapchat users can now insert their Bitmoji avatars into messages and snaps.
Since 2014, Bitmoji has let users create tiny, animated versions of themselves to be inserted into other platforms: sent as text messages, Gchatted, and tweeted. A big part of the appeal is that Bitmoji are hyper-customizable. Being able to digitize yourself right down to the love handles and receding hairline makes them, surprisingly, even more fun to use.
To use Bitmoji in Snapchat, you first have to download the Bitmoji keyboard from the app store and create your avatar. (If you haven’t already.) Then, head to Snapchat’s settings to link the two accounts. From there, you’ll see your Bitmoji as sticker options both in the chat and snap sections of the app. If you are snapping or chatting with a friend who also has Bitmoji enabled (and honestly, if you have a friend who isn’t getting in on this sweet deal, you may want to just let that relationship go), you’ll also see a set of “Friendmoji” stickers, which will combine both of your avatars and means you’ll never have to use your words to express another human emotion so long as you both shall live.
Back in February, a video of a kid repeatedly pelting his mother with eggs made its way around the web. It was fine — funny even, watching his mother scream “Noooo!” (and manage to deftly catch the flying eggs). But this is the internet. Copycats weren’t far behind. Like this kid repeatedly shooting his less-than-thrilled dad with a Nerf gun to the tune of nearly two million views.
This week, a similar video entitled “I Shot My Wife Everyday for a Week With Nerf Guns” popped up on Facebook featuring a man named Jason Ward shooting his wife with Nerf pellets while she shouts things like “No,” “Are you freaking kidding me,” and “If you keep hitting me with that thing, I’m going to shove it up your ass.” A freebooted version of Ward’s video with over 50,000 views is at the top of /r/ videos today on Reddit.
The egg video, despite the obvious duress of its star, was novel. And that first Nerf gun video had the added benefit of the father chuckling while calling his son a “little bastard” for demolishing him. It felt like the dad was in on the joke. But this video, as also pointed out by several redditors, “the title [of the video] should read ‘I filmed the evidence used against me in divorce court,’” doesn’t leave you laughing.
Maybe it’s the clip where he shoots the Nerf gun at his wife as she gets dressed and pulls a shirt over her head or the one where he turns the toy gun on a cat instead, but when Reddit, a place infamous for trolls, starts calling out your content, you might have missed the mark. Sure, it’s possible (and even likely, given that Ward has a Facebook page full of posts where his wife is the butt of the joke) that his wife was a willing participant in the Nerf gag, but the video still comes up uncomfortably short on good, viral content and instead feels heavy on sexism and gags that make light of gun violence in a contentious time. Of course, I supposed that depends how you are measuring. Ward’s original Facebook video has been viewed over eight million times, and counting.
Thanks to the internet and the advent of streaming video, politically minded people all over the world have the ability to watch this year’s conventions on dozens of sites. Practically every major news organization is hosting a stream, and those who aren’t are covering it live on their websites or on social media. But perhaps the most exciting — or, at least, unexpected — site to stream the conventions is Twitch, a site usually (almost) exclusively devoted to video-game streaming.
In announcing the move, Twitch said:
There is a cadence to a high-capacity Twitch chat room. There is an entire lexicon of Twitch terms and custom emoji that can seem impenetrable until you see it in action, in the cascade of words and images flying. People aren’t really talking to and about each other so much as yelling into the void. It’s a lot like a sports stadium, where individual people yell at athletes who can’t really hear them, but collectively form some sort of signal.
I highly recommend watching the conventions on Twitch, exactly because of those lines about “your native habitat” and “the social and communication tools you know and love.” Twitch is, to put it mildly, a lively community, with unique customs and tropes, and a collective voice that make its chat section unlike any other — gleeful, cruel, hilarious, and impenetrable.
There is something distinctly amusing about referring to blustery gasbag Rudy Giuliani as “salty,” a fighting game term for upset or frustrated. As the convention adjourned last night, viewers started filling the chat with “GG,” the standard gamer parlance for “good game.” And, of course, the conversation can also veer into the adolescent and cringeworthy, as when chat participants started spamming “DEPORT” during Melania Trump’s speech.
Streaming the RNC and DNC is the next logical step beyond successful experiments that have seen Twitch viewers rally behind otherwise mundane streams of Bob Ross painting tutorials and Julia Child’s The French Chef. The Twitch convention experiment serves a couple purposes. For one, it gets their community to pay attention to politics, even if marginally. But really, in streaming the conventions, Twitch isn’t forcing politics onto gamers — it’s forcing gamers into politics. Outside viewers will now have a taste of what the enormous and influential Twitch community is like — vibrant, expressive, sometimes problematic, and self-contained — by overlaying Twitch on conventional media. It’s tough to understand what a community is reacting to when you also don’t understand the game that they’re watching. By streaming the conventions, Twitch is hoping to take its parlance mainstream.
The standard Twitch interface is simple: a real-time chat room for viewers, placed alongside whatever is is being streamed — usually a gaming session. The chat is fast and loose, often moving too fast for any one line to stay onscreen for more than two or three seconds, so the messages are short and rarely thoughtful. This high-velocity pace, the site’s focus on video games, and its relative age and quality as a streaming platform attract a web-savvy crowd that engages in what is known colloquially as “shitposting.” Shitposting is exactly what it sounds like: nigh-incomprehensible garbage published with reckless abandon. As a form of rhetoric, it is hugely appropriate for this particular convention.
The tweet was quickly deleted, no doubt after someone at the DOJ realized it had been sent from the official account and not from the personal Twitter of whoever clicked “tweet.”
Or, as Donald Trump might say …
On Tuesday, Twitter announced in a blog post that it’s offering a new way for users to get verified — i.e., get a small, blue check mark attached to their account that confirms they are who they say they are. Now, people who seek the holy mark will be able to send their personal information directly to Twitter for consideration.
If you “believe your account is of public interest and should be verified,” you can enter your personal information on this form and should be prepared to explain to Twitter exactly why they should make your account official. “If the account represents a person, we want to understand their impact in their field. If it represents a corporation or company, let us know their mission,” the blog post explains. If green lit, you may also need to submit a scan of a government-issued ID to prove your identity.
As in the past, Twitter still remains fairly quiet on exactly why they verify whom they verify. “We approve account types maintained by users in music, acting, fashion, government, politics, religion, journalism, media, sports, business, and other key interest areas,” Tuesday’s post half-explained. Typically, verified accounts belong to people who run the risk of being impersonated online, like celebrities, public officials, or journalists, the idea being that verification will keep people from misattributing things to people who never said or shared them. (Like this man who impersonated a publisher and convinced USA Today that Cormac McCarthy had died.)
From there, the company was able to pull some interesting statistics on just what exactly people at the RNC were up to on the internet. A few fast facts: 5 percent of people used the Wi-Fi to play Pokémon Go, while .24 percent used the connection to view porn sites. Which really makes you think twice about what information is being collected about you every time you use the Wi-Fi you thought was provided by your local Starbucks.
This is one reason the new verification system comes at an interesting time. If Twitter were to expand the verification program, and allow anyone who submits proof of identity to use the platform, Dorsey & Co. might finally get closer to actually creating a zone that’s harassment-free without being sterile and boring. Haters are gonna hate, and harassers will harass, after all, but they tend to hate a lot less when their legal and Google-able name is attached to what they say. And by simply expanding an already in-use program, users who want to be anonymous will still be able to use the service — just without automatic direct access to everyone else.
And just like that, the Reign of Milo Yiannopoulos on Twitter — a constant dumpster-fire drama of abuse and racism and shiny, blue check marks being both granted and taken away — appears to have come to an end. Yiannopoulos, the many-intern-having Breitbart tech editor-cum-provocateur, a.k.a. @Nero, has been banned permanently from Twitter.
Dorsey followed through — last night, shortly before Yiannopoulos was set to host a “Gays for Trump” event at the Republican National Convention, he was informed Twitter had banned him permanently. “People should be able to express diverse opinions and beliefs on Twitter,” a Twitter spokesperson told BuzzFeed’s Charlie Warzel in a statement. “But no one deserves to be subjected to targeted abuse online, and our rules prohibit inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others.”
In other words, Twitter has long had ample reason to permanently ban Milo. So why was this the incident that crossed the line? Since Twitter offers up so little info about why it bans or suspends users, any attempt to interpret one of its decisions involves a bit of tea-leaf reading. In this case, though, the answer is likely the faked screenshots that made it look like Jones was saying highly offensive stuff, including using the word “kike.” Yiannopoulos knew exactly what he was doing in blasting out those screenshots — just as he knew what he was doing other times he directed his rabid followers toward specific targets — and the only conceivable goal was to rile people up about Jones and amplify the hate. So whatever you think about Yiannopoulos calling Jones a man or a caricature or whatever else, it just isn’t hard to imagine Twitter viewing the faked screenshots as a step too far, especially given the author’s past misbehavior and subsequent warnings, and especially given the “inciting” wording of Twitter’s statement to Warzel.
Twitter has had an eye on Yiannopoulos for a long time. During a period in which the conversation about online harassment and hate speech has ratcheted up, Yiannopoulos has, relative to the size of his following, become one of the most controversial figures on the platform. In January of this year, he lost his “verified” badge for reasons Twitter never revealed, and last month, around the time he was trying to exploit the Orlando shootings at Pulse for self-aggrandizement purposes, he was briefly banned and then reinstated. He regularly posts racist, misogynistic, and abusive content, and, truth be told, has been doing so for years — he has long used his large and ever-growing base of followers and devotees as a cudgel against his perceived enemies and others he hoped to ridicule, many of them with a fraction of the fame and following that Jones has. More recently, as he has grown cozier and cozier with alt-right racists and anti-Semites, he’s exhibited less of an internal censor: He even put George Soros’s name in Jew parentheses.
The response on Twitter was immediate, and seemed to overtake the Republican National Convention as the social network’s chief discussion topic. And if you’re familiar with the battle lines over online harassment and free speech (or with Yiannopoulos himself), it wasn’t surprising: Over the last 12 hours, conservatives have been caterwauling that this is an unfair infringement on free speech and a clear sign of Twitter’s liberal bias, launching the hashtag #FreeMilo; progressives have mostly cheered the move (#NeroBannedParty), viewing the move as a hopeful sign that Twitter will start to take its harassment problem more seriously.
But it’s likely more than just Yiannopoulos violating some specific rule. Twitter also stepped in because Jones, after tweeting about what she was experiencing the other night, gained enough support and publicity that the site felt like it had to step in — hence Dorsey reaching out to Jones directly. Twitter is a corporation, after all, and it is terrible PR for one of the stars of a movie that has already ignited several rounds of gender-and-culture wars to be dealing with a torrent of racist and sexist garbage at the hands of Yiannopoulos and his supporters. It’s not an accident that Yiannopoulos has repeatedly gotten away with equivalent behavior directed at much smaller names.
Either way, the claim that Twitter is engaging in a jihad against right-wing voices, that Twitter is now a “no-go zone for conservatives,” as Yiannopoulos put it to Breitbart, is laughable. Anyone who dips even a pinky toe into Twitter’s political waters knows that there is no shortage of conservative opinion on the platform, and that conservatives aren’t getting punished for expressing opinions — Black Lives Matter consists of violent anti-police radicals, Muslims are terrorists, etc. — that progressives find extremely offensive. Yiannopoulos’s suspension is far from unprecedented: The site booted Chuck C. Johnson for doxxing people — in one memorable instance, “outing” someone as “Jackie” from the University of Virginia Rolling Stone rape case who wasn’t, in fact, Jackie — and suspended Azealia Banks for what the Guardian described as directing “a number of both homophobic and racial slurs” at Zayn Malik, formerly of One Direction. In none of these three cases was the person in question suspended or banned for expressing controversial, unpopular political opinions; in all of them, they found themselves in Twitter’s crosshairs because they targeted individuals in specific, malicious ways that undeniably make the platform a worse and more toxic place.
But even if Yiannopoulos’s banning isn’t strictly unprecedented, it’s still a near-unique occurrence, involving as it did a bunch of famous onlookers, and not necessarily a sign of anything when it comes to Twitter’s future plans regarding harassment.
From Twitter’s perspective, there’s a certain corporate logic to remaining as vague as possible about which offenses are and aren’t ban-worthy. As soon as Twitter lays down more specific rules, after all, it actually has to enforce them, and said enforcement comes with various costs, both in terms of enforcement resources and users leaving or becoming less active on the platform. From a coldly corporate perspective, there’s a case to be made that it’s in Twitter’s best interest to allow as much discourse as possible, including much that is offensive — for liberals and conservatives alike to feel free to push at the boundaries of acceptable conversation without the risk of punishment. And that is, in fact, the site as it currently exists, the hysterics of Yiannopoulos and his fanboys notwithstanding.
Yes, some people are getting so turned off by Twitter’s deserted-park-with-a-bat-and-pervert-problem issues that they are leaving or disengaging, and I can personally attest to the company’s slowness in responding to complaints about tweets that are screamingly, obviously abusive. Plus, Twitter has been very slow to implement the sorts of technical tweaks that would make it easier to at least temporarily render a wave of abuse invisible — tweaks that wouldn’t involve a Twitter employee having to decide, on a tweet-by-tweet basis, what is and isn’t offensive enough to warrant action.
Overall, though, it seems clear that Twitter has made a calculated determination that if it instituted much stricter, much more tightly enforced speech guidelines tomorrow, it would likely lose far more users than it currently is to harassment. Today, it takes a special kind of asshole to actually get banned from Twitter.

Created by gaming company Razer , the product will reportedly launch online this evening. Apps for both iOS and Android devices are said to be coming along in the next week, according to the Verge. RazerGo will integrate directly into the Pokémon Go app and let users chat with other players with a preset geographic radius. (Think Tinder.) There will be options for both public chat groups and private messages, as well as chatting up other members of your chosen team. If I played Pokémon Go, here is where I’d insert a choice “Go Team Whatever!” (Editor’s note: Instinct.)
The app launch coincides with an event at Razer’s store in San Francisco, a Pokécrawl (gag), which promises plenty of lures if you’re in the area and hoping to go hunting. (More info on the event here.) Alternatively, you could just speak, out loud, to the throngs of people also wandering the streets staring at their phones in search of a Squirtle and bypass the chat app entirely.
Instead of swapping faces, as in the popular Snapchat filter, they’ll swap wedding rings in the traditional wedding ceremony! Today, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel and supermodel Miranda Kerr officially announced their engagement — and, no, not user engagement! A spokesperson told The Daily Mail: “They are extremely happy.”
We wish the two many happy Memories for years to come. Snapchat Stories may only last 24 hours, but love lasts a lifetime.
The pair have kept their snap streak up, figuratively, while dating for roughly two years after meeting at a Louis Vuitton dinner in 2014. They recently purchased a $12 million mansion in California. I guess neither of them was planning on “ghost”-ing! (Snapchat’s logo is a ghost silhouette.)
Last January, Kerr said of Spiegel, “He’s 25, but he acts like he’s 50. He’s not out partying … We don’t go out. We’d rather be at home and have dinner, go to bed early.” You could say the couple “filters” out everything else!
Today, Wednesday, July 20, in the year of our Lord Nintendo, Jeff Bezos (of Amazon and Washington Post fame) joined Vine. And while recent reports have indicated that the seven-second platform is losing its former glory among the teens who drove it to prominence, if anyone can save Vine and engage high schoolers, it is Jeff Bezos dressed as a blue-faced alien wearing a tunic and eating mashed potatoes and peas.
Bezos has a cameo appearance in the upcoming Star Trek Beyond film, so the costume was likely a one-time deal. But honestly, I hope he keeps at it with the weirdo Vines. Cheers, Jeff.
“Who?” might be the defining question of the social-media age. In your daily web-browsing habits — loading Twitter, scrolling through Instagram, scanning Facebook’s Trending Topics — how often do you come across a headline or an article or a caption where you have literally no idea who they’re talking about? It’s not just you! Don’t worry! No one does. Welcome to the world of Whos.
How to Spot a Who
The Rise of the Whos
How can you tell a Who from a Them? The obvious rule of thumb is: If you have to ask, it’s a Who. But the truth is, discerning Whos from Thems is an art as much as it is a science, and even if you listen to our podcast every week, it can be hard to keep track of who counts as a Who and who as a Them. What follows are some clues to determine whether the semi-celebrity currently appearing in your Facebook feed is a Who or a Them.
“Who?” is a question we find ourselves asking a lot these days, as the formerly tiered world of celebrities has split into two nebulous categories: Whos and Thems. In fact, we’re so concerned with this phenomenon that we host a podcast called Who? Weekly, where we attempt to map the vast Who-niverse. Allow us to attempt to explain the Who phenomenon.
The rise of Whos has been aided by the internet’s attention-based advertising economy. In today’s unlimited, always-on news environment, publications have found themselves in need of an uninterrupted stream of gossip to satisfy the demands of their readers and advertisers. The universally known celebrities of the monoculture can only provide so much. And so outlets like TMZ, Us Weekly, and E! Online, have begun to drill into a vast untapped store of gossip: the Whos. Who gossip isn’t high-quality, but it adequately fills the gaps between more features on the more substantial Thems. For every Blake and Gwen, there are scores of Doves and Ryans.
D-list celebrities are as old as time itself, but until very recently, it was possible to avoid them entirely. Now that we’ve all been thrown together on — and get our news from — enormous social platforms with seamless, instantaneous sharing, it’s more likely than ever that we’ll be confronted with stories about people who sound made up. The traditional A-list-to-D-list hierarchy no longer makes sense when people whose names you’ve never heard before are trending on a social networks with hundreds of millions of users. Instead, the subjects of gossip coverage can be divided into two categories: Whos (as in: *furrows brow* Who?) and Thems (as in: “Oh, them.”)
Whos must have their “major” credits pointed out.
Whos get press for wearing clothes.
Ever seen a tabloid story in which someone is featured picking their kids up from school? Holding a carton of Tropicana in the supermarket while in full glam? “Looking Healthy in a Bikini”? Wearing a yellow T-shirt and doing … nothing else? Thems get press for doing their jobs: acting, singing, cavorting with models. Whos get press for doing anything but their jobs — wearing clothes, eating at restaurants, and standing outside on the street — because who can even tell what their jobs are.
This is the most obvious rule, because the single unquestionable defining quality of a Who is that the immediate response to any piece of news about them is: “Who?” Tabloids and gossip outlets will always attempt to head off this reaction by including the Who’s major credit in the headline or suffocatingly contracted tweet: “Why #TeenMomOG’s @MaciBookoutMTV chose the name Maverick Reed for her third child, tweets Us Weekly. Thems, by virtue of being thems, rarely need to be identified. (Imagine a headline that needed to refer to Angelina Jolie as “actress Angelina Jolie,” for example.)
Whos sell crappy things on social media.
At this point both Whos and Thems use their Instagram and Twitter accounts to hock everything from flat-tummy teas to smile whiteners. So how can you tell the difference between the two? From the frequency of the telltale #spon hashtag, and the quality of the brand. Whos will attach their names to whatever comes along — Mother’s Day gift baskets, say, or skinny tea. Jersey Shore’s JWoww sells waist trainers, Kardashian-adjacent Scott Disick sells teeth whiteners, Housewives’ Lisa Rinna sells a ‘fabfitfun’ box – whatever that is. Thems, if they shill at all, do so only for big brands, and often without even showing their faces.
Pretty much everyone in Daily Mail is a Who.
Looking for Whos? Just head on over to Daily Mail, the Who publication of record. At the Mail, which aims for the broadest possible audience, even the occasional Them is covered as a Who. No one covers the banality of everyday celebrity life like Daily Mail: “From snow to desert! Rachel Zoe flies out of Aspen ahead of Coachella weekend swapping the ski fields for a plethora of poolside parties”; “We knew you were Wilde but … Olivia exposes nipple in vampy see-through dress as she goes braless in NYC”; “Putting it all behind her! DJ Tigerlily shows off her toned torso in crop top and skinny jeans as she steps out for the first time following nude Snapchat scandal.” By the time you get the end of a Daily Mail headline, you’re bound to forget who you were even talking about. Endless coverage of nip slips, baby bumps, and entire articles written solely around a single Instagram make Daily Mail one of the best places to sniff out Whos.
Whos can be mined from almost anywhere, but the greatest Who reserve known to mankind is reality TV. The number-one, surefire sign you are a Who? If you are famous for competing on a reality-TV competition that you didn’t win. Think Housewives of New Jersey Who Caroline Manzo, or Rock of Love Who Daisy de La Hoya.Yes, winners are often themselves Whos, but the losers and runners-up move from American Idol and its brethren to an inexplicable and endless Whodom unlike any other. (The one exception: Jennifer Hudson.)
Whos saw Hamilton on Broadway after Meryl Streep.
Whos are on reality TV competitions — but they never win.
Okay, Whos are bigger in Brazil?
Suuuuure.
This is true.
Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton is the hottest ticket on Broadway. After the show opened, in the summer of 2015, some of the biggest names in entertainment began flocking to the Richard Rogers theatre to witness the phenomenon, claim the reserved VIP seats, and get the requisite selfie with Miranda, who would post photos night after night. But like all hot tickets, there is a peak, and this one came with Meryl — one of the world’s last true Thems. By March, when Miranda posed with #DWTS’ Julianne Hough and #GreaseLive’s Vanessa Hudgens, it was clear: The most famous people in Hollywood had already taken their shot. If you saw Hamilton after Streep, you missed the cutoff.
Whos are “bigger in Europe.”
Self-explanatory.
Whos are likely named Rita Ora.
The middle finger was displayed by Pikachu’s right hand; the left hand, when raised, appears to show no middle finger. It’s possible that the bird was displayed in error, but officials (me) have reviewed the footage and ruled that, accidental or not, this is Pikachu giving the middle finger to a bunch of baseball fans.
To make matters worse, the site — which has continually struggled to serve ads that don’t annoy the crap out of users — launched ads that autoplay audio in users’ dashboards this week.
Pikachu, get it together …
But Tumblr users are passionate about the site almost because of its flaws, not in spite of them. For all of its problems, it’s the best social network for rallying around fandoms, to what occasionally seems like an unhealthy degree.
And that, among other things, is why it won’t shut down soon, and certainly not overnight. According to stats provided by the company, there are more than 300 million Tumblrs on the platform (the number of active users was unspecified), and the key demo of young people under 34 makes up 50 percent of their audience.
Swiping into the subway is a pain. Remember the time Hillary Clinton tried to do it like 12 times and just couldn’t get it quite right? Across the pond, the London Underground, or Tube, system uses cards with RFID microchips that let users hold the card up to a reader to gain access. Easier, yes, but the system still requires you keep track of a card at all times.
Lucie Davis, a 22-year-old jewelry-design student from London created this fingernail set as a school project, she explained on Instagram. The RFID chip is hidden within the nail, covered by a blue-and-white paint job which mimics the designs on a standard Oyster Card (the prepaid and refillable card Tube riders use). Technically, the nails violate a Transport of London rule which prohibits removing an RFID chip from an Oyster Card, CNET reports, and I’m not sure fake nails, with their penchant for breaking off, are the ideal location for embedding an important piece of tech. Still, points for innovation.
You can control the volume and change songs on the frame, and even take phone calls. The best part? No one else can hear the music you’re playing.
Alternatively, you could just pry the microchip out of the card and embed it in a set of acrylic fingernails, so that every time you wave your hand the entrance gates bow to your technological power.
Yesterday evening, Tesla CEO Elon Musk finally revealed his much-hyped “master plan” for the company. The plan, announced via blog post on the Tesla website, is a follow-up on the original master plan Musk penned back in 2006. (Some of what Musk outlined in his first plan is still yet to happen, like building an affordable car. The Tesla Model 3, ringing in at $35,000, is still the brand’s cheapest vehicle.) Here’s what Musk has planned for the future.
Engineer the perfect “solar-roof-with-battery” product.
Tesla SUVs and pickup trucks coming soon to a highway near you.
In addition to the three existing Tesla models, Musk says the company plans to start putting several other types of vehicles on the road and is upping its production game. “Tesla engineering has transitioned to focus heavily on designing the machine that makes the machine — turning the factory itself into a product.” (Okay, Elon.) The company will also be unveiling “heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport” systems in the coming years.
Autonomous cars that are ten times safer than human drivers.
Currently, Tesla’s autopilot system is still in beta mode. Musk says the company is working rapidly to remove that label and will do so only when the technology makes riding in a self-driving car ten times safer than “the average American vehicle.” Musk anticipates self-driving tech becoming regulated and accepted as the norm after it has been used for over six billion miles. Currently, self-driving cars are averaging three million miles per day.
As previously announced, Musk plans to acquire SolarCity (a plan that was met with mixed reviews and dipping Tesla stock prices). Musk says that the merger is imperative if Tesla is to build a “solar-roof-with-battery product that just works.”
Ride sharing for everybody.
Musk envisions a world where you can call up your Tesla at the push of a button and it will come get you. “Once it picks you up, you will be able to sleep, read or do anything else enroute to your destination.” (Where do I sign up?) But when you’re not napping or doing Bikram yoga in your Tesla, you’ll also be able to charge other people to use your car as part of a “shared fleet.” “This will dramatically lower the true cost of ownership to the point where almost anyone could own a Tesla.” (Which is good, because Musk notes that a vehicle less expensive than the Model 3 is unlikely.)
For the past few days, people in Melbourne, Australia, have been paying their respects to the late, great Taylor Swift, who was bodied beyond recognition by Kim Kardashian West on Sunday. A large mural memorializing Swift popped up in a Melbourne alley over the weekend — sure, the mural technically says “Taylor Smith,” but we all know who most needs our mourning today.
Another heavy user I spoke with expressed similar nonchalance. “The reaction from the platform users feels overblown. Everyone is freaking out and providing resources on how to back up your blog, but nothing truly disappears on the internet, so is there really all that much to fear?” they said. “People hate change and that’s what they’re reacting to here, as they do anytime Tumblr changes the tiniest detail of their experience.” Tumblr fans are notoriously finicky about design changes and often turn UI tweaks into memes of their own.
The artist, known on Instagram as Lushsux, claims to have received a legal threat from Team Smith — I mean, Team Swift — and has returned to give the memorial a face-lift. Now, if you visit Hosier Lane, you won’t find a tribute to the woman who once tried to trademark the phrase “Nice to Meet You, Where You Been?” Instead, the memorial has been redesigned to honor Harambe, the lowland gorilla shot at the Cincinnati Zoo in May, who’s since become a meme trope on Twitter and Facebook.
“A cartoon gorilla face was painted over Swift’s in memory of ‘Harambe,’” the Daily Mail writes. Not … quite. A meme-trained eye should recognize the underbite and furrowed brow as Primitive Sponge, the spring’s hottest SpongeBob SquarePants meme. (If you haven’t met the porous meme yet, read our usage guide here.) Coincidentally, Primitive Sponge is also dead, a victim of the vicious internet meme cycle. A big RIP to all three.
At some point during the RNC, a terrible thing happened. It wasn’t Laura Ingraham’s, um, salute or even Ted Cruz ignoring the pledge and going entirely rogue. No. Amidst the festivities, Ivanka Trump, daughter of one Donald Trump, lost an earring.
Annabelle has been aggressively @ing members of the Trump family and key RNC players on Twitter, but thus far doesn’t seem to be making much headway. As of publication, her original tweet had only been shared about 40 times. (Though Twitter just turned her earring find into a “Moment,” so it’s only a matter of time.) Ivanka, if you’re reading this and you truly did lose an earring, please come and collect your jewelry.
Now, an Ohio college student, Annabelle Marie, is trying to return the earring to Trump so that it may once again hang regally upon her $150-million-net-worth lobe. She claims she found the earring at the convention center on Wednesday evening. (Though it appears Trump actually wore the earring in question on Tuesday night.)
Points to Annabelle for not just immediately pocketing the earring or selling it on eBay. Then again, what is worth more: a single diamond earring or a few minutes of internet fame?
Update: The earring has been returned.

Tonight, Silicon Valley billionaire and free-press nemesis Peter Thiel will give a speech at the Republican National Convention. What will he say? Why will he say it? Will he formally announce the creation of a floating libertarian island outside the federal government’s purview? All three of those are equally important questions that are difficult to answer definitively.
Tech journalists are particularly concerned with figuring out why Thiel — a Republican, sure, but a member of the Silicon Valley tribe — has decided to so publicly support an ethno-nationalist revanchist who stands against so much of what the tech industry believes itself to be for. At Recode, Kara Swisher argues that Thiel is following his own contrarian instincts, and embracing the destructive potential of a Trump administration to “blow [the economic system] up completely as is Thiel’s bent.” After all, Thiel literally believes that core principles of our system of government are flawed. In a famous piece for the Cato Institute in 2009, the investor wrote, “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.”
There are a few knowns. Thiel will speak “frankly.” Okay! According to Bloomberg, he will also speak explicitly about being gay — a first for an RNC speaker — and will criticize the party for its outsized focus on identity politics. On the flip side, he’ll say that Trump is good with money.
Jeff Bercovici makes the point even more explicitly at Inc.: “I think Peter Thiel supports Donald Trump because he believes it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to weaken America’s attachment to democratic government.” In other words: The ultimate disruption is to disrupt American democracy itself. It’s a magnificent act of sabotage that only someone worth billions could comfortably ride out. “It’s easy to imagine,” Bercovici writes, “a Trump presidency leading to a constitutional crisis or mass protests that would leave the executive branch, and perhaps the entire federal government, significantly weakened.”
Thiel’s eagerness for destructive change, and his affection for disruptive politics, could explain his fealty to Trump. But maybe we’re all overthinking it a little bit. Maybe Thiel just likes being rich and wants to get even richer. Trump’s policies, disastrous as they would be for many, could likely benefit Thiel’s current investments, most notably, the secretive data-analysis firm Palantir. From the aforementioned Bloomberg piece:
Last month on Select All, we argued, similarly, that Thiel may actually support Trump because he believes in Trump as a candidate — that Thiel’s peculiar brand of “alt-right”-adjacent post-politics is in harmony with Trump’s Establishment-hating strongman program, such as it exists.
Thiel’s shown a flair for investing in companies that rely in part on government largesse, or at least on close relationships with government programs. NASA’s already awarded important contracts to SpaceX, another company Thiel’s invested in; AltSchool, a Thiel-backed education start-up, would love to sell its proprietary software to the public-school system. And the odds on Thiel’s bet on widely criticized health-insurance company Oscar, which exists to capitalize on Obamacare’s insurance mandate (and subsidies), are only likely to improve in a Trump White House — Oscar’s founder Josh Kushner is Ivanka’s brother-in-law, after all. The tech industry as a whole might suffer under a Trump administration. But the guy looking for government contracts after offering full-throated support at a convention will probably make it through okay.
Of course, making an array of government-aided investments is hardly unique among the ultrawealthy, and pledging support to candidates in the hopes of favorable treatment later is as old as democratic politics itself. But that’s just another reason to fall back on Occam’s razor to explain Thiel’s Trump support: First and foremost, Peter Thiel wants to make money. After all, being insanely wealthy is a pretty good way to escape the grasp of government’s clammy hands. And if, at the same time, he can blow up democracy by installing a monarchical tyrant at the top of the executive branch, well, that’s just a bonus.
The subject of the gay fascist is, unsurprisingly, a sensitive one. Real-life fascist regimes mercilessly persecuted homosexuals, and any empirical connection between homosexuality and fascism is tenuous, despite what Christian conspiracy theorists and gay contrarians might have you believe. The gay fascist is a real historical figure — for instance, the French critic Robert Brasillach or the SA leader Ernst Röhm — but, more significantly, it’s a cultural trope, familiar from films such as Luchino Visconti’s The Damned and novels such as Jonathan Littell’s The Kindly Ones. In these works of fiction, the gay fascist, who is generally debonair, witty, and well-read, is meant to stand in for the cultural afflictions of the society that produced him: decadence, cynicism, sadism; the narcissism and aestheticism of over-civilization; the worship of death and the loss of hope in the future (associations all courted by Milo with his Twitter name, Nero).
There’s a sort of deconstruction-by-numbers which holds that the gay fascist trope is indicative of irrational fears of “disordered” sexuality, or else is a way for ordinary people to comfort themselves with the belief that fascists were moral and sexual deviants, rather than what they were: ordinary people. Both those things may well be true. But Milo’s ability to reinvent and inhabit the trope suggests something simpler.
On Tuesday, Twitter permanently banned the account of Breitbart journalist Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) for violating its “hateful conduct policy.” Milo — he goes by just the single name — was busted for trolling Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones. Although the offending tweets were not unusual by the low standards of Twitter (or of Milo himself), this was not the first time that he had gotten in trouble with the company, and by picking a fight with Jones he made her a target of even worse racist abuse from his followers. That’s the official explanation, at least, although it may give Twitter too much credit for having and enforcing a coherent policy.
Milo may have been one of the most “egregious and consistent offenders of [Twitter’s] terms of service,” but he was also one of the social-media platform’s most skilled manipulators. He established himself as a right-wing celebrity by mastering the arts of calculated provocation and self-promotion, developing a particular talent for loudly violating “politically correct” speech taboos in ways maximally calculated to rally the faithful while baiting his liberal and leftist adversaries into hysterics. A sample headline from directly after the Orlando shooting gives an idea of the genre: THE LEFT CHOSE ISLAM OVER GAYS. NOW OVER 100 PEOPLE ARE KILLED OR MAIMED IN ORLANDO. Its thrust may be abhorrent, but as a headline it’s brilliant — and it plays well on social media.
Milo is also a number of things that most conservative journalists are not. He knows his memes. He calls Donald Trump “Daddy.” He openly affiliates with the neo-monarchists and open racists of the alt-right, which he depicts as a happy-go-lucky band of internet tricksters out to poke fun at liberal pieties for the lulz. He’s gay, too. Fabulously gay. Not the sort of dignified bourgeois gay that the Republican Party has spent years begrudgingly accommodating itself to; no — Milo is a self-described “based faggot” who flirts with racism even as he tweets about his love of “black cock”; he’s the millenial gay best friend who says the most outrageous things: for instance, that gay liberation was a bad idea and it’s time to get back in the closet. With his legions of online followers and savant’s knowledge of Pepe the Frog memes, Milo seems like a singularly contemporary thinker. Yet he has also revived an older trope, which may be more indicative of our current moment: the decadent, gay, fascist sophisticate.
The point is not that this liberalism was therefore ‘illiberal.’ Rather, it’s that whatever its considerable flaws, this liberalism was in its heyday the ideology of a successful ruling class that was able to provide ever-increasing prosperity, individual autonomy, and social peace to the nations in which it ruled. Fascism is what came after, when the pointless massacre of the First World War, the economic devastation of the 1930s, and the persistent inability to resolve long-simmering social tensions discredited the European elite and its ideas. Reducing fascism to some vague idea of extreme conservatism, which in its American context essentially means angry old white people, misses the sense in which fascism prospered because it was something young, cool, transgressive, and new. For fascist intellectuals, at least, the liberal bourgeoisie was their enemy as much as were communists or Jews, and it was precisely because the bourgeois were old, self-righteous, and boring. Fascism was sexy and fun.
Milo gets this. He’s not the angry, downwardly mobile Iowan that is still the ideal-typical Trump voter. He’s young, he’s smart, he’s good-looking; his entire identity is a mockery of the family-values conservatism that until recently dominated right-wing politics in America. And he’s mastered the art of the exciting transgression. Bigoted views are bigoted views. But it’s also true that a flailing American elite has elevated a corporate-diversity-training version of multiculturalism into one of the primary justifications for its continued rule. (At one point last fall, I attended a function at Brown University — endowment $3.3 billion — at which the keynote speaker closed with: “I’m a queer black survivor, and I’m going to work at Goldman Sachs next year!” The room exploded.) Milo exploits to great effect the perception among his disaffected, youthful fan base that liberal pieties about diversity and anti-racism are just the moralistic droning of an elite losing its grip on power.
In its contemporary usage, “fascism” designates roughly any political ideology to the right of Joe Scarborough. As any college professor or message-board pedant will tell you, that’s a mistake. As an intellectual movement, fascism defined itself against 19th-century European liberalism — which espoused beliefs that 21st-century American liberals might well regard as fascist. It held (with some exceptions) that men were naturally superior to women, whites were superior to blacks, and Saxons and Teutons superior to Latins and Celts. It regarded democracy with contempt.
Trump’s success has raised among liberals a fear that the far right has made itself respectable. Milo’s success at creating a following for a figure like himself — limited as it might be — suggests that the bigger fear should be that the far right might make itself cool.
Nick Johnson claims to have caught everything from a Bulbasaur to whatever Pokémon begins with “Z” (Ed. note: Zygarde). He first posted his feat on Reddit and later caught up with Business Insider (where a friend of his is a reporter) to discuss his achievement. Technically there are 151 Pokémon in the original game, but several can only be caught outside of the U.S. and few other rare monsters are still impossible to catch, Kotaku reports. By that math, Johnson says that, at 142 Pokémon strong, his roster is as good as you can get.
He finished his quest after finally nabbing a Omastar, but says his penultimate catch, a Porygon, proved to the toughest. “I may or may not have seen it on the radar [in nearby New Jersey] and then ordered an Uber to drive me around until I found it,” Johnson, in an excellent PR move for Uber, told BI. Now that he’s done, Johnson says he’ll help his girlfriend finish her collection (ugh, men) and “probably sleep more.”

Elon Musk just released his second “master plan” for Tesla Motors, and it’s not good news for Uber. Musks wants Tesla to get in on the ride-sharing business, but doesn’t need drivers to do it.
Whatever else Peter Thiel was doing last night, he was disappointing journalists. Since it was announced last week that the PayPal founder and early Facebook investor would speak at the Republican National Convention, a sense of anticipatory excitement had descended on the technology writers who’d been covering his secret, recently revealed decade-long crusade against Gawker Media. The prospect of a tech investor who’d seemingly embraced his status as a Hearstian billionaire super-villain, speaking just two slots before a presidential candidate with whom he shares — if nothing else — a flair for the dramatic pronouncement, was too good not to milk.
Columnists speculated on Thiel’s motivations for supporting Trump, and wondered if he’d use the stage to advance tenets of his bizarro-libertarian politics. This was the man, after all, who had a tendency for advancing genuinely shocking political arguments like “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible” and “the extension of the franchise to women […] rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron.” Given a national stage like the RNC, what would he say then? Would he disparage multiculturalism? Advocate seasteading? Dismiss the idea of a free press? Would he, from the stage in Cleveland, between the G.E. Smith band and Ivanka Trump, command the wholesale and fiery destruction of liberal democracy?
As it turns out … No. Anyone hoping for the rise of a theatrical new public figure or looking for an alt-right manifesto — or even just a nod toward some of Thiel’s more outré beliefs — was treated instead to a straightforward business-leader endorsement, filled with lamentations about misplaced priorities (“Instead of going to Mars, we have invaded the Middle East”) and corny jokes (“Wall Street bankers inflate bubbles in everything from government bonds to Hillary Clinton’s speaking fees”). The most interesting moment of the speech was Thiel’s announcement (to cheers!) “I am proud to be gay” — which he moved on from by dismissing his party’s institutional hostility to that pride as “fake culture wars” that “distract us from our economic decline.” The Bond-villain super-genius version of Thiel that animated columns and op-eds — the one who sued Gawker into bankruptcy and tried to build a libertarian nation at sea — was replaced by a goofy, nervously enthusiastic businessman talking about how America was better when we went to the moon. The “dangerous and fascinating” Peter Thiel gave a boring speech.
In fact, this was the greatest effect of the speech, and almost certainly one of its intentions: to diffuse the mad-libertarian image that had attached itself to Thiel, and recast him as a boring, more-or-less acceptable Republican — someone other tech investors might disagree with, but a man well within the boundaries of normal. Thiel was able to support his preferred candidate (for whatever reason you prefer to believe he does) without alienating his friends and business partners in Silicon Valley, and his earnest, vague case for Trump — and the acknowledgment that his sexuality puts him at odds with his party — made his public persona human, and even reasonable, in a way that it hasn’t in months.
That might be disappointing to people who like their industrialists to inveigh publicly as they do privately, but it’s heartening to at least one person: Mark Zuckerberg. After a brief scandal earlier this year over the unlikely possibility that Facebook had institutionally censored or suppressed conservative news on the site, Thiel’s presence as the sole conservative on Facebook’s board is important to the company — so long as Thiel can maintain his status as an acceptable conservative, rather than a power-mad oligarch. This speech, in which he praised government technology programs of the 20th century, more than sufficed. Thiel emerged not as the neo-reaction’s first true public figure but as a boyish space enthusiast who just wants to get his country back on the right track.
So those of us hoping for a little more anti-democratic fire and quasi-fascist brimstone will just have to deal with our disappointment. But maybe not for long: Thiel is speaking next month at the conference of the Property and Freedom Society in Turkey — a gathering that attracts, in the words of Towleroad, “white supremacists and their fellow travelers,” including “libertarian extremists whose ideology creeps right up to crypto-Nazism.” Maybe he’ll be a little more forthcoming then.
Last night, as Donald Trump accepted the GOP nomination for president, Hillary Clinton did some campaigning of her own in Cleveland … on Snapchat. The presumed Democratic nominee purchased a temporary geofilter (an image overlay that can only be accessed in a specific area) for the convention center and delivered a sick burn using Trump’s own words against him.
She’s not the first candidate to use Snapchat filters this election cycle. Bernie Sanders, bless his soul, had one in New York City during the Democratic primary earlier this year and Clinton’s campaign has run a few others during the RNC. But this filter trumps them all. (Sorry.)
Yesterday, as U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby gave his daily press briefing in Washington, a rogue Pidgey entered the pressroom. Kirby was unaware — until he noticed a reporter in the briefing who was playing Pokémon Go while he spoke.
Last week, in a sequence that felt like it should have been soundtracked with “Yakety Sax,” Donald Trump announced Mike Pence as his vice-presidential pick, gifting the world with a slightly erotic campaign logo and a running mate with an odd distaste for the animated Disney classic Mulan. Hillary Clinton, days away from the Democratic National Convention, has not yet announced her number-two pick. Unless, maybe, you’re paying very close attention to Wikipedia edits.
But who needs secret sources and political connections when you have Wikipedia? The people’s encyclopedia. The free encyclopedia. The encyclopedia my teachers spent years telling me never to trust as a research source that I am now pointing to as intel for one of the country’s biggest questions.
As radio producer Nick Andersen notes on Twitter, taking a look at the edit history on the Wiki pages for potential VP picks is telling. Each page on Wikipedia shows how many updates have been made to it, who made them, and when. For example, if you look at Tom Vilsack’s page you’ll find about 40 edits since the beginning of July, from a number of different Wikipedia users. The bulk of those happened earlier this week, on July 20, the same day Vilsack was named, alongside Perez and Kaine, by the Associated Press as a top-three contender for the gig. Now, the edits have dropped off.
Meanwhile, on Tim Kaine’s Wikipedia page, edits abound. Roughly 100 changes have been made since Monday, over half of those on Friday alone.
For the past month or so, the popular video game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been at the center of a gambling scandal which has already taken down several popular streamers and websites. Players are gambling with virtual weapons that have real cash values, leading to an online economy that some claim is basically equivalent to dealing in cash itself. If I were, say, a Fox News producer, the chyron would read “Teen Trend: Black-Market Arms-Dealing.”
People can buy and sell weapon skins, designs that change weapon appearances, using real money, and can then resell them to other players. A recent Bloomberg report described it simply:
Dozens of sites exist that allow Steam users to connect their accounts (and thus their CS:GO inventory) and then place their virtual weapons into betting pools — sites with names like CSGO Lotto and CSGO Casino. Oftentimes, the people using these websites are under the age of 18, but because the activity doesn’t fit the legal definition of cash gambling, their status is more dubious than outright criminal — like vaping. (Valve is currently facing lawsuits over its marketplace.)
https://youtu.be/_8fU2QG-lV0
At the same time that Martin and Cassell were trying to claim that they hadn’t misled viewers, another streamer named PsiSyndicate claimed that he had made a deal with one such gambling site, Steam Lotto, to rig the lottery in his favor. He’d claim to have won great prizes on the site by chance, when in fact he had received the winnings in exchange for promotion to his 500,000-plus followers on YouTube. He was like a 21st-century version of the plant who wins at three-card monte right before some sucker shows up to watch.
Earlier this week, James “PhantomL0rd” Varga (great user-name), who has 1.3 million followers on Twitch, was banned from the service after it was alleged that he owned a stake in another gambling site, CS:GOShuffle. Yesterday, members of FaZe Clan, one of the most popular gaming leagues online, were called out for conspiring with the website CSGO Wild. The site’s co-owner Gagey, said in a message that members of FaZe “were paid in cash, skins, and emeralds to be used to bet with on our website.” The deal ended when CSGO Wild stopped serving U.S.-based customers. Presumably, if you’re not in the U.S., you’re still getting played.
CS:GO, as it’s known, has been wildly successful for its developer and publisher, Valve, the same company that runs Steam, the de facto digital-distribution service for PC gaming. They get a cut of every transaction on the service. According to the service’s real-time statistics, there are more than 450,000 people playing the game right now. Bloomberg reported that more than $2.3 billion worth of weapon skins were wagered on e-sports matches in 2015.
CS:GO has a large e-sports community, and many of its best players are also popular streamers who display their prowess for fans on sites like Twitch and YouTube. A couple of weeks ago, it was revealed that two popular YouTubers — Trevor Martin and Thomas Cassell, known as TmarTn and ProSyndicate, respectively — were key figures in CSGO Lotto. They heavily promoted the site on their channels without any sort of disclosure that Martin was the site’s president and Cassell its VP. That seems like a thing they should have disclosed!
In response to this whole mess, Valve has started taking legal action against the sites. Last week, Valve employee Erik Johnson posted an update, writing:
While technically true, interest in the gambling sites has obviously encouraged more players to purchase CS:GO itself and to buy and sell weapons. Valve has definitely profited off of them indirectly. Not speaking out against the gambling sites has been a very effective tactic for getting teenagers to buy their Terrorist Gun Boys Simulator.
This week, the company sent cease and desists to 23 sites, claiming that they had violated the Steam Subscriber Agreement by using the API to build virtual gambling venues, and hoping to quash the issue once and for all.
This entire hydra-headed scandal has exposed something that has been known for a long time but often goes unstated (or understated): Popular streamers are often compensated by the companies and products that they cover. The Let’s Play and e-sports genres of online video have exploded from mere curiosity into a sponsored-content economy in which the largest personalities can charge for placement or set up schemes to bilk viewers. The Counter-Strike mess will cast a long shadow over streamers for a long time.
Most of the edits come from a Wikipedia editor under the name “Neutrality,” an account responsible for making thousands of edits across the entire Wikipedia site. The account was awarded a Barnstar (Wikipedia awards for users who go above and beyond the nonexistent call of free-encyclopedia duty) for making numerous key edits to the Wikipedia page for the Republican National Convention earlier this week.
In 2008, the Washington Post reported that prior to John McCain announcing Sarah Palin as his running mate, her Wikipedia page saw a similar amount of editing activity. But back then, the same users editing Palin’s page were also simultaneously updated McCain’s, which isn’t the case with Kaine and Clinton, The Atlantic notes. The most likely explanation is that Wikipedia power-users are just prepping Kaine’s page following the breadcrumb trail left by media reports citing “Democrats close to Hillary Clinton” naming Kaine as the odds-on favorite — but we regard futures markets as reasonably accurate prediction models, and surely power-user edit triage is a sort of mangled futures market? That, or somebody just really wanted to make sure “Richmond” was spelled correctly in every paragraph.
Clinton’s campaign tweeted today that she would be announcing “soon,” and if you text their given number you’ll be the first to know. (And then they’ll also have your cell-phone number.) Several names have been bandied about over the last few months — Tom Vilsack, Cory Booker, Tim Kaine, Tom Perez, Elizabeth Warren — with that list dwindling down over the past few days. Kaine, a senator from Virginia, and the longtime front-runner, has emerged as the “likely” pick, according to sources close to the campaign.
“You’re playing the Pokémon thing right there, aren’t you,” Kirby asked from the podium, using the term my mother also uses to describe the game. The reporter replied that he was just “keeping an eye on it.” Okay. Sure.
Kirby continued discussing actual issues, i.e., global terror, only to return to the reporter later in the briefing to ask if he’d managed to catch anything. (In a sentence that I hope is the only time I will hear “Daesh” and a reference to Pokémon Go together ever again.) “No,” the reporter told Kirby, according to the official transcript of the briefing. “The signal is not very good.”
In the last few years, it’s been disturbingly common for angry corners of the gamer internet to tee off on video-game-company employees they blame for whatever they’re annoyed at at the moment: narrative choices, character design, or whatever else.
Summing up just a handful of these incidents, Polygon’s Colin Campbell writes:
Unsurprisingly, these attacks seem to be particularly heated when the controversy in question involves race, gender, or progressive politics — there is still a coterie of gamers who feel like their hobby is being “stolen” from them by “SJWs.” (That’s not to say there aren’t also uproars over obscure, nerdy debates that don’t map easily onto the culture wars, of course.)
That silence is pretty weird. It’s such a softball question, such an easy way to score some quick and easy PR points. Just off the top of my head: “JesseCo will not tolerate any online or offline harassment of our employees, who have a right to feel safe. Since harassment takes so many forms, and there’s no one-size-fits-all response, we handle each incident on a case-by-case basis, meeting with the victimized employee to make sure they have the resources and support they need, and, where necessary, bringing in the assistance of law enforcement.”
In light of all this, Campbell sent 25 “games companies and trade organizations” a simple query: “Please can you share with us how [your company] plans to deal with any situation in which an employee comes under abuse, doxxing or threatening messages. Alternatively, please let us know what steps you are currently taking to tackle this issue.” He only got responses from six — CCP (the Icelandic company behind Eve Online), Electronic Arts, Gearbox, Nintendo, Microsoft, and the International Game Developers Association.
So why are companies remaining tight-lipped on this? One company’s retracted response offers a hint:
In other words, it might be the case that these companies understand that some of the people doing the harassing are their loyal customers, and that any public statement condemning said harassment will cause these (easily offended) customers offense. In the corner of the gaming subculture responsible for this behavior, after all, even acknowledging that this sort of harassment is a problem — rather than believing Gamergate and its ilk are reasonable and necessary grassroots movement against the politicization and feminization of gaming — is seen as a sign that one has been brainwashed by the SJWs.
Is this definitely what’s going on? No. But it’s still very weird that Campbell got so few responses. Issuing an anodyne statement about doxing and harassment should be the easiest thing in the world for a company to do.
This morning, WikiLeaks released a searchable archive of more than 19,000 emails from the Democratic National Committee. Who knows what sort of skeletons and untold secrets are lurking in the digital inboxes of of the DNC?
There’s all sorts of political infighting happening in these archives. According to the Intercept, emails appear to point to certain officials considering using Bernie Sanders’s Jewishness as a tool against him.
And also, one person told another person to “eat my butt.”
In a follow-up, the person told to eat butt appears to yell at a third party named Clayton, cc:’d.
In the third part of this captivating trilogy, the initial account that suggested “eat my butt” replies, “Gross.”
Presumably, the first message was sent from the original account as a prank by the Clayton mentioned in the second message. We’ve reached out to all parties involved about this five-word whirlwind, and will update if we hear back.
Last week, WikiLeaks released 19,000 emails from the Democratic National Committee, apparently lifted by Russian-government hackers. The document dump was a feast for journalists, activists, and close students of the political process: There were discussions of donut licking and butt eating — revelations so powerful that DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned yesterday. But amidst the rubble of a unified Democratic Party, a hero has emerged: Pablo Manriquez, a former DNC media booker.
TechCrunch also reported last week that AOL has been in a sort of holding pattern over the potential of a Yahoo purchase
According to Recode, Verizon plans to combine Yahoo with AOL, which it purchased last year for $4.4 billion. That would create a relatively robust editorial organization and, more important, a formidable ad tech department. The pitch to Yahoo’s board was reportedly that Verizon is best equipped to take on Facebook and Google in the online ad space.
Telecommunications giant Verizon has purchased lumbering dot-com veteran Yahoo for a reported $4.8 billion — just a small reduction from the $44.6 billion offer Microsoft reportedly made for the company in 2008. The deal will finally end the months of rumor and speculation, and years of pity and tongue clicks, about Yahoo, once one of the web’s biggest names, and increasingly a punch line.
The company has struggled under CEO Marissa Mayer to reverse its fortunes. Neither its aggressive push into original video and editorial, nor the $1 billion purchase of Tumblr, the teen-friendly blogging platform — just one of scores of companies bought by Mayer — did much to save Yahoo. Sources told Bloomberg last week that the purchase includes Yahoo’s core internet business, as well as some of the company’s real-estate assets. Yahoo will keep control over its stakes in companies like Asian e-commerce giant Alibaba. The deal doesn’t include intellectual property like patents, arguably some of the most important holdings in Yahoo’s possession.
The question is if a major infrastructure company, with a corporate culture that reflects its age and particular business model, can efficiently operate software companies like AOL and Yahoo — let alone compete against much bigger ones. Right now, as large as the Verizon-AOL-Yahoo Voltron is, it’s still a distant third.
In one exchange that’s making the rounds on Twitter, Pablo goes head to head with his colleagues about a CNN appearance. From the emails, it seems that the appearance was scheduled for six a.m., but one of Manriquez’s colleagues wanted to pull a last-minute switch.
Google and Facebook dominate the internet’s advertising business because they control the two biggest portals through which people experience the internet. Google sells ads against search results, Facebook sells targeted ads based on user interest profiles compiled from activity on Facebook. It’s difficult to truly compete with them unless one controlled a similarly gargantuan platform. Like, say, a nationwide telecommunications infrastructure. As one of the country’s largest mobile providers, Verizon is a first-party platform owner, and it’s arguably better positioned than Google or Facebook because it can track its users (whose names, addresses, and Social Security numbers it knows) on the device level. (Facebook and Google can only really track users while they’re signed in to those platforms.) And Verizon’s now scooped up two large advertising businesses that can be wielded more effectively in house.
So why buy Yahoo at all? In a letter to employees — posted on Tumblr — Mayer wrote that the sale is “a great opportunity for Yahoo to build further distribution and accelerate our work in mobile, video, native advertising, and social. As one of the largest wireless and cable companies in the world, Verizon opens the door to extensive distribution opportunities.”
“Yahoo and AOL popularized the Internet, email, search and real-time media,” Mayer said in the press release. “It’s poetic to be joining forces with AOL and Verizon as we enter our next chapter focused on achieving scale on mobile.”
Pablo, however, wants to stick with the predetermined plan.
From there, things start to get heated.
But Pablo, our intrepid hero, fights back.
It seems to work and one of the people in the email chain jumps, begrudgingly, to team Pablo.
Not everyone was sold, but in the end it appears, at least on this day, good (Pablo) triumphed over evil (everyone else on this terrible thread.)
Pablo kindly volunteers to staff the appearance himself.
Simply point the pen’s scanner at a color and it’s replicated on paper, or a digital tablet. Scribble allows you to replicate colors from food, makeup, and even your pets.
Cool, right?
This email exchange dates to May 17. A quick search of the WikiLeaks emails for “Pablo” brings up an email discussing Pablo’s mysterious absence on May 10, “if we’re rewarding his incompetence/insubordination by taking him off of sunday rotation, least we can do is would make him do more monitoring.” By May 24, Pablo had sent out an email that he was quitting his role at the DNC and invited his colleagues to a going-away happy hour. And that was the end of Pablo at the DNC.
It is not well received.
But not the end of Pablo. Pablo’s urgent advocacy, his clear-eyed pleading, and his co-workers’ creative insults, have launched Pablo into viral mini-fame, as a quick search of the hashtag #ImWithPablo will reveal.
Now, it seems the only thing Pablo still lacks is a verified Twitter. Though at the rate he’s been tweeting about it, it should only be a matter of time.
And Pablo, true to form, has leaned into his internet fame by chatting with his new fans, and retweeting their compliments. (Also, in case you were wondering, he’s single.)
The Democratic National Convention kicks off today, but please, bro, don’t try to vape inside. E-cigarettes are on the list of items people are prohibited from bringing to the Philadelphia event this week.
Perhaps it’s because the Democratic delegates would prefer to cast their votes unobscured by wafts of vapor, or maybe it’s because somebody on the DNC planning committee got picked last for dodgeball in middle school, but either way, vapes are a no-go. (Alternatively, it’s because the devices have been known to violently explode without warning.) Also on the forbidden list: selfie sticks, balloons, toy guns, real guns, and drones.
Last week’s Republican National Convention did not appear to have any restrictions on vapes (tennis balls and grappling hooks, however, were not permitted.) So if you were hoping to get your political process and chill on, hopefully you were in attendance.
New York City is currently trapped under a “heat dome,” which sounds like a Stephen King sequel and makes being outside feeling akin to walking on the sun. (More realistically, weekend temperatures peaked at a lovely 96 degrees. But you get my drift, it’s toasty.)
To combat this heat wave, please spend the next two minutes and 39 seconds watching this team of Japanese men perform a water ballet to “Let It Go” from Frozen. I know you probably only just got 2013’s inescapable earworm out of your head, but I assure you, this is worth it. Their aquatic feats of beauty and grace are rivaled only by Esther Williams. Also, it’s just funny.
The video itself dates to 2014 and only has about 700,000 YouTube views. But thanks to the constant churn of the internet, it’s making a comeback today at the top of Imgur, because somebody refused to let it go. (I’ll show myself out now.)
Twitter is worried you don’t know what Twitter is. Twitter wants to correct this issue and welcome you all into the warm embrace of Twitter. Twitter wants to convince you it can still be your best friend even if you don’t tweet. In a blog post today, the company announced 90 percent of people surveyed “globally recognize the Twitter brand” (good), but that not everyone in that percentage actually, you know, gets Twitter, which could translate to fewer active users (less good).
Last Friday, WikiLeaks unleashed a trove of nearly 20,000 emails from the Democratic National Committee, the fallout of which has already brought down party chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. As Motherboard points out, signs that the DNC was infiltrated have been percolating over the last couple of months, and there are signs that the documents passed through Russian intelligence before appearing on the site. The release was initially attributed to supposed hacktivist Guccifer 2.0, a highly suspect pseudonym.
The ability to turn document caches into fodder for public debate has the potential to turn general email communication into a dangerous tool. Intelligence agencies have been spying on other countries for nearly a century, but relatively speaking, only a small percentage of gathered intelligence is actionable. (Russia’s intelligence agencies, to name one example, do not particularly care about Pablo, the DNC media booker.) But the realization that even the most boring of communications can be deeply damaging — as the Sony hack and subsequent email release demonstrated — makes the dump a powerful weapon.
Before the internet, the publicly accessible, easily searchable document dump didn’t exist. Journalists might receive large caches of documents, but they’d act as sieves, filtering out (what they believed to be) the important stuff before it was passed on to the public. Even since the dump has become a common news event over the last few years, helped along by Wikileaks and similar operations, the actual document caches have still largely been consumed through the work of reporters and analysts, as in the December 2014 Sony hack or the recent Panama Papers hack. Consequently, those dumps have lived and died on reporters’ ability to find stories in them that have traction with readers.
By now, though, the public — especially the social-media-using public — is familiar with the dump as a format, and while high-profile stories can help drive coverage, they’re not necessary for a document dump to have real impact. Stories from the DNC dump, with a few notable exceptions, have largely been pointed out and distributed through Twitter and other social media, thanks to Wikileaks’ indexed and searchable database. People who were once outside observers can make themselves part of the story, digging through emails themselves to find interesting or mundane tidbits.
“The Dump” has come of age.
Everyone’s a target — especially nongovernmental organizations
The Democratic National Committee is a great target for hackers precisely because it’s the sort of government-affiliated nongovernmental organization that touches many important events and people without requiring state-quality security. As recently demonstrated, their cybersecurity regimen was easily penetrable — in fact, leaked emails from the DNC show members laughing at reports of how shoddy their security system really was. One official called a BuzzFeed report on national committee security “the dumbest thing I’ve ever read.”
Aaand: That the documents passed through a foreign government before ending up in Wikileaks’ hands also designates the site as a useful proxy for any foreign government looking to embarrass another. In fact:
Reading that email can’t feel good today. We’ve known this for a while, but the DNC leak is a good object lesson: Government agencies aren’t the only target of state-sponsored attacks. Any person or organization that does business with the government opens themselves up to infiltration. If nothing else, lobbyists, contractors, unions, and think tanks might want to do a security audit.
WikiLeaks kinda sucks.
No one expects WikiLeaks to protect the DNC, or the U.S., but it could at least protect individuals’ privacy. Also included in the trove of emails were “unencrypted, plain-text listings of donor emails addresses, home addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, passport numbers, and credit card information,” according to Gizmodo. WikiLeaks isn’t exactly a journalistic organization — they’re committed to radical transparency, rather than a “do no harm” guiding principle, but still: dick move.
They also sent out and then deleted this anti-Semitic tweet over the weekend.
The U.S. does this too.
I mean, this isn’t really new, but if the thought of a foreign government monitoring the emails of Washington power players and skillfully deploying them to disrupt the election process has you worried, then you should get a load of what the NSA’s been doing for the last decade and a half.
So here’s what Twitter wants you to know, by way of its new “See What’s Happening” campaign. The company is hoping a new series of ads will convince people that Twitter is a place “where you go to see what’s happening everywhere in the world right now.” (See also: a place were you go to find vicious and unbridled trolling.) As a general note, if you’re concerned people don’t understand your multibillion-dollar company, maybe you should do something about that before your ten-year anniversary.
It’s called Paper, and it’s a thesis project by Ludwig Rensch. This adorable machine even connects to your smartphone.
More interesting than Twitter’s desire to convince people to see Twitter as a news source as well as a social platform, is the company’s concern that people don’t use Twitter because they think they have to tweet on the regular. According to Twitter, people surveyed “thought if they wanted to use Twitter, they were ‘supposed to Tweet every day’ and didn’t think they would have that much to say.” The subtext there, or subtweet as it were, being that you can absolutely still use Twitter without tweeting. (Of course, Twitter is likely hoping you’ll come around the whole engaging-completely-with-the-platform thing.) And as an added bonus, if you actually never tweet, then no one will ever tweet back at you with the beloved Twitter admonishment “Never Tweet.” Which is better for all of us.
The FarmBot Genesis hopes to revolutionize DIY food production by letting a robot take care of your garden for you. At $2,900, it sure isn’t cheap, but if having knowledge of and control over how your food is grown is important to you, the price tag could easily be worth it. The company is currently trying to raise $100,000 for production costs.
A new report from Eurogamer has confirmed much of what we already know about Nintendo’s next gaming system, code name “NX.” It’ll apparently be, according to Eurogamer’s sources, a handheld console that can also dock with your TV in order to be played on a larger screen. On each side of the handheld’s screen are two controllers that can detach, as needed. In addition, the console will use physical cartridges for games. (The word “cartridges” might call to mind the N64 or Game Boy, but we’re more likely to see something along the lines of an SD card.)
This is all pretty interesting, but not particularly surprising. Nintendo’s handheld systems have been far more successful than its TV-console competitor, the Wii U, which was hobbled from the start. And this is the most important thing for Nintendo: It has to nail the messaging if it wants the NX to succeed.
Unless you’ve been following NX rumors for months, most of the specifics above sound pretty far out-there. Nintendo can’t just come out and say, “It’s a portable device but it also hooks up to your TV like a PlayStation, and oh, also, the controller detaches from the system itself.” That’s a no-go. According to Eurogamer, the company is working on explaining the system around the simple concept “of being able to take your games with you on the go.”
Simple is better in these cases. In 2012, Nintendo bungled the launch of its Wii successor, the Wii U, by underexplaining it. The system still used Wii controllers, giving consumers the impression that it was a half-step, not an entirely new console. The fact that the names were almost identical didn’t help — the logical progression from “PlayStation 2” to “PlayStation 3” is more apparent than “Wii” to “Wii U.”
Microsoft made similar messaging blunders when it unveiled the Xbox One. Early leaks revealed that the system was designed to function only when it had an internet connection, and that DRM would prevent players from selling used games to others. The company quickly did an about-face amidst the backlash, but not soon enough to shake off the stigma, which still haunts the console three years later. Its sales numbers lag behind its counterpart, the PlayStation 4.
If there’s a company equipped to make this sort of pitch, it’s Nintendo, which has a long track record of unveiling confusing and exciting consumer hardware — a 3-D headset, a Game Boy with a touchscreen, a wand that senses your movement. But first impressions set the stage, and if Nintendo whiffs that, they’ll spend years playing catch-up.
Are you bored today? Here is a fun thing you can do to pass the time and also put that printer you own (but never use) to good work. Roam your house and collect any framed photographs you have displayed. Now, replace the pictures with printed photos of actor Steve Buscemi of The Big Lebowski and Fargo (and just about everything else the Coen Brothers have ever sneezed on) fame. You will laugh. Your dog will laugh. Your dad will laugh. (Dads love The Big Lebowski.)
This excellent idea comes courtesy of the Manion family in Wisconsin. Kevin Manion pulled the stunt, which his sister, Clare, then documented and shared on Twitter as any good sibling would. She has since been retweeted 18,000 times.
Kevin, for his part, remains humble in the face of his newfound internet fame.
Someday Amazon will deliver your toilet paper or French press or blender or screen-printed body pillow to your doorstep via drone. But first, the company has to work out all the kinks of sending weighty boxes through the sky in unmanned aircraft.
Starting this week, Amazon will be testing its drone program in the skies over the United Kingdom, the company announced via press release. The goal is to engineer a system which will “safely get packages up to 5 pounds to customers in 30 minutes or less.” One of the elements Amazon will be focusing on is operating drones “beyond line of sight operations in rural and suburban areas.” This is an issue which Amazon, and anybody attempting to get into the commercial-drone game, faces in the United States, where FAA regulations require drones remain in sight at all times. (The U.K. has a similar rule, but Quartz reports that an exception appears to have been made for Amazon, provided they avoid “crowded urban areas.”)
Amazon continues to test Prime Air (which launched two years ago) drones in the United States, but it seems like the company might have more luck across the pond given this new partnership with the U.K. government. Which means if you want to have a five-pound bag of sugar-free gummy bears dropped at your feet by an Amazon drone, you might have to move. (Good luck with that whole Brexit thing!)
What is so funny about dead animals? The answer is: Nothing. And yet Harambe, the gorilla who was shot and killed in May by security personnel at the Cincinnati Zoo after a 3-year-old boy climbed into his enclosure, has become in his death an all-purpose punch line across Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook — a meme to be reckoned with.
Today, comedian Sarah Silverman joined the illustrious list of celebrities who have been hacked on Twitter. (List includes, but is not limited to, Tenacious D, Mark Zuckerberg, Kylie Jenner, Katy Perry, Keith Richards, and the guy who founded Twitter.) In a now-deleted tweet, Silverman (or rather her hacker) tweeted a link to an Anonymous video earlier this morning.
We should not still be talking about Harambe. When I say “should not,” I don’t even mean that it’s morally wrong to joke about Harambe. (Though more on that in a moment.) I mean that, as a running joke, Harambe should have had a shelf life of maybe two weeks. The meme should have died shortly after the animal did.
But it didn’t. Last week at the Republican National Convention, Harambe (the meme) was spotted in the wild:
Memes about Harambe started popping up almost immediately after news of his death hit the web, at almost the same moment as the outrage over the tragic death of the gorilla. This is unsurprising: Memes will flower in the cracks of whatever is circulating on a given social network, and mass outrage, which seizes social media for hours at a time, necessarily provides a fertile ground. What’s surprising is that the outrage over Harambe has subsided, but the memes live on.
Are Harambe memes offensive? I’m not here to judge Harambe memesters, nor to absolve them. I am merely an observer. But it seems worth saying that the running joke of Harambe-the-punch-line isn’t really predicated on its shock value. Harambe memes aren’t the topical equivalent of dead-baby jokes; they’re fairly standard internet non-sequitur nonsense humor.
Even if the story didn’t continue much past the inciting incident, it nevertheless created a framework for How We Talk About Senseless Big-Animal Death Online. When Harambe was killed, there was already an understanding of what would happen next, and how the story would play out over the next several weeks. And so Harambe’s ironic meme brigade tore out of the starting blocks like a rocket. Cecil memes happened as a response to Cecil outrage, but Harambe memes happened in anticipation of Harambe outrage. Harambe became a referendum on and a satire of social-media-outrage culture, his name a stand-in for everything wrong with the way social media reacts to news.
Cecil the Lion, as anyone who was online last year will remember, was the African lion lured out of his sanctuary and killed by the dentist Walter Palmer. The killing was a flash point for a weeks-long cycle of anger, outrage, and invective, much of it justified (Palmer had paid $50,000 for the opportunity to travel halfway around the world to kill a wild animal) and some of it, maybe, a little bit, disingenuous (the BBC reported that local Zimbabweans didn’t really care about the incident). It dominated the social web for a month, and then, more or less, disappeared.
And, of course, once Harambe became a joke, his name was launched into the nonsense stratosphere in which all big memes orbit — the place where the word Harambe itself suffices for a punch line, without needing to mean much at all. Which has led us now to the current pervasive Harambe meme: dicks out for Harambe. Here is how (I think) it works: As a tribute to the primate, you get your dick out. Here is the actor Danny Trejo doing it. I’m not sure what that accomplishes, but…
The hashtag #Hilary4Prison is particularly loaded, not just because it shows the hackers are unclear on how to spell the Democratic nominee’s name, but also given Silverman’s speech at the DNC earlier this week. A staunch and vocal advocate for Bernie Sanders during the primaries, Silverman pivoted in her speech and urged her fellow Sanders supporters to throw their weight (and votes) behind Hillary Clinton in November. (There was also a particularly great, off-the-cuff line where she said to the Bernie or Bust subset, “You’re being ridiculous.”)
As of 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday morning it appears things are back to normal and Silverman has regained control of her account. (And might want to change up her passwords or invest in a password manager.) That or this was all a giant ruse and Silverman is still secretly stanning for Bernie Sanders, which is a totally unlikely, but would make for a decent movie plot.
Still, uh, what gives? Marx tells us: “History repeats itself, the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.” And Harambe is not the first famous animal to die senselessly in the age of social media.
So what happens next? It seems worth saying here, below Danny Trejo, that maybe the biggest reason “Harambe” has managed to survive this long is that it still carries the frisson of offensiveness, even if it’s hard to actually take offense at the jokes. In other words, it’s a meme that will never be co-opted by internet-literate corporate Twitter accounts or deployed by some hapless news anchor hoping for a viral moment. The internet feels less and less like a truly separate cultural space, and fewer and fewer such internet-only in-jokes exist (tongue-in-cheek 9/11 trutherism, beloved by teens, comes to mind). It’s hard to come across cultural products online untainted by corporate advertisers or sponsors. “Harambe” is still a funny punch line because brands will never touch it.
Obviously, there are other ways to end the Harambe meme. Like writing a think piece about it.
Congratulations to everyone who participated in the Ice Bucket Challenge. You all contributed equally to this important discovery.
Today, the ALS Association, which used the challenge to raise $115 million, announced that funds have actually contributed to a major discovery. Researchers discovered the NEK1 gene, “which now ranks among the most common genes that contribute to the disease.” The University of Massachusetts had received $1 million from the campaign, and funded Project MinE, which eventually discovered NEK1.
The idea for the challenge was, if I recall correctly, you dumped a bunch of water on your head and donated money and challenged other people to do the same. And if you didn’t dump the water, you had to give more money. It was a very silly challenge that roped in dozens of major celebrities and one future Republican presidential nominee. (A personal favorite: Vin Diesel challenging Michelle Obama, Angelina Jolie, and Putin.)
In the summer of 2014, the Ice Bucket Challenge wrapped its frigid hands around social media and didn’t let go for what seemed like all of August. That was two whole years ago. Two revolutions around the sun. Americans hadn’t even been introduced to Left Shark yet.
Stars! They love their automatic hand-soap dispensers just like us! We polled a bunch of famous people on their favorite gadget and found out that Jorma Taccone loves the Boombotix that RZA gave him, and Mike Birbiglia can’t get enough of his Fitbit.
Mike Birbiglia “My Fitbit. Because it tells me how long I sleep at night. And it even tells me, like, when I’m restless. It’s incredible.”
Keegan-Michael Key“My favorite gadget right now is this wine opener — you’ve seen these things — where you pierce the wine cork with, like, a syringe that has air, and you just go like this on the top, and it pumps air into the cork, and then the cork just raises up out of the thing. It’s like a magic trick. It’s real fun.”
Gillian Jacobs“I’ve fallen in love with my Kindle recently. I was never a Kindle person, but traveling a lot, I have realized the benefit of being able to have a lot of books on one small tablet.”
Kate Micucci“I have one of those Sunbeam things that you can boil water in really really fast. If I didn’t have that thing, I don’t know that I would drink so much tea. I’ve had it since college, it’s still holding up great, and I don’t know what I would do without it. [Laughs.] Every morning, that’s how I make my tea.”
Chris Gethard “My mom gave me a gift once which was an automatic hand soap dispenser, and I keep that in my kitchen. I greatly enjoy it. I do; you stick your hand under it, and it shoots the soap on your hand, and it’s right there on my kitchen sink. Which is not a thing everyone gets in their house. It feels like a real luxury.”
MH: “Oh, I like our Nespresso milk frother that I use every morning for making myself coffee. It’s an electric one, and it makes incredible foam. And every morning I make myself a cup of coffee, and then I give my kid a little bit of milk foam in a tiny little espresso cup, and we pretend we have our coffee together.”
Zoe Kazan “We have a UE Boom, which we bring in the car. Paul [Dano]’s sister doesn’t have a stereo. It’s, like, his grandparents’ old car, and so we put that in the car. It has great sound.”
Jorma Taccone and Marielle Heller JT: “I have something that RZA from Wu-Tang Clan gave us called the Boombotix, and it’s a little hexagonal Bluetooth speaker, and I use it all the time. And it’s really durable — my kid uses it and he chucks it across the room and it, like, is unbreakable somehow. It has pretty good sound. I mean, RZA cares about sound quality, you know what I mean? I would hope he does. Seems like he did.”

Whatever else you might say about WikiLeaks, it’s hard to think of an institution that squanders goodwill more efficiently. Even the people most sympathetic to its aims and ideals have had a hard time defending it recently. Just over the last couple of weeks, whoever ran its Twitter account posted tweets that are either anti-Semitic or deeply weird (the fact that WikiLeaks founder and head Julian Assange ranted about Jewish reporters to a British journalist in 2011 certainly makes it harder to view the posts in a charitable light). Then it was revealed that some of the Democratic National Committee documents it leaked last week — timed intentionally to do maximum damage to Hillary Clinton’s presidential chances, according to Assange — contained personal information, including credit card and Social Security numbers, of DNC donors.
Shortly after the attempted coup that rocked Turkey two weeks ago — in which a small subset of the Turkish military briefly and very unsuccessfully tried to seize power from President Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP — WikiLeaks started amping up the hype for an document dump. “Waiting for our new 100k+ doc release on the leadup to the #TurkeyCoup?” tweeted WikiLeaks on July 18. “Explore our past publications on #Erdogan https://search.WikiLeaks.org/?q=erdogan.” Then, later that day, “Coming Tuesday: The #ErdoganEmails: 300 thousand internal emails from Erdoğan’s AKP - through to July 7, 2016.”
This wasn’t quite the case, however. Zeynep Tufekci, a Turkish sociologist with a focus on technology and censorship who is based at the University of North Carolina, was initially stranded in Turkey because of the coup, so, for the first day or so after the documents were posted, she didn’t have much time to look into them. But soon she noticed that her fellow Turkish and Turkey-focused activists and researchers were tweeting that the WikiLeaks emails weren’t actually from the AKP or the government at all — and, worse, they contained private citizens’ personal information.
In the past, WikiLeaks has tended to defend itself against (frequent) charges of recklessness, indiscretion, and negligence by citing an absolute commitment to free speech and transparency. But these defenses are increasingly less credible, as WikiLeaks seems unable (or unwilling) to rigorously process its leaks — or even fact-check its own claims. The recent fiasco of the “Erdogan emails” (which, as we’ll see, actually have very little to do with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in any meaningful sense) is a shocking demonstration.
As promised, the next day WikiLeaks published a page announcing the release of “part one of the AKP Emails.” “The material was obtained a week before the attempted coup,” the site explained. “However, WikiLeaks has moved forward its publication schedule in response to the government’s post-coup purges. We have verified the material and the source, who is not connected, in any way, to the elements behind the attempted coup, or to a rival political party or state.” In response, Turkey swiftly blocked access to wikileaks.org, which some took as proof that the leak’s contents were legit. “How to authenticate a leak,” tweeted Edward Snowden, linking to a Reuters article headlined “Turkey blocks access to WikiLeaks after ruling party email dump.” WikiLeaks offered the same interpretation of the government’s actions, tweeting, “Erdogan government officially orders WikiLeaks to be blocked after publishing 300k emails from his party, AKP.”
For people who don’t read Turkish, it was easy to leave it at that and take WikiLeaks’ claims at face value: The site had published a huge trove of emails from Turkey’s ruling party, and Turkey had then blocked WikiLeaks to prevent people from viewing this newly aired dirty laundry.
When she checked into what journalists in Turkey were saying about the leak on Twitter, and looked into the emails herself, she found that indeed, WikiLeaks hadn’t actually released a trove of government emails. Rather, it had released what appears to be big chunks of archives from various far-from-top-secret online discussion groups. One such Google Group, called “All Together for Turkey” (Turkiye-icin-el-ele@googlegroups.com), has 77,000 members and is dedicated to general political discussion, she said. Elsewhere in the document dumps are thousands of mentions of other, similar-sounding Google and Yahoo groups — there are many emails containing the address eTurkiyeyizBiz@googlegroups.com, for example, which Tufekci said translates roughly to “We are Turkey,” and which looks like a forum dedicated to sharing news stories. Overall, Tufekci said, she and other activists have now been poring over the archives for a week and there’s no sign anyone has found emails that weren’t taken from online discussion groups (though she was quick to add that she “can’t rule out” there are more meaningful emails buried somewhere in the huge stash).
As with the archives of any big, sprawling discussion groups, the emails contain “lots of nonsense,” Tufekci said — jokes and conspiracy theories and recipes and so on. But whatever is in there, “It’s so clearly not government emails,” she said. “As soon as you start looking, you can tell, absolutely.” Tufekci pointed out that just a tiny fraction of the emails contain an AKP address, “akparti.org.tr,” in the “From” field — she sent me a link to a search that revealed 683 such emails, a minuscule slice of the total stash of about 300,000. In some of these cases, she told me, people had simply posted to the discussion groups email responses they had gotten from AKP officials they were bugging about a job opening or whatever else. (When you put “akparti.org.tr” in both the “From” and “To” fields, the number dwindles yet further, to 275, with many of the results clearly spammy, even to a non-Turkish-speaker.) Once word of this spread among Turkish scholars and activists, some anti-censorship activists — the sorts of people who would have been excitedly lapping up a genuine link of AKP emails — began publicly expressing disgust at the document dump, which had no meaningful connection to the Erdogan or his ruling party.
After misleading people into believing it had leaked a giant cache of sensitive Turkish government emails, WikiLeaks dug itself deeper: “Here’s the full data for our Turkey AKP emails + more,” the organization tweeted on July 21, linking to a since-deleted page. That page hosted multiple databases containing Turkish citizens’ personal information. One included about 10 million rank-and-file AKP members, Tufekci said. Even more shocking, another contained what appears to be information for every female voter in 79 of Turkey’s 81 provinces — more than 20 million entries’ worth of addresses and cell-phone numbers. (Women who were AKP members appeared to have more information associated with them listed, Tufekci said.)
WikiLeaks responded to Tufekci’s criticisms in a rather WikiLeaks-ian fashion: by accusing her, among other things, of shilling for a despot.
Disturbed by all of this, Tufekci took to Huffington Post to report her findings on Monday, highlighting both the misleading nature of WikiLeaks’ “Erdogan emails” claim and the mass doxing to which it had contributed: “According to the collective searching capacity of long-term activists and journalists in Turkey, none of the ‘Erdogan emails’ appear to be emails actually from Erdogan or his inner circle,” she wrote. “Nobody seems to be able to find a smoking gun exposing people in positions of power and responsibility.” She pointed out that the mass doxing of women was particularly harmful in light of the fact that “every year in Turkey, hundreds of women are murdered, most often by current or ex-husbands or boyfriends, and thousands of women leave their homes or go into hiding, seeking safety.”
Tufekci found the claim that she was “running flak for Erdogan” particularly amusing given her reputation as an anti-censorship, pro-human-rights voice on Turkey, and that it fit what appears to be the organization’s overall aversion to fact-checking. “Apparently they can’t even Google,” she told me. “My New York Times article about censorship in Turkey is a week old.” (In that column, she writes that “Press and internet freedoms have taken an especially drastic turn” under Erdogan in recent years.) “I’m gonna print [that tweet] and put it on my wall the next time I’m in Turkey,” she said.
As bad as WikiLeaks’ mistakes were, they were only compounded by the respected outlets that uncritically echoed the organization’s claims — or, worse, unwittingly distorted the emails’ contents with context-free selections. Take this tweet from Lee Fang, an accomplished, respected investigative journalist:
Mostly, WikiLeaks’ complaints about Tufekci hinged on a technicality: In her article and her tweeting, she initially used the term “dump” to describe WikiLeaks’ actions, referring to both the emails the site hosted and the databases it linked to on its social accounts. WikiLeaks has latched onto the fact that while it hosted the (not actually) “Erdogan emails,” it merely linked to the doxing databases, providing easy access to them to millions of people. (Tufekci said her vague wording was intentional — she didn’t want to make it too easy for her followers to find the databases.) The site tweeted out “WikiLeaks did not publish the databases in question at any time. Please correct” to Tufekci and various other various people. WikiLeaks blocked Tufekci on Twitter, she said, after she started tweeting into the organization’s feed tweets from anti-censorship activists who were openly wishing the dump had never happened.
As Tufekci noted at the Huffington Post, “Even a cursory Google search of a phrase from that particular email would have revealed that it was actually a copied-and-pasted 2014 news article speculating about a Turkish businessman visiting the U.S.” I’m not singling out Fang, an acquaintance, as a particularly bad actor, either: The Christian Science Monitor fell for WikiLeaks’ claims in a particularly amusing manner.
Tufekci wrote:
This sort of thing happened over and over as the rumors swirled out across Twitter, with journalists, cranks, conspiracy theorists, and other people who don’t read Turkish holding up utterly pedestrian content from online discussion forums as proof of … something. Tufekci compared the English-language response to a hypothetical foreign group gaining access to an archive of MetaFilter threads, publishing them online, and a sleuth — non-English-speaking — then plucking out a few that contained a 9/11 truther’s pasted emails to the government and presenting them as new evidence about the attacks’ true perpetrators.
If there is a bright side, it’s only that the cache of documents provided a prompt for gallows humor on Turkish Twitter during a stressful, uncertain time: For example, one of the “leaked” emails was a recipe for the tasty Turkish treat semolina halva, so Tufekci said that “Turkish Twitter took to debating whether the recipe that WikiLeaks exposed had too much sugar.”
The weirdest, most Orwellian aspect of all this, of course, is that there are a lot of people — maybe millions, given the size of WikiLeaks’ social-media footprint — who continue to think WikiLeaks graced the world with a trove of documents connected to Erdogan and his AKP inner circle. This belief has been reinforced by endlessly overhyped and undercooked reporting and social-media activity, with the net result being that WikiLeaks has been able to present itself — as always — as a brave force for transparency and democracy. It appears that hardly any of the people who think WikiLeaks has exposed malfeasance on the part of the Turkish government know that what it has actually exposed is millions of Turkish people’s private information, for no reason it has yet been willing to explain. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, WikiLeaks has not deigned to clarify the actual contents of the “Erdogan emails,” nor explain the pro-democratic, anti-authoritarian benefits of helping to dox tens of millions of people. But at least the site’s fans have access to a new dessert recipe.
Ultimately, Tufekci said, WikiLeaks’ apparent recklessness won’t just impact the individuals who have been doxed. The leaks could also directly benefit Turkey’s pro-censorship forces in their long-term goal to gain a tighter control over the information flow in and into the country. Especially relative to other Western, developed countries, Turkey has an abysmal reputation and record when it comes to press freedom and censorship, and in this case the censors can point to WikiLeaks and its philosophy of radical, heedless transparency doing very real harm to Turks — and it’s hard for the Zeynep Tufekcis of the world to argue with them.
WikiLeaks didn’t respond to a Twitter request for comment, and an email to the organization’s press address bounced back with a “delayed delivery” note (I’ll update this story if WikiLeaks does eventually comment). It’s impossible not to wonder what the hell happened here: WikiLeaks clearly thought it had on its hands a giant trove of AKP emails. Who told them that? Why? And what was the thinking behind spreading the links to the doxing documents? Did WikiLeaks even know what it was linking to and have a sense of why it was doing so? Whatever the motives of the people who leaked all of this material to WikiLeaks, this is a striking example of what can happen when a powerful and unaccountable organization operates with impulsivity and little due diligence.
Last week Milo Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter for harassing Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones, which may have made him more popular than ever — especially at the RNC.
Remember Legos? The fun, square toys of your childhood that made your parents scream like a Home Alone bandit if they stepped on one bare foot? Remember the cute human minifigures with their weird cylindrical heads and fingerless hands that came with them? Great. We’re here to ruin that memory for you.
Well, actually, former Mythbuster Adam Savage is here to ruin it for you. Savage’s site Tested teamed up with a pro makeup artist at San Diego Comic-Con to create the cosplay nobody asked for: a human Lego minifig. The resulting costume, complete with fake skin, a slot mouth, smushed ears, and hands with just one giant fingernail each, is gross and uncanny, and yet I can’t stop watching this video.
In a truly heinous act that has me wishing the writers of 2016 would hurry up and get to the season finale already, a 19-year-old man, Demetrious Kelly, was arrested in Brooklyn earlier this month for beating another man on the street with a selfie stick.
After engaging in an argument with his 27-year-old victim, Kelly “hit the victim on the arms and back, causing cuts to his hands and back, bruising on his back and substantial pain,” DNAInfo reports. Kelly was arrested for harassment, assault, menacing, and criminal possession of a weapon. Again, all this over a selfie stick. A selfie stick!
As the cause for the argument between the two men is currently unknown, we can only speculate what caused Kelly to snap and wield his stick as a weapon: global warming, Donald Trump, the fact that bees are dying globally at an alarming rate? The world may never know.
Now you can track and locate Pokémon near you whenever you want. You just drop a pin and see what Pokémon are nearby. You’ll also see how long they’ll be there. So basically, this website lets you hack the core functionality of the game which is, of course, hunting for Pokémon. You didn’t need exercise anyway. Relax.
Last night, Radiohead kicked off its U.S. concert tour with one of two performances at Madison Square Garden in New York City. In attendance was one anonymous man whose friend bailed on him at the last minute, leaving him with an extra ticket. Not wanting the ticket to go to waste, he did what any normal person would do: He posted an ad on Craigslist.
Yesterday was not a great day for tech giants’ quarterly reports. Apple reported that hardware sales were soft, but services were up, and Twitter reported that it is still a very dicey proposition. Don’t worry for the industry, though — here comes Mark Zuckerberg, dragging a bag of cash behind him.
Facebook released its second-quarter earnings report and, uh, well, the takeaway is that Facebook is a very good business to be in. Its user numbers have hit the billion mark, with daily active users up 17 percent to 1.13 billion, and mobile daily users at 1.03 billion. Monthly, the company has 1.7 billion active users. More than one billion people are also using the separate Messenger app on a monthly basis. My sophisticated tech analysis: That is so many users, geez louise.
Facebook made, to put this delicately, a fuckload of money, with a year-over-year increase that is alarming. In the second quarter of 2016, Facebook brought in more than $6.4 billion in revenue, up more than 59 percent from the same quarter last year, in which it earned $4 billion. It was estimated that the company would bring in only $6 billion this quarter. My tech analysis: I have used the word “billion” multiple times in this post but have not yet used the word “million” until just now.
Facebook has beaten expectations in 16 out of 17 quarters since it went public in 2012, and it doesn’t really show any signs of stopping. As we’ve written about many, many times, Facebook basically controls the internet. And it will continue to do so for many years, because it is a software company that can switch focus to new initiatives quickly, unlike Apple, which has to plan out its hardware moves years in advance. Currently, that focus is live video, which Zuckerberg briefly paid lip service to on the earnings call.
My tech analysis: Facebook will never die and will, probably, soon start harvesting humans for fuel.
Zuckerberg, the company’s CEO, also noted on the earnings call that Instagram’s algorithmic feed has increased user engagement, so haters can shove it. (He did not actually say “haters can shove it,” but you could sense that he wanted to.)
If you’ve been on the internet at all this week, you’ve no doubt been barraged by DNC takes, earnings call breakdowns, and perhaps, if you were so lucky, this postmortem on Harambe memes. All of these are fine, but they pale in comparison to this video of a tiny human absolutely losing his mind in a music class, which is clearly the best thing to surface online this week. (It’s been a slow couple of days here on the World Wide Web.)
The video, which is currently moving up the /r/videos subreddit, currently has only 600 views on YouTube. (But the view counter must be stuck, because I have watched it at least 700 times myself.) The premise is simple: Every time their teacher stops playing the guitar and singing, the kids are supposed to stop clapping. And every time that happens, the kid in the blue shirt with the smile of a small, innocent human who still sees only good in the word cackles with laughter.
Thank you, kid, for this pure and good gift on an otherwise humdrum Wednesday. (Also, shout-out to whoever filmed this scene and put it on the internet.)
In the ad, the man explained that the ticket itself would cost $100. Okay. It was a fair-enough price considering tickets sold out within minutes of going on sale back in March. (Damn you, bots!) But there was also a catch: If you wanted the ticket, you also had to be willing to send a “booty photo” with “something that reads RADIOHEAD above it (or on the tush itself).”
The ad is currently still live on Craigslist, so it’s unclear if anybody actually exchanged a crisp Benjamin Franklin and an image of a toned rear for the ticket in the end. (Or if there ever was a Radiohead ticket to be purchased at all and this wasn’t just some elaborate ruse using Thom Yorke’s name in the pursuit of lewd pics.) If you did buy this ticket, please feel free to drop Select All a line and tell us all about it. (Though we’ll pass on the picture of your ass, thank you very much.)
This Halloween, Black Mirror — the anthology series that asks, “What if the tech we think is good … is actually bad?” — returns for a third season on Netflix. Netflix has released an episode list without synopses — but I, as a sophisticated technology expert, have my guesses.
“San Junipero”On the remote island of San Junipero, society lives apart from the rest of the world and has never used computer technology. When a mysterious shipwreck survivor washes ashore, she introduces the island natives to her only remaining possession: an iPod Classic whose only contents are the soundtrack to Shrek 2 and a ton of vaporwave.
“Nosedive”A former Olympic diver and current start-up executive discovers an eerie correlation: Whenever she does a high dive, her company’s stock takes a nosedive. Will she be able to give up the pastime she loves for the company that offers a really good cafeteria and free dry cleaning done on premises?
“Shut Up and Dance”Two men from the year 2016 mysteriously wake up and realize that they’ve traveled back in time … to the year 2013, when the Harlem Shake meme has taken the nation by storm. Everywhere they go, they are forced by Obama’s Meme Police to participate in another Harlem Shake video. Can the duo break the cycle and return home?
“Men Against Fire”Thousands of women die in fires every year, but men rarely speak out on the issue. That all changes when a viral Facebook comment causes roving hordes of men to get “woke.” The men team up to form “Men Against Fire” … but has p.c. culture gone too far?
“Playtest”If you die in the game, you die in real life.
“Hated in the Nation”After Sustine Jacco’s tweet is taken out of context, she becomes the most hated person in America. The country eggs her house and calls on her to be fired. They’re out for blood. All hope seems lost until author Ron Jonson attempts to rehabilitate her image using his advanced “actually” skills.
At the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last night, Vice-President Joe Biden took the stage to praise nominee Hillary Clinton. Biden is a charismatic, unpretentious speaker, and the stadium hung on his words as he built to a roaring condemnation of Clinton’s opponent, Donald Trump. It was a fine, memorable performance.
The Onion’s serial portrait of Joe Biden as a horny, hard-partying, copper-wire-scavenging scammer known as “Diamond” Joe Biden (Headline: “Biden Chokes Up While Describing Hardworking Americans Who Can Only Afford Shitty Ditch Weed”) has probably done almost as much as the real Biden’s actual folksiness to endear him to Democrats over the last eight years, and while Biden-joke pedants might point out that the butt-rock-loving Biden of the Onion would probably not be a Wu-Tang Clan fan, BlippoBlappo’s Liquid Swords nevertheless carries with it the same myth-making potency: an image that it feels more true than the actual truth. The tweet itself has hung around Twitter for the last couple of years, retweeted nearly any time the vice-president is in the news, and so when Biden took the stage on Wednesday night, Twitter hoped that he might pay tribute:
Since Biden took over the job from real-life Oswald Cobblepot Dick Cheney, there’s been an impulse to return the vice-presidency to a less active, and therefore less scary, position — a cushy, do-nothing job from which absolutely no wars would be planned. The president does the work, and the vice-president gets to stand near him when he takes the credit. Obama is the straight man; Biden the charming rogue. What else is Biden going to do all day? Not listen to Liquid Swords?
But Joe Biden can’t be vice-president forever. The Democrats have a new nominee in the form of Tim Kaine, who, well, doesn’t really seem like a Whitesnake fan. If Hillary Clinton, as the president, is still the straight man of the comedy duo Twitter has come to write into the White House, what is Kaine’s shtick?
This is the Tim Kaine joke now. He loves the cool indie dad-rock bands. He could be the nation’s cool dad if you vote for him in November. The only problem: Would a grinning, slightly dorky, cool dad grab a podium at all?
But there were two words that, in his final major speech as second-in-command, Biden did not say. Two words that have so thoroughly engrained themselves in the character of “Joe Biden” that it is nearly impossible to see him stand at the podium and not think, “God, I hope he says the words.”
Those words are “Liquid Swords.”
On the one hand, he’s a fan of legendary alt-rock band the Replacements. On the other, he’s an older white man in a suit — which means quote-unquote dad vibes. (To be fair, he does carry four harmonicas with him.) And so Tim Kaine is now the podium-grabber, but his tastes skew a little more eclectic.
Last night amidst the cheering and the booing and the speeches and the general revelry at the DNC, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton shared an intimate moment on stage. The pair embraced following Obama’s speech as “Signed, Sealed, Delivered” played in the background. It was a lovely moment. Just look at the joy on their little Democrat faces.
Of course, the internet being the internet it couldn’t just leave the image of the current president and potential future president hugging well enough alone. Instead, Redditors descended on the photo, using it as a subject for a Photoshop battle. (Users edit an image and vote on which is best, until a winner is declared or the pictures get so weird and uncomfortable people just give up.)
Some of the better edits are more subtle, like this high-school prom scene.
Or this handsy Obama.
Tumblr users went nuts for ‘he cookin.’ It’s not a huge meme, but it is a very good one.
Okay, let’s just get right down to it: There is a new meme on the net and it is insanely good. The meme is “He cookin.”
The point is: he cookin. It’s that simple. He cookin!
While others were, um, let’s just say, not subtle.
Who is “he”? Why is he “cookin”? “He cookin” is a small, blurry GIF (dating back to at least 2012) of a cat standing on two legs. He is moving his front paws around in a way that appears to mimic the cooking dance popularized by rapper, meme, and basketball-hexer Lil B, the Based God. He started cookin on Tumblr when user relishman was asked to name his top 5 dance moves. Number one was “he cookin.”
This one gets slightly weird when you notice the hand wrapped around littler Hillary is still Barack Obama’s.
And in the end, Redditors came to the only logical conclusion for the photo.
God bless this fine feline. Keep on cookin, he.
If there is one thing that can bring people together for a little bit of nonpartisan joy, it’s a good livestream. First, there were bald eagles. And then, bears catching salmon. And now, the Amorphophallus titanum, better known as the corpse flower for its pleasant, rotting-flesh odor.
If you’ve got issues waking up, falling sleep, or snoring (and, let’s be honest, who among us doesn’t fall into at least one of these categories?), a “smart” pillow could be for you. This one is called the Zeeq Smart Pillow, and it’s got some pretty interesting features.
The flower is currently on display at the New York Botanical Garden, where it officially began its bloom cycle today. Corpse flowers famously (I mean, the plants did get a shout-out in the new Gilmore Girls trailer, so I’d call them famous) take up to a decade to bloom and fill the air with their putrid skin smell, so this is A Thing.
The blooming period will only last a few days before the flower collapses and we have to wait another ten years, so tune in while the stench of dead humans wasting away is still fresh. Not that you’ll be able to smell it through your screen anyway, but still.
The only halfway-interesting rumor about the next iPhone is that it won’t have a regular headphone jack. Aaand, right on cue, a new video leak appears to confirm it. In the video, a man, speaking Vietnamese, shows off what looks to be the Lightning-to-3.5 mm adapter that is rumored to come bundled with every iPhone. The adapter was acquired from a Foxconn assembly plant in Vietnam, according to 9to5Mac.
I realize that in four months, everyone will be over this, but for now: This sucks. Bluetooth headphones have lower sound quality and are another thing you have to remember to charge. And that adapter looks like the most breakable, loseable piece of hardware Apple has ever produced. On the flip side, that’s good for Apple, because then they can charge you $20 for a new one (I’m guessing about that price, but, to reiterate, this is Apple we’re talking about).
Perhaps the best argument for the part’s legitimacy comes toward the end of the video. The man demonstrates that the adapter is unsupported on iOS 9 (an alert pops up), but works without a hitch on beta versions of iOS 10, which will come preinstalled on new models.
Also, I would like to be able to listen to music and charge my phone at the same time!
The 3.5 mm headphone jack has been the last major design problem standing in the way of engineers making the phone as slim as possible. Without the jack, you’ll have to use wireless Bluetooth headphones or use regular, corded headphones with the adapter part.
Now, the lobster is dead. And there are many unanswered questions.
The group raised money to send Larry up the coast to the West Boothbay Harbor aquarium, but the voyage — supposed to take a day — took about a week. Larry died en route, though exactly who is to blame is up in the air. Is it the shipping company, or is it the rescue group that inadequately prepped Larry for his final journey? (Larry was originally supposed to travel via FedEx, but apparently his storage container leaked and the shippers refused.)
According to the Washington Post, Larry was first purchased by the Tin Fish restaurant in Florida. Thought to be more than 100 years old, Larry caught the attention of the local iRescue animal-rights group (always a good sign: when your animal-rights group sounds like an unauthorized iPhone repair service). Experts later guessed Larry’s age to be between 60 and 80 years. Regardless: old!
It was supposed to be the Great Escape. Animal-rights activists in Florida sought to prevent a 15-pound lobster from getting eaten by shipping it to an aquarium in Maine, where the creature, Larry, would live out his golden years in peace and tranquility.
Larry is not the first animal to die this year as a symptom of aggressive rescue efforts. Earlier this year, a baby bison in Yellowstone died after casual observers thought it looked cold.
“You need to really surround it in gel packs. This container really only had three,” Jeff Nichols, a spokesman for the Department of Marine Resources, told the Portland Press Herald.
Rest in peace, Larry. You were a large lobster and now you’re dead.
This is an example of cymatics, or the study of wave phenomena, and how it’s represented visually. Not only is it fascinating, but it’s really, really fun to watch. Isn’t it time music got more interesting? Entertain us, table salt.
Navigating the Instagram comments on popular accounts can be, for lack of a better term, a hassle. Thousands of comments roll in at once, some complimentary, some abusive, some straight-up nonsense. As has now become custom in some instances, celebrity targets are flooded with emoji, as was the case when Kanye fought with Wiz Khalifa, or Rachel Roy hinted that she was “Becky,” or when Kim Kardashian burned Taylor Swift last week.
Today, the Washington Post reports that Instagram is planning to introduce tools that allow users to moderate comments themselves, filtering what appears in the cacophony of text and emoji underneath their photos. “We have slowly begun to offer accounts with high volume comment threads the option to moderate their comment experience. As we learn, we look forward to improving the comment experience for our broader community,” the network’s head of public policy told the Post.
One of the first big hints that Instagram was checking out moderation tools came during the Taylor Swift insta-raid last week when it appeared that comments with more than 26 snake emoji were being mysteriously disappeared. Instagram would not confirm to the Post that the vanishing snakes and the new mod tools were related.
The filtering feature will be available to all users in the coming weeks. The service will also let users turn off comments on individual posts.
Instagram’s announcement comes in the midst of a broader ongoing conversation about online harassment, particularly around default-public services like Twitter. Just last week, comedian Leslie Jones was harassed off the service for a couple of days after dealing with overwhelming racist vitriol. That Instagram is working on the problem while Twitter remains frustratingly vague about possible solutions is a bit embarrassing.
The deal, which is still pending based on government approval, has been gaining steam over the last few months. Some of Uber’s most prominent investors were pressuring the company to stop burning through so much money in China. Now Uber gets a cut of the market with significantly less expenditure.
As the New York Times points out, Uber’s push into China has been closely watched by the rest of the tech industry. It could arguably have been framed as a trial run for how other tech businesses might break into a populous market that often blocks foreign companies. Instead, Uber — infamous for using its vast cash reserves to spend its way through regulatory red tape — is another cautionary tale.
In an impending blog post announcing the deal, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick says, “As an entrepreneur, I’ve learned that being successful is about listening to your head as well as following your heart. Uber and Didi Chuxing are investing billions of dollars in China and both have yet to turn a profit there.”
“This agreement with Uber will set the mobile transportation industry on a healthier, more sustainable path of growth at a higher level,” Cheng said in a statement. Over the past few years, Uber has been spending more than $1 billion a year in the country trying to take control of the market. Early this year, Didi fortified its own position by accepting a $1 billion investment from Apple.
After a billion-dollar war over the Chinese taxi market, Uber is selling its operation in China to its chief rival, the Chinese ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, in exchange for a 20 percent stake, Bloomberg reports. Didi CEO Cheng Wei and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick will also be joining each other’s boards.
Despite what children’s television programming (looking at you here Bear in the Big Blue House and Paddington Bear and the family Berenstain at large) would have you believe, bears do not belong in houses. Bears do not belong anywhere near humans. Bears are, well, bears. And they are terrifying.
A California man named Rodney Ginn experienced this firsthand over the weekend when he says a bear and two cubs broke into his house. Ginn caught the intrusion on camera (hmmmm) and posted it to Facebook where it has since been viewed over 20,000 times. (A freebooted version is also at the top of Reddit this morning.) “Well that was an interesting night here’s momma bear charging me before slamming the door it was her and her 2 cubs,” Ginn captioned the video.
In the comments, Ginn explains that the bears finally made their way out after figuring out how to open a sliding door in his house. He also posted another picture of the bear and one of the cubs on the stairs, which is, you guessed it, still terrifying. Come for the minute and a half of a scared man screaming profanities, stay for the two-second glimpse of an actual bear barreling up the stairs.
Phone chargers, on the whole, are pretty utilitarian. It doesn’t take anything fancy to plug in your phone and re-juice your battery. If you are really feeling snazzy, there are wireless chargers you can use, but those involve a power base and some sort of attachment or case you have to put on your phone just for charging. Which doesn’t seem like a good enough reason, when you could just, you know, plug in your device like everybody else.
However, a new Kickstarter for a levitating wireless charger called OvRcharge might make me change my mind. In addition to charging your phone wirelessly, the accompanying magnetic case is designed to make your phone float in midair as it charges. Which is a fun party trick and would also look cool on my dresser.
The charger still has a little more than two weeks left on Kickstarter, where it needs to raise another $10,000. While the effect is cool, the devices aren’t cheap. One OvRcharge case and charging station will run you $199. For that price, you could buy about 33 Apple-certified lightning cables on Amazon. But can you really put a price on novelty?
Smartphones are great: Never has so much human interaction been avoided by so many by such small screens. Mobile carriers, though? Historically, mobile carriers have been terrible.
It’s also a sales model that works out well for carriers. A shocking number of Verizon and AT&T customers pay overage fees on a regular basis — 28 percent of AT&T’s customers and 20 percent of Verizon customers got hit at some point in 2015, per research firm Cowen & Co. T-Mobile customers simply get their data throttled when they hit their limit, avoiding overage fees but making the end of every month a fun trip back to what dial-up internet was like. Sprint markets an unlimited data plan — it’s just that under its base plan, only the first gigabyte of data is actually LTE high-speed. Everything that comes after that is at 2G speeds, which is just fast enough for you to put down your phone, go down to the corner store for a bag of Taki’s, come back, and have the rest of this article fully loaded.
The list of ways that telcos have screwed over customers is long and exhausting. But its largest segment is devoted to data plans — the arena where mobile carriers really hose customers. Nearly every carrier offers a different type of data plan, and while it may be ungenerous to say all carriers’ data plans are designed to confuse the hell out of you, all carriers’ data plans are designed to confuse the hell out of you. And chances are, you use your phone far more often for its data connection to Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and Snapchat than talking or shooting off text messages.
It’s not entirely mobile carriers’ fault there’s so much confusion about data and data charges. When we worried about running out of voice minutes and going over 200 texts per month, we had discrete units to work with. A minute is a minute; a text is a text. But what, exactly, is an Instagram upload? A Snapchat video? A Twitter post? Can one even quantify the data cost of sending or receiving a dick pic?
Which is all a long way of saying I’m now even less fun at parties, because I’m cornering people to evangelize about Project Fi from Google.
Started as an invite-only service in 2015, before being offered to the general public in early 2016, Project Fi’s network switches on the fly between T-Mobile, Sprint, and U.S. Cellular’s cell and data networks. It starts at $20 a month for unlimited talk and text, and then costs $10 per gigabyte (or essentially a penny a megabyte) after that. You set up a data plan for how much you think you’ll use in a month (I currently have 3 GB, though I’ve never come close to hitting it), and at the of the month, Project Fi refunds back whatever you didn’t use back. Or, if you exceeded your data plan, Project Fi charges a penny per MB over the limit. Go over by 321 MB in a month? That’s an extra $3.21, no overage charge in sight. At the end of the month, you get a pleasant, entirely comprehensible bill. Here’s mine from June:
Besides having a phone bill that hovers around $40 a month now, there’s a couple extra bonuses. You can keep your phone number, and if you’ve been on iOS up until now, it’s relatively easy to transfer over all your contacts. Project Fi is good for international travel — data remains priced at the same level, and international calling rates are competitive and low-priced. And customer service is 24/7 and has you chatting with an actual person within a few minutes. (When I called AT&T to make the switch to Google Fi, I spent over an hour bouncing from customer rep to customer rep before I could finally move my phone number over.)
So here’s the downside, and maybe the reason Fi will become the Google Reader of cell-phone plans (dearly remembered, never replaced). You can currently only have Fi on a Nexus 5X ($199 for 16 GB, $249 for 32 GB) and the Nexus 6P ($399 for 32 GB up to $599 for 128 GB). No iPhones, no Samsung, no Moto X Pure — pick your flavor of Nexus and move along.
But the reason I get so weirdly passionate about Project Fi isn’t the phones they offer. It’s that Fi has fully embraced that cell-phone data is now a commodity, the same as the gas for your car. But we’ve been living in a world in which you bought your car and your gas from the same company, and as a fun bonus, your car did not come with a fuel gauge. While nearly every other carrier is using that to run up the numbers in their favor, Project Fi puts a gauge on my phone, showing how much data I’ve used at any given point during the month.
You can, to a degree, track your data usage on most phones and most carriers, but it’s not easy. The carrier always knows how much data you are sucking down; you rarely do. It’s a sales model dependent on uninformed customers.
It means I am suddenly aware of what it costs to do anything on my phone when I’m not on Wi-Fi. I now know if I forget to download the new episode of The Bodega Boys podcast over Wi-Fi before I head out the door, it’ll cost me about $.87 in data to stream it. If I’m riding the Q train and I really, really have to watch a YouTube video a friend sent my way, I gotta be okay with paying the $1.34 it’ll cost me. I’m slightly stingier with my cell-phone data while out in the city which, all things considered, is not that bad a thing. It’s not like I need more time in my life looking into a glowing rectangle.
A lack of transparency in how everything was priced is what led to the clusterfuck of two-year locked-in contracts and subsidized $199 phones you didn’t get to keep, until T-Mobile essentially pushed their way into the space, severing the connection between buying a phone and buying cell-phone service. It was an offering so compelling that every other carrier was forced to follow suit.
The transparency of efforts like Project Fi and others (Republic Wireless offers a plan very similar and with slightly more choice in cell phones you can use) could do the same thing for data plans. For years, consumers thought they were getting a free lunch with unlimited data, but just like that $199 iPhone you got with a two-year contract, you probably were buying more than you needed without ever really seeing what you got. With Project Fi, I get a rational, easy-to-understand data plan — and the hope that other carriers will soon have to play catch-up.
And the Nexus 5X is, uh, look, it’s fine. I’ve been using a Nexus 5X as my daily phone for about four months now, and it does everything fine. The back is plastic, and can get a little scratched up. Its 12-megapixel camera can take good pictures and can do slow-motion video, but nobody is gonna be blowing up your shots and putting them on the subway ads soon. The external speakers aren’t great. The fingerprint scanner in the back of the phone is nicely-thought-out, but it can be finicky, especially when it’s humid. But it runs everything I need and want just fine without slowdown — even some more demanding 3-D games. Its battery lasts all day without a struggle. Thanks to its USB-C charger, I can recharge the phone from empty to full in about 45 minutes. It fits in my hand nicely, making for easy one-handed subway reading. It comes pleasantly free of bloatware. But it’s not a phone you show off (though, really, if you are showing off your phone your problems run much deeper than how many megapixels your camera sports).
From the few minutes I’ve spent with a Nexus 6P, and the numerous orgiastic reviews I’ve read, it seems like a very nice phone. It’s got that heft and aluminum body that effectively communicates “this is expensive,” while still coming in a few hundred dollars cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy 7 or iPhone 6s. Its camera is currently about as high-end as you can get, and comes loaded with a hefty amount of RAM, a fast processor, and a ridiculously huge battery that’ll get you through a full 24 hours, even with a large and bright screen up and running constantly.
Here is a pile of logs, and a cat. That is all: logs, in piles, and, hidden somewhere amidst them, a cat. Can you find it? There’s a prize waiting for you.
A well-known but often unacknowledged fact of modern life is that the streaming-video market is propped up by garbage. According to the Netflix tracking website Allflicks.net, there are currently 5,239 titles available to American subscribers, but I’d challenge you to name a dozen. Once you get past the first hundred or so titles, the catalogue becomes uncharted territory, audio-visual chum ignored by the pop-culture Establishment. The fact of the matter is that Netflix doesn’t need to have a great catalogue, because it knows that convenience outweighs quality here. You could purchase a rental at higher relative cost, or more likely, you will find yourself bored on a Friday night, settling for whatever their algorithm suggests.
Leo the Lion is famous on Tumblr, of all places, because that is where ironic fandom of cartoons meant for babies lives and grows like a benign tumor at the core of the World Wide Web. Currently floating around the network is a large collection of bullet points about how terrible this absurd bootleg of The Lion King truly is.
One of the most crucial components of Netflix is its sprawling collection of crappy kids’ movies. Kids do not care about quality: They will watch anything that is bright and has CGI animals. And that is how I found myself watching an abominable feature called Leo the Lion last Friday.
Graphically, the film is a nightmare. In video games, there is a glitch called “texture pop-in,” where the texture graphics on models look blurry and muddy until the full graphic loads in. Leo the Lion looks like a video game whose textures never load correctly.
Briefly: A lion named Leo, who is a vegetarian, has to escort two child elephants, a leopard, and a monkey to a magical lake somewhere in the jungle. This is referred to in the audio as “the heart of the jungle.” In the subtitles, it is known as the “Lake of Milk.”
The craziest part about Leo the Lion is that, thanks to a technical snafu (or possibly a by-product of Netflix’s automated system), it is actually two movies. Tumblr users noticed that the subtitles for the film do not line up at all with what happens in the film. Broadly, the arcs are similar but character names, terminology, and jokes are completely different.
In the subtitles, Leo’s vegetarianism is not referenced at all until the very end of the film, and his full name is Leo Bonecruncher.
Here are some other baffling bullet points from user kittensinsocks24:
The prize is: a very cute picture of a sleeping cat.
Along the way, they are hunted by a Mufasa-like evil elephant named Zanco, scheming to take over the herd, as well as some hyenas ripped off from The Lion King complete with bad Cheech Marin impersonations.
It is a bizarre film. A scan of the credits reveals that it was produced in Italy in 2013, which goes most of the way to explaining how the film ended up in its current state. Its subtitles appear to be a more literal translation of the film, its spoken audio track a localization. That would certainly explain other confusing elements, such as a misguided “joke” in which a mother zebra is tricked into breast-feeding the children of the group.
Oh, also, at the end of the film, after rescuing the baby elephants, Leo marries their mother and they have elephant/lion hybrid children. A majority of notes I took while watching the film end with three or four question marks (“hamlet-quoting chameleon????” is apparently not a fever dream I had).
So Leo the Lion is crap. But that’s okay! Because, it doesn’t have to be more than crap. The difference between the cost of licensing a movie like Leo the Lion and the potential gains for Netflix is a very wide chasm. I bet that a bunch of parents, after working their way through all of the halfway decent CGI-animal movies, had this Lion King rip-off appear in their recommendations and said “Sure.”
And that is how, in 2016, I ended up watching a film about jungle creatures frolicking in a pool full of milk (where did the milk come from? Nobody knows). What Leo effectively demonstrates — besides the fact that hell is real and God is dead, if xe ever even existed in the first place — is that the streaming-video websites are powered by bored children with undiscerning taste and a lot of free time. Netflix lures you in with big-name titles every month, but it keeps you around with D-grade trash.
Log cat, first spotted on Reddit by Mashable, joins the ever-growing pantheon of things the internet demanded we search for, which includes, but is not limited to: an iPhone on a rug, that dumb panda bear, and a cigar shoved in a brick wall.
(Hint: Try the middle stack.)
Nick Denton, the CEO of Gawker Media, announced on Monday that he will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in order to prevent Hulk Hogan from seizing his assets.
If historical precedent is anything to go by, the judgment will likely be reversed on appeal. Until then, however, Hogan is free to collect, which is why all of the defendants filed for Chapter 11. Three different courts denied Gawker and Denton’s attempt to stay the judgment until an appeals court addresses the case. If Denton needs money, he could always try to sell his blood to Thiel. He might be a little old, though.
Hogan was awarded $140 million by a Florida jury in March after he sued Gawker, Denton, and writer A.J. Daulerio over footage of a sex tape featuring the pro wrestler. Tech billionaire Peter Thiel — a man with deep pockets and a separate grudge against the online tabloid — financed Hogan’s litigation.
Gawker itself filed for Chapter 11 in June, and its assets will be auctioned off later this month. Daulerio will similarly file for personal bankruptcy. Denton posted briefly about the matter on Twitter this afternoon.
Salesforce knows a little something about creating an atmosphere. The software giant has installed a 106-feet-long, 7 million pixel LED display to greet visitors who walk into its headquarters. Its screen has shown everything from tropical rain forests to life-size Pac-Man games. Why should you care? Because it’s a beautiful site to behold, all this technology in one place.
Swimming can be a great source of physical therapy for the elderly and people with disabilities, but getting in the pool in a safe and dignified way is a unique challenge. Luckily, technology has come to the rescue with a useful device from a company called Poolpod Products.
Governor Anthony Cuomo, never afraid to take quick and decisive action on the issues facing New York, announced today that all 3,000 of New York’s sex offenders will be prohibited from “downloading, accessing, or otherwise engaging in any internet-enabled gaming activities, including Pokémon Go.”
Two New York state senators, Jeffrey Klein and Diane Savino, had staff members travel to 100 registered sex offenders’ addresses in NYC to see if any Pokémon, Pokéstops, or gyms turned up. Sure enough, 73 percent of the time, the area was positive for some sort of Pokémon Go activity. (The fact that nearly anywhere in NYC is gonna have some Pokémon Go–related stuff nearby was not mentioned.) The story was quickly picked up by the New York Daily News, the New York Post, and the New York Times. And so, three days later, Governor Cuomo issues his directive.
Meanwhile, left sitting on Cuomo’s desk at the end of this year’s legislative session was a bill that would have lengthened the statute of limitations on sexual-abuse cases by five years, given officials a six-month window to revisit old cases, and eliminated the difference in how public and private organizations (i.e., the Catholic Church) would be treated when it comes to child-sexual-abuse cases.
To that end, Cuomo will have the Division of Criminal Justice Services provide a current list of sexual offenders to Niantic Inc., the creator of Pokémon Go, as well providing the same list to Apple and Google. Parole officers will also be trained in how to check and see whether their parolees have been playing any internet-enabled games.
“Protecting New York’s children is priority number one and, as technology evolves, we must ensure these advances don’t become new avenues for dangerous predators to prey on new victims,” said Cuomo in a statement. “These actions will provide safeguards for the players of these augmented reality games and help take one more tool away from those seeking to do harm to our children.”
There’s a cottage industry in scare stories about Pokémon Go at this point, from robberies at gunpoint to players falling off a cliff to teens discovering a dead body while playing. And it’s true that the game does offer a way to entice players to go to certain locations by setting “lures,” and the thought that a sexual predator could use Pokémon Go to lure children is awful. But there have been no actual reports of this happening. And, at least from the vague language used in Cuomo’s post, not only would sex offenders be banned from playing Pokémon Go, but they would be banned from playing everything from Clash of Clans to Hearthstone to Minecraft. More to the point, the tragic fact is that the majority of child sexual abuse is committed by adult friends, relatives, or authority figures — it’s estimated that anywhere from 60 to 90 percent of victims know their abuser. The idea of a stranger using an insanely popular app to carry out a heinous act gets headlines, but preventing 3,000 people from downloading Pokémon Go will be difficult to enforce and offers very little protection to children actually in danger.
It’s no secret the Rio Olympics are contentious. There’s Zika. There’s the fact that athletes will be swimming and paddling through water riddled with human feces. Construction is way behind schedule and, of course, there’s that whole national-security thing to consider. But all of these pale in comparison to the biggest problem the games face: You can’t play Pokémon Go in Brazil.
This rig can supposedly transform into a stand-in for any type of car. If it’s as good as it looks, it could save both advertisers and filmmakers a lot of money. As for us consumers, it’s just more fiction on TV. What are we supposed to believe, television?
Last week, athletes began moving into the Olympic Village in Rio (which has been described charmingly as “uninhabitable“). Upon arrival, several athletes opened up the app to discover that the game does not work in Brazil. (Hey guys, not that I’m here to judge, but you’re at the OLYMPICS! Maybe save the video games for September.)
In a brief press release yesterday, Apple announced a number of redesigns to its set of emoji, including options that depict female athletes and professionals. Perhaps most controversial (but not really) is the fact that the gun emoji, which currently looks like a pistol, will be changed to resemble a plastic squirt gun. Suddenly, the name you gave your ex in your address book is fun and playful!
In Stadil’s defense, it seemed like his heart might have been in the right place. “My goal wasn’t to fuck around, I was here to find that special someone.” Then again, maybe not. “I once asked a girl who had spent the entire first date telling me a very sad story about her being an orphan. On our second date, I asked her how her parents were doing.”
Recording a conversation for future playback can be vital for you or, say, your husband’s reputation. But most built-in microphones on handsets are not great. The HTC One M9, while not a standout in most other areas, got high marks for its microphone quality, with a noise-canceling microphone built in to help reduce external sound. Record another call being made on a speakerphone with no worries with the HTC One M9.
Just ignore the extremely low Amazon rating.
After his iPhone was stolen on a vacation in Italy, Joonas Kiminki immediately set about trying to get it back. When he called the number, he found the phone was shut off. For security, he had set up the device to email him if the thief ever turned it back on, he explains in a post on Hackernoon. He figured he was out the cost of a phone, but since the phone and its data were all linked to his iCloud, at least his information was secure. (And the thief was now in possession of a useless device.)
Then, more than a week later, Kiminki got an email notifying him that the phone had been found. The email appeared to come from Apple and looked just like what you’d expect to receive from the company, right down to the 1 Infinite Loop address at the bottom. Kiminki says he followed the email to a portal, which, again, looked just like iCloud, to input his user information to log in and find the phone.
On Monday, Korryn Gaines, a 23-year-old black woman, was killed by police in Maryland following a standoff in which she had taken refuge in her apartment with her 5-year-old son. According to officers, she allegedly pointed a shotgun at police after they had arrived to serve an arrest warrant, for failing to appear in court following a March traffic stop.
Now you can catch waterborne diseases and Pokémon at the Rio Olympics. Niantic released the world’s favorite augmented-reality game in Brazil on August 3, according to a post on the game’s Facebook page. The game is also now available throughout Central and South America.
In addition to athletes complaining on Twitter, the mayor of Rio posted a heartfelt plea on Facebook earlier in July asking Nintendo to bring the game to the city in time for the games. Which, maybe, actually worked. That or Niantic, being a business and all, was always planning to release the game in Brazil on the eve of one of the biggest events in the world, as thousands flock to the country with phones in hand. Either way, good news for Team USA’s Abby Johnston and Team Great Britain’s Joe Clarke, who can now stop tweeting about the lack of Pokémon Go and get back to the real task at hand: winning medals playing a video game.
The very next day, several bears wandered out of the woods and into Lake Tahoe where they splashed around in the water amidst human kayakers and swimmers. Again, video. Again, thousands of clicks.
And today, video surfaced of a bear in New Mexico who earlier this summer climbed atop a trash truck and road it for five miles.
The test was conducted by 120,586 users who had installed the OpenSignal app on their phone, which constantly monitored whether the phone was able to connect to a 4G or 3G network, and what the download speeds were for each networks.
In what must be — roughly — its five-millionth attempt at removing crud from its most profitable product, the News Feed, Facebook announced today that it’s taking further measures to reduce “clickbait.” In a blog post, employees Alex Peysakhovich and Kristin Hendrix compared the new clickbait-detection system to an email spam filter, looking at commonly used phrases in clickbait articles.
But wait! You’re saying, correctly, Doesn’t “clickbait” on the internet just mean “anything a particular reader hates”? Luckily, Peysakhovich and Hendrix lay out two main criteria for clickbait:
It’s not the first time that Facebook has established a clear role as publisher with editorial responsibilities. Its Trending Topics feature, despite its smooth algorithmic look and tone, is curated and written by a team of editors and writers — an operation that came under fire after a series of Gizmodo articles from earlier this year was seized upon by conservatives as evidence of bias.
Bad, vague, and withholding headlines came about because sites like Upworthy were able to harness what is known as the “curiosity gap” — the lack of information that makes someone want to click through. Readers, by and large, rarely get past headlines. In asking publishers to be more specific and direct in their headlines, Facebook is also asking them to eliminate incentives that might cause a user to click through to the full article. In other words, incentives that might take them off of Facebook and on to other sites.
When Facebook came under fire in in the spring for “excluding” “conservative” “news” topics (Benghazi) and websites (Breitbart) from its Trending Topics, the company made the mistake of doubling down on the idea that it was “neutral.” Rather than defend the decision — “Benghazi” is not news; Breitbart is a terrible news source — and acknowledge the fact that Facebook is built by people, who are not neutral, Facebook refused to acknowledge that the decisions it was making were largely correct, and fell back on a blinkered sense of its own neutrality. It needs to stop pretending that it is an automated system in which the machines and algorithms wield absolute power.
Be transparent about how it works and what gets removed.
Own it: Admit that Facebook is making conscious editorial decisions.
Hire a full-time staff to work on this issue.
Get a public editor.
Good columns on Inverse and Motherboard have addressed this idea, which applies not just to brands and websites on Facebook, but to individual users as well. Facebook needs to be accountable when it makes decisions to remove content at the request of law enforcement, or when safety checks get activated during some crises and not others, or when certain articles are classified as “clickbait.” Facebook needs to be more proactive in explaining why it chooses to take the action it does, when it does. It can’t continue to pretend that nobody notices these things.
If Facebook is really committed to making its News Feed and Trending Topics good — instead of just “whatever people click on most,” which is garbage — it should staff a full-time team to work on editorial issues. The team responsible for Facebook’s Trending Topics section were contract workers housed in a basement — a pretty solid indication that they weren’t a priority, and a good way to make sure you’re not hiring the most experienced and judicious editors.
This is a big one for Facebook. When you consciously make decisions about what users can and can’t see, you’re bound to mess up. Taking things down when you shouldn’t have, letting posts propagate even when they’re a garbage scam. If you are going to steer users in a certain direction, you have to be willing to publicly acknowledge when you’ve effed up.
Get ready to admit when you screw up.
Know that you can’t please everyone.
The Sisyphean task that Facebook has created for itself is to design an online ecosystem that satisfies 1.6 billion people from all around the globe. Good luck with that.
But it wasn’t just big-time movie stars who showed up in Nintendo Power — sometimes you caught glimpses of co-founders of world-changing computer companies who were also very, very good at Tetris:
This is just the tip of the iceberg of the uncut nostalgia waiting for you. There are Howard and Nester comics to peruse; extended articles on how to actually win at Battletoads (the one instance we caught Nintendo Power in an out-and-out lie, as nobody can actually beat Battletoads). The rise and fall of the SNES and N64. But one thing remains constant throughout: Nintendo Power’s consistent commitment to cover art that would withstand the test of time.
While Discover playlists come out every Monday, Release Radar playlists will be available each Friday. “You’ll soon find your personalized Release Radar playlist in the New Releases for You section within Discover on mobile and desktop,” the company explained on its blog. And unlike Discover, Release Radar tracks will be new music, which means Spotify has to figure out what songs you’ll like from your favorite artists with minimal time to collect data on song popularity. “We have an audio research team in New York that’s been experimenting with a lot of the newer deep learning techniques where we’re not looking at playlisting and collaborative filtering of users, but instead we’re looking at the actual audio itself,” Spotify’s engineering manager behind Release Radar, Edward Newett, told the Verge.
It will be interesting to see how well it works. Spotify notes on its blog that, like Discover Weekly, the more you listen to tunes on the platform the better, and more accurate, your experience will get. So far, my playlist seems pretty good (you can find yours here); of the 22 songs suggested, about two-thirds seem like things I’ll enjoy, or at least want to hear once. Of course, it would be better if it had the new Frank Ocean album on it, but for that I guess I’ll have to force myself to use Apple Music. Same for the new Britney.
Earlier this week, Apple announced it would be changing its gun emoji from a pistol to a squirt gun. (Now, if you want to threaten your friends or nieghbors via text you get to do so with a lime green fake firearm.) Not to be outdone, this week Microsoft also announced it was modifying its gun emoji. Except Microsoft took the reverse approach, turning a space blaster into a revolver.
From the official rules for news organizations:
On the one hand, yes, the IOC is entirely within their rights to determine how the event they administrate and the trademarks they own are broadcast to the world.
On the other hand, lol that’s not how it works anymore.
The 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro kick off tonight with opening ceremonies that will celebrate, from what I understand, hasty construction schedules and poop-filled water. You could watch the ceremony on NBC, on your television (like a caveman), or you can settle into what has become a pretty regular routine of catching the highlights on social media. Let others slog through the metaphorical poop-filled water of Olympic excess to find the moments of triumph.
But if you were planning on seeing GIFs or video clips online, you might want to temper those expectations. Official rules from the International Olympic Committee expressly prohibit them.
Unless the IOC has a diligent monitoring system for identifying Olympic content — and maybe they do, because as far as I can tell, the IOC is run by alien bodysnatchers forever experiencing their first day on Earth, unfamiliar with how real people operate — GIFs and Vines are going to get out there regardless.
Embedding content someone else created is the easiest way to use someone else’s work, in this case the IOC’s, and also the easiest way to avoid responsibility for disseminating it. At best, the IOC won’t really care. At worst, the committee and platforms will be playing the world’s most nihilistic game of Whac-A-Mole.
So, hypothetically, I could not produce a GIF of something happening at the Olympics, but is the IOC really going to come after me if I were to embed a GIF someone else posted on Twitter into one of my posts? On a technological level, it’s not being hosted by me, it’s being pulled from someone else’s server.
In the analog age, this type of ban was simple. But there are all sorts of thorny questions regarding safe harbor online. Big sites with millions of users like Facebook, Twitter, Vine, and YouTube are protected by “safe harbor” statutes, meaning that, in most cases, they aren’t responsible for what users post on their service. And then those sites allow their content to be embedded on other sites, which puts another layer of separation between the original content creator and its final location.
Credentialed news organizations that need to play nice with the IOC in order to get access, benefits, and resources from them might go along with this, but the (hypothetical) guy who runs the (hypothetical) epicsportsgifs.tumblr.com doesn’t give a crap. This is because the internet moves much faster than the speed of intellectual-property law, and it is much better to beg forgiveness than to ask permission. Viral Olympic moments come and go in a matter of hours, bursts of attention that flip from one clip to the next much faster than it takes to file a DMCA takedown notice, and a relative snap of the fingers compared to actual litigation.
“They needed to feel more human, more personal, more expressive,” the company, which has been working on overhauling all of its emoji for several months, announced on its blog. Because what feels more expressive than a tiny pictograph of, you know, a gun.
NBC currently has partnerships with Snapchat and Facebook to show highlights on their network, so those platforms might be more aggressive than usual in issuing takedowns. Twitter might offer a similar resources because of partnerships. But again, this is all after the fact: They can’t respond until someone posts something, and it goes viral enough to get flagged in their system.
Earlier this week, Facebook decided — not without reason — to just straight-up copy Snapchat exactly, when it introduced “Stories” to Instagram. The further Snapchat-ification of Facebook progressed this morning when the company began testing out new camera and lens options in its app. TechCrunch reports that users in Canada and Brazil who open the app will see a prompt to open the camera, rather than enter text, and they’ll be able to apply filters and facial lenses in the exact same way that they can in Snapchat.
This is the logical next step following Facebook’s acquisition of MSQRD, in March. As with Facebook’s live-video push, prompting users with the camera rather than a text box is an attempt to get users to share more and feed more data into the system, which the company can then use to earn revenue. If people are sharing less and using the app less, Facebook’s opportunity to earn money off them declines.
The lenses and filters on offer are timed to coincide with the Summer Olympics. This is only a test, though, so I wouldn’t expect to see it hit the States before the event wraps up.
YouTuber StyroPyro really likes to burn things (shocking, we know), so he built this terrifying 200-watt laser that could very easily burn your eyeballs to a crisp. For comparison’s sake, consider the fact that a typical laboratory laser is about 5 watts, and you’re not even supposed to look at those things directly.
Today in actually good news from the Rio Olympics: Ellis Hill will be headed to Brazil to watch his son, Darren, compete on the track-and-field team thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign.
Hill is an Uber driver in Philadelphia. This July, one of his passengers, Liz Willock, started chatting with him about his son during an hourlong Uber ride. When Willock heard Hill’s son was competing, she asked him if he was going to go and watch. He told her it was just too expensive.
After hearing that, Willock, who NBC reports works for a “global concierge service,” set up a GoFundMe account for Hill. It reached its goal of $7,500 in two days and the donations kept on coming. Willock is also arranging Hill’s transportation while he’s in Rio. “Outside of special things that have happened in my family, I think it’ll be one of the most important things I’ve ever done in my life,” Willock told NBC about helping Hill get to the games.
“I feel really grateful and overcome by the knowledge that there are good people out there,” Hill told People. Uber is also giving Hill $250 for dinner at a restaurant in Rio and another $1,000 in ride credit to help him get around. Here’s hoping for no surge pricing.
In a feat of technical innovation only rivaled perhaps by the wheel or the escalator, Xavier University has installed a pizza ATM that will dispense $9 pies to its student body all day long.
The machine, (which retails for $55,000, not including the price of stocking it with pizzas) hold 70 pizzas at a time. They’re pre-made by the University’s dining staff and when someone buys one from the ATM, the pizza is moved from a refrigerator and cooked in a convection oven. The whole process takes about three minutes. Which is, admittedly, a pretty excellent pace to get you a slice if it’s 4 in the morning and you’re, well, if it’s 4 in the morning and you really just need some pizza.
According to Xavier assistant vice-president Jude Kiah, pizza ATMs have a long and storied history over in Europe. (Makes mental note to move.) But this is the first to come to the States. I’d hazard a guess that at $9 and three minutes, these aren’t going to be the best pizzas the world has ever tasted. But there’s definitely something to be said for convenience.
The list of things for which robots will seek retribution against us when they take over the Earth is very long, and we seem to be adding to it day by day. Today’s entry: lining up over 1,000 plastic, humanoid robots with glowing blue eyes and shouting dance, robots, dance, as though the bots don’t have better things to do than chirpy choreography.
Earlier this August in Shandong, China, the Ever Win Company sponsored an attempt to break the Guinness World Record for most robots dancing simultaneously. (Welcome to 2016.) Each robot was controlled by an individual cell phone and in order to meet the record, the robots were required to dance, in-synch, for a full minute. The previous record, also set in China, was 540 robots. Ever Win’s new record totaled 1,007.
Not all of the bots were up to the challenge. Wired reports that 33 of them fell over during their routines, which disqualified them from being counted toward the record. That, or they just didn’t feel like submitting to their human overlords that day. (Can you blame them?)
On Sunday, Adam Peaty broke the world record in the 100-meter breaststroke and took home a gold medal for Team Great Britain. Which is, you know, fine. But the real winner was his nan Mavis, who live-tweeted her support in a series of adorable tweets that only a grandmother could get away with.
In classic seniors-using-technology form, Mavis, signs her tweets. Just to make sure Peaty would know whom they were from. She’s also pretty heavy-handed with the emoji.
Retailer Walmart announced this morning that it will acquire Jet.com, the site you always thought about ordering something from but never did, for $3 billion.
When it launched last year, Jet — which uses gimmicky pricing techniques like increasing discounts as you add more to your cart and reducing prices for using debit cards rather than credit cards — was the most aggressive start-up attempt yet to directly compete with Amazon, but, as Recode writes, it hasn’t been profitable since its launch. It’s been spending $20 million to $25 million on advertising, as anyone who takes the New York subway can tell you, but that’s not fueling growth as quickly as the company needs. Going under the Walmart umbrella gives Jet added resources. The two brands will remain separate.
But the move is as much about saving Walmart’s flagging online operation by giving it an online presence that isn’t, well, Walmart as it about giving Jet investors an exit: Jet CEO Marc Lore, who owns 25 percent of the company, will also run Walmart’s e-commerce division, which only makes about $14 billion in annual revenue compared to Amazon’s $99 billion. Lore previously sold his company Quidsi, which operated sites like Diapers.com, to Amazon after the two companies entered into a price war.
From now on I refuse to call cheering anything other than “roaring.”
By the time Peaty dove into the pool for the gold-medal final on Sunday, Mashable reports, the hashtag #OlympicNan was trending on Twitter. Sure, people were interested in watching her grandson compete, but Mavis had become a star in her own right.
Congrats, Adam, on your swim and your medal. But bigger congrats to you, Mavis, for being possibly the only pure and good soul on Twitter.
Mavis also sent some tweet love to Peaty’s teammates, proving she’s not only adorable, but extremely classy.
When WikiLeaks released 19,000 private emails from the Democratic National Committee earlier this summer, former DNC media booker Pablo Manriquez had no idea he’d be turned into a viral hit overnight. But after a series of emails documenting Pablo fighting back against his colleagues sparked the hashtag #ImWithPablo, he found himself enjoying 15 minutes of internet fame. (Since then, several of the people who squared off with Pablo have been forced to depart their roles at the DNC, so it’s pretty clear who the winner was in all this. It’s Pablo. Pablo is the winner.)
In a new Fast Company profile that reveals nothing specific about what the tech giant is up to, Apple executives sat down to discuss how everything is fine and nothing is on fire. Maybe the only interesting part comes in learning how the infamous, bungled launch of their Maps app in 2012 changed their development process.
For one thing, “several thousand” people now work on Maps, up from the relatively small dozens that initially created the program under deposed executive Scott Forstall. Secondly, it showed Apple that maintaining services was substantially different from designing and releasing annual hardware and software.
But there are hints at the company’s larger ambitions. Apple executive Craig Federighi told Fast Company, “Maps is this core organizing structure for the physical world in which you interact.” The program integrates with a number of third-party services like Yelp and whatnot, but clearly the company has grander designs for infiltrating every part of your lifestyle.
The reason that Apple runs public betas of iOS and macOS now is also because Maps was such a misfire.
“It went down hill pretty quickly when I posted #ImWithHer, that Hillary was going to wipe the floor with Trump, and that I’m planning a selfie with Hillary, Bill, Pope Francis, and me in the Oval Office next year,” Pablo told me about his first ever AMA experience.
Mr. Robot’s season-opening smart-home hack just got one step closer to reality. At Defcon, an annual conference where hackers show off the various exploits that could allow someone to access pretty much every internet-connected device you have, two security researchers, Andrew Tierney and Ken Munro, released information about a security hole that would allow outside users to install ransomware on a thermostat.
As reported by Motherboard’s Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, the hack works like this: This thermostat in particular allows users to download and install custom wallpapers through an SD card. But because the thermostat doesn’t do a thorough scan of what kind of files and executables are on the card, someone could download a nice, malware-infected picture (in this case, a moonscape), install it via SD card, and hand over full control to the hacker.
While the sequence of events needed to actually gain access would be tough to replicate — you’d need a user to download the picture to an SD card and then install it themselves on their home thermostat — the fact is that a shocking number of smart home or “Internet of Things” devices are extremely hackable.
The hacker could then control the temperature in your house until you fork over on Bitcoin. It’s easy to imagine homeowners in the middle of summer or winter just forking over the Bitcoin rather than suffer. (Though with the current price of Bitcoin constantly shifting, enterprising hackers would probably want to use another form of cryptocurrency — Dogecoin is trading nicely.) Tierney and Munro declined to say which thermostat they found the vulnerability in, as they just discovered the exploit and the manufacturer hasn’t had a chance patch up the security hole.
A wireless home-security system SimpliSafe was shown to be ludicrously easy to hack in February, with the company unable to even patch the hole because the microprocessors in the device were all “one-time programmable,” meaning whatever code was there was baked in and unchangeable. Samsung’s SmartThings home system, one of the better-selling smart-home platforms out there, was shown to have a vulnerability that allowed someone to remotely detect a homeowner setting a PIN code for their home’s locks, even texting the PIN code to the hacker shortly after. And researchers found that nine of the most popular wireless baby monitors were easily hacked — indeed, news stories about people hacking baby monitors are so common that BuzzFeed even made a listicle of the creepiest examples.

As noted by a redditor over on /r/subredditdrama (yes, really), at some point during or immediately after Pablo’s AMA, the thread was labeled “Filthy Cuck” by one of the moderators. Now, that label appears to have been changed to “Shill Alert.” Pablo was also temporarily banned from the subreddit with the warning “No Hill Shills.” “I basically walked into r/The_Donald as if it were an election press conference when what it really needed to be was a campfire discussion of the future of America,” Pablo said. “But r/The_Donald has me back now with open arms and we have much to discuss about the future of America.”
Pablo on Donald Trump [comment has since been deleted]:
Given his newfound celebrity, the natural course of action for Pablo was, of course, to open himself up to internet ridicule by hosting a Reddit AMA. (Think glorified question-and-answer thread.) The AMA was held on /r/The_Donald, a subreddit devoted to all things making America great again. (And, naturally, where Donald Trump held his AMA earlier this summer.) Not surprisingly, followers of /r/TheDonald didn’t exactly love what Pablo had to say about their man Trump. And they were even less onboard with what he had to say about his woman, Clinton.
In pretty much every home and apartment in the Western world, there’s going to be a room, or part of a room, where the furniture and seating arrangements will be arrayed around one central object: the TV. And yet, for a decade or more, that central object has largely been, well, the same. And say what you will about the Samsung Serif, it doesn’t look like any other TV currently on the market.
This is what a television looked like in 2006:
Some of this nonutilitarian design was a carry-over from old radios, which featured some truly lovely woodworking for the same reason that old TVs had those small design touches: It was something that was going to be in your home, so it might as well look good.
This is what a television looks like in 2016:
At CES this year, the main draws in high-end TVs were providing “Super Ultra High Definition” (i.e., 4K with HDR) and erasing the bezel (i.e., the edge of the screen) completely — a race to see how much of the rest of the TV beside the screen you could make disappear. The new TVs came in black, black, or also black. If you removed the brand names from the sets, I could not tell you who made what.
It wasn’t always like this. Back when TVs were first entering the house, they were designed like any other piece of furniture, which is to say they were meant to exist as part of the rest of the room, with their own design flourishes — check out the tips of the TV legs, or the simple molding on top of this TV set:
And then there’s the matter of the money. The Samsung Serif is available for preorder at $1,499, and comes with very respectable 40-inch 4K screen and smart-TV functionality. If you haven’t bought a TV in a couple decades, that might not seem so high — but taking it purely on specs alone, this Samsung KU7000 40-inch with a list price of $849.99 set seems comparable (and it’s on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart all for around $700). You’re paying something like $650 for the extra design elements in the Serif.
Whether it looks good is, well, a matter of taste — and peripherals. It’s bold and pretty much unlike anything else out there, but you hook up a PS4 or Roku or any sort of set-top box to the thing and you’ve pretty much ruined the look. But the idea of having a TV that’s attractive even with the screen off is appealing.
And that’s excellent. I hope the Serif does well. We hit Peak TV years ago, arguably around the time 4K sets hit the market, and maybe even earlier. Every new innovation offered up — 3-D TVs! smart TVs! curved TVs! 4K TVs! — hasn’t really changed the fact that, for the average TV watcher, you can get a very good TV set for about $350. If everything else has failed, maybe TV manufacturers can take a note from the Serif (and those hulking TVs from the ‘50s) — and offer TVs that look good even with the power off and come in anything besides another shade of black.
But let’s be honest: If you wanna save money, there are plenty of other ways to do so. You’ve got taste. You live in very well-appointed loft. You have advice about jet lag. The Serif is your TV.
But without the need for cathode-ray tubes, TVs no longer have to take up much space at all. They can essentially disappear into the anodyne black rectangles that sit in nearly every home in America.
This week, John Boyega served as a celebrity judge at Microsoft’s Imagine Cup, a student technology competition. As an actor best known for his role in a movie where battles are fought with droids and/or lasers (sorry, with lightsabers), Boyega seems like a perfect fit. Sure.
It’s bucking that trend that makes the Samsung Serif interesting. Designed in conjunction with brothers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec, and being sold through both Samsung’s site and New York’s MoMA Design Store, it’s a TV set that demands attention away from the screen.
TechCrunch caught up with Boyega at the end of the festivities to get his take on all things tech. (Because, why not?! Kim Kardashian has an excellent app. Let’s ask the Pacific Rim 2 guy about technology.) Boyega gave some pretty boilerplate answers about things like cyberbullying (it’s bad) and how tech can help people (he’d like to close the tech gap in the third world and improve global health). Oh, and he also talked about Pokémon Go. Spoiler alert: He’s not particularly accomplished on everyone’s favorite AR game.
From TechCrunch:
Viewed from the side, it looks like a serif-font capital I (thus the name). Overall, it looks like a piece of mid-century modern design that you can find at (relatively) cheap West Elm or not-cheap-at-all Design Within Reach. It is a TV set that makes a statement, which is something that virtually no other TV made in the 21st century can claim.
John, if you’d like to come write a think piece for us on how Pokémon Go is bringing us all together, please let me know.
This week in internet trends, people are sharing posts with the hashtag #FirstSevenJobs, documenting their career paths over the years. And this evening, Sheryl Sandberg leaned in (sorry) and added her seven-jobs list to the mix. The ex-Googler and current Facebook COO shared her list, of course, on Facebook. Her first two gigs, as Sandberg explains on Facebook, were babysitting jobs. And she was fired from both of them.
There are a few key takeaways for all you would-be babysitters. One: Don’t nap while you’re supposedly guarding someone’s kids. (Or at the very least, get better at lying about being asleep on the couch like the rest of us did.) And two: If you get fired as a babysitter, you can still run one of the world’s largest and richest companies.
As you might imagine, Sandberg’s career list takes a pretty sharp spike after those first two positions; at job five she was an aerobics instructor (!) and by job six she was working at the World Bank. Clearly, she did not list her former babysitting employers as references.
Cinch that belt, slap that arm, find that vein — we’ve got some the best and purest nostalgia going around right now. Someone at archive.org scanned in hundreds of issues of Nintendo Power. And trust us, this is the good shit.
From Sandberg:
I had no idea people were still visiting SeaWorld Orlando in the post-Blackfish economy, but it turns out they are. And if you are among those folks, here’s a piece of advice: Mind your selfies and keep your technology out of reach of the dolphins.
It’s unclear what prompted the dolphin to make the grab. Perhaps it was just saying hello. Or maybe it was offended by the baby-pink case/stand wrapped around the iPad. Or perhaps the dolphin was trying to make some sort of metaphorical comment about the continually diving consumer sales of the iPad. The world may never know.
A guest at the park this weekend learned that the hard way after one of the creatures cheerfully bit an iPad right out of her hands and dragged it into its pool. In a video shared by Fox 11 and filmed by a SeaWorld season-pass holder (again, who knew?), you can see the woman retrieve the tablet, but not before it gets a good soaking. While she hurries off looking understandably peeved, the dolphin seems relatively unaware of the several hundreds of dollars of equipment it potentially just trashed.
Turns out, Michael Phelps is an instant meme and you don’t even have to add water. While sitting and waiting to swim in the men’s 200-meter butterfly semifinal tonight, he donned his signature Beats headphones and pulled up his hood while getting into the zone. Nearby, though, rival South African swimmer Chad le Clos was jauntily shadow-boxing right in front of Phelps. Who looked, well, less than thrilled.
Following the semifinals — Phelps took second, while le Clos clocked in behind him, in third place — Phelps swore to NBC that he wasn’t paying any attention to le Clos. “I was trying not to really even look at him, ” Phelps said. “He does his thing and I do my thing.” I guess in this case “my thing” is unbelievable mean mug.
Despite the nearby commotion, Phelps remained completely unfazed. The internet took notice — it was impossible not to notice! — and, of course, began to meme. There was the Michael Phelps Gas Face:
The Michael Phelps Side Eye:
Ryan Lochte swims his first race at the Rio 2016 Olympics tonight, and thanks to his adorable grandmother, he knows he’s got plenty of people who are psyched and cheering for him.
The 32-year-old swimmer posted a video to Twitter of the 95-year-old wheeling around her nursing home carrying a homemade Olympic torch. People cheer. Grandma Lochte looks super-happy. It’s actually heartwarming. (Not to mention, Lochte and his grandmother are sporting a very similar hair color these days.)
Who knew there could be so much “Jeah!” in one family?
There’s a clear link, here, between the modern Spanish and Portuguese word for both the @ sign and a unit of weight—arroba—and the container on which this unit of weight was based, the amphora, used by both the ancient Greeks and Romans to transport liquids (and wine in particular). Cheers!
Previously, @ had existed largely as an accounting symbol, indicating the price of goods: buying twenty loaves of bread at ten cents each might be written “20 loaves @ 10 ¢”. It was also, however, a far more venerable symbol than Tomlinson probably realised. An instance of @ meaning “at the rate of” is recorded as early as a letter sent in May 1536 by a Florentine merchant called Francesco Lapi, who used it to describe the price of wine.
In his excellent new book Netymology, Tom Chatfield analyzes some of the digital world’s most popular and memorable terms — analyzing and exploring the hidden etymologies and lengthy origin stories of our era’s indispensable words. As a taste, Select All is pleased to present an exclusive excerpt, covering the sometimes occluded older origins of six symbols, terms, and expressions now tied inextricably to computers.
In 1971 a 29-year-old year old computer engineer called Ray Tomlinson created a global emblem when he decided to make the obscure symbol “@” the fulcrum of his new email messaging system. It was a good choice on Tomlinson’s part, being almost unused elsewhere in computer programming, as well as an intuitive fit for sending email to another person “at” a particular domain (email itself had existed before Tomlison’s invention, but only as a means of communication between different users logged into the same system).
Equally ancient and eccentric is the story of Apple’s “command” key, marked by a square with looped corners, or ⌘. Known sometimes as the St John’s Arms, it’s a knot-like heraldic symbol dating back in Scandinavia at least 1,500 years, where it was used to ward off evil spirits and bad luck. A picture stone discovered in a burial site in Havor, Gotland, prominently features the emblem and dates from 400-600 AD. It has also been found carved on everything from houses and cutlery to a pair of 1,000-year-old Finnish skis. It’s still found today on maps and signs in northern and eastern Europe, representing places of historical interest.
This was, he declared, “taking the Apple logo in vain!”—an unacceptable excess. Thus the company’s resident bitmap artist, Kare, found herself thumbing through an international dictionary of symbols looking for a fresh sign that was “distinctive, attractive and had at least something to do with the concept of a menu command.” The St John’s Arms fitted the bill—and, one swift bitmap design later, the command key was born.
How did ⌘ make the leap from mystical inscription to a key of its own? The answer, according to original Macintosh team member Andy Hertzfeld, is graphic designer Susan Kare. In 1983, a software meeting at Apple HQ was interrupted by Steve Jobs, who had discovered that Apple’s own brand symbol appeared next to every single item on an application’s menu.
A “Trojan” is as old as western literature itself, taking its name from the Odyssey and Aeneid’s Trojan horse, used by treacherous Greeks to gain entry to the city of Troy within a supposed gift: appropriate enough given that it describes a malicious program lurking inside a benign-seeming exterior.
But the language of the ancient world has also made a notable contribution to the positive side of modern computing. Since 1963, useful programs that run in the background rather than under a user’s direct control have been known as “daemons.” The term, an alternative spelling of “demon,” dates back to spirits found in Greek mythology. But the particular daemon the programmers who coined the term while working at MIT had in mind was a more modern kind of myth: Maxwell’s demon, an entity invented as a thought experiment in 1867 by the Scottish physicist James Maxwell.
Maxwell imagined his demon using its superhuman powers to move individual molecules around within a container, causing them to violate the second law of thermodynamics. As explained by MIT’s Professor Fernando Corbato (in response to an etymological trivia column in The Austin Chronicle, no less): “Maxwell’s daemon was an imaginary agent which helped sort molecules of different speeds and worked tirelessly in the background. We fancifully began to use the word daemon to describe background processes which worked tirelessly to perform system chores.”
Modern computer daemons tend to look after scheduled tasks on networks, answer and redirect emails automatically, or help configure hardware —hardly the stuff of myths. Better a daemon than a Trojan, though — if even the latter sounds considerably more fun.
In the tenth century, Harald “Bluetooth” Gormsson’s great achievement was the unification of warring Danish tribes under his rule. Similarly, Ericsson’s symbolic hope for its Bluetooth was to unify the “warring” range of protocols for wireless communication into a single, universal standard—something that Bluetooth has since gone a long way to achieving, being found today in over seven billion different devices around the world.
If you’re looking for an obscure icon for the digital age, the tenth-century Danish king Harald Gormsson fits the bill better than most. His connection to the cutting edge becomes considerably clearer once you add his nickname blåtand, or “bluetooth” (earned thanks, it’s rumored, either to an unpleasant gum disease, a dark complexion, a fondness for eating blueberries, or all three). For “bluetooth” was the name given in 1994 by Swedish company Ericsson to a new wireless protocol for exchanging data over short distances—one that would, they hoped, live up to the standards set by its namesake.
Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is the bread and butter of the world wide web. The term “hypertext” itself was coined as early as 1963 by the American sociologist Ted Nelson; but even this pales in comparison to both the word “markup” and many of the most common terms in online markup languages, which date back not to the first days of digital technology, but to a far earlier transformation: the birth of printing.
Printing with movable type first appeared in Europe in the fifteenth century, and was a laborious process that usually involved hand-written manuscripts being “marked up” with instructions to the printer as to how they should be presented on the page: which words should be in bold, italics, headings, underlined, or set out separately from the main text.
Bluetooth’s logo plays off this tradition, combining the Scandinavian runes Hagall and Bjarkan—King Harald’s initials—to make a single “bind rune.” It also makes a pleasant change from the distinctly conservative naming policy usually found among Scandinavian tech giants, which tend to be dubbed either after their founders (as in the case of Ericsson, named after the nineteenth-century Swedish inventor Lars Magnus Ericsson) or the place of their founding (as in the case of Nokia, named after the small town in south-west Finland).
Several of these printer’s terms survive to this day online: from the abbreviation “em” signaling “emphasis” (type in italics) to the use of the tag “strong” to signal bold type. The “chevron” style of bracket within which these terms are enclosed in HTML—“<” and “>”—is, meanwhile, even older than printing, with a name first coined in the fourteenth century based on its apparent resemblance to the rafters of a roof (chevron in Old French).
That HTML is based on English words is a historical accident — because its inventor, the co-creator of the world wide web, was the English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee (even though he was in fact working for CERN in Geneva when he created the web in 1990). And one consequence of the existence of truly global standards like HTML is the universal application of their terms. No matter what country or language a website is based in, the markup terms within it remain the same: that is, English words like “head” and “body” will remain silently present within the encoding of a page, telling every web browser in the world how it ought to look.
There’s also a pleasing physicality to many of the behind-the-scenes labels of the modern web. Consider the standard differentiation of verbal elements on a page into the “head” and “body” of a text, for example—a metaphorical division as ancient as they come.
Since its first specification in 1990, which contained just eighteen different kinds of digital “tags”—itself a 600-year-old English word of uncertain origin, and which originally referred simply to a “small hanging piece” of something—HTML and its offspring have grown vastly in complexity and terminological technicalities.
There are still etymological riches to be unearthed, however. Even that most familiar of typographical terms, “font,” carries a half-millennium of history with it, deriving ultimately from the Middle French word fondre, “to melt,” thanks to the sixteenth-century need to melt down lead in order to make casts of letters for early printing.

Prefer to surf the web with an ad-blocking extension? Facebook is coming for you. Today, the company announced via blog post that it will “begin showing ads on Facebook desktop for people who currently use ad blocking software.” Which means you get an ad. And you get an ad. Everybody gets an ad!
Under the new changes, Facebook says it will make its ads harder for blocking applications to detect. Specifically, the company will be designing their ads in a way that serves them almost identically to how the platform serves content. This way, ad-blocking software won’t know what to block and the ads will be able to get through.
“When we asked people about why they used ad blocking software, the primary reason we heard was to stop annoying, disruptive ads,” Facebook explained in its blog post. (Ads? Annoying? You had to ask?) Now, Facebook says it will offer a more nuanced ad-preference feature that explains to users why they are being served a particular ad and lets them opt out or opt to see other ads instead.
The company says that giving control to users over what marketing they see on the site is a better alternative than paying ad-block companies to show otherwise blocked ads. “It’s not a business model that’s set out to serve the best interests of people,” Facebook’s vice-president of engineering for advertising and pages, Andrew Bosworth, told The Wall Street Journal. (Not to mention, Facebook currently makes over 80 percent of its ad revenue on mobile, largely because, well, you can’t block ads in the Facebook app. Increasing revenue on desktop could be a lucrative move for Zuckerberg and friends.)
Of course, it’s likely only a matter of time before people figure out how to work around Facebook’s anti-ad-blocking changes. But then again, as the New York Times notes, building blocking technology that analyzes Facebook’s new ads on a level that can distinguish them from regular Facebook posts would be “costly and laborious.” And besides, even if somebody did decide it was worth the money and effort, something tells me that Facebook, with its multi-billion-dollar valuation, can afford to one up them again if needed.
The first few days I spent with my Amazon Echo after grabbing it on sale last month were pretty magical: asking Alexa for the weather, making Alexa tell me jokes, making Alexa apologize for telling me bad jokes, and arguing with a talking cylinder about what is, and is not, minimalist music.
But a lot of the real firepower behind the Echo is geared toward controlling your smart home. And seeing that I rent and don’t plan on staying in this apartment forever, I don’t find the idea of investing in smart-home tech just so I can ask Alexa to turn on the lights and start brewing a cup of coffee that appealing.
Luckily, you can quickly improve what you can do with the Echo thanks to its Skills feature, which allows any user to create add-on apps for the Echo. We’ve gathered together a few picks that should be useful for anyone in NYC, even if you haven’t thrown down $60 for a Philips Hue lightbulb.
Conductor: Echo comes pre-loaded with information about car traffic, but has nothing to say out of the box when you ask it if the C line is actually running. Conductor solves that. Its responses can be as vague as actual MTA announcements (e.g., “The 7 train is currently experiencing delays” without telling you in what direction) meaning you’ll probably need to pull out your phone or laptop to find out more, but it’s a nice way to double check how your commute is looking before you head out the door.
L Train: Only curious about one line in particular? Think the world begins at Union Pool and ends at Radegast? This app will tell you the running status of the L train, and in a fair amount of detail. It’s the best-designed subway app for the Echo right now: You can set your home station, and ask at any time when the next train will arrive. If there are delays on the L train, the app will also inform you exactly where and why the delays are happening. Too bad it’ll be useless come 2019.
Uber: Nothing makes you feel quite so much like a high-powered exec as yelling you need a car outside, pronto. While there’re still a few small quirks with the skill — make sure your home address on the Echo and on the Uber app match up — it quickly summons a car to your door, lets you know whether surge pricing is in effect, and lets you rate your driver once you get back home.
Lyft: Uber’s younger, more casual competitor that may or may not have smoked a little weed before picking you up actually has the better-designed Echo skill. You can have it give you an estimate of what your fare will be and find out how long it’ll take you to get to wherever you’re going before you even order a car. Especially useful for anyone who has decided to spring for a Lyft Line into work, which hooks up other ride-sharers all headed in the same direction for their morning commute.
NYC Status: Stuck in the fun limbo of street parking in NYC? This app will let you know if alternate-side street parking is in effect. It’ll also alert you when garbage collection is happening and whether there are any school closures that day. It may not be as useful in the dog days of summer, but come blizzard season, wouldn’t you rather hear about alternate-side street parking being suspended from Alexa than de Blasio?
New York Greenmarkets: Headed upstate and looking for some summer corn? The New York Greenmarkets is an exhaustive list of what you’ll find in each county of New York, from Allegany to Tioga. Find out market hours, season of operation, and exact location. Never take a road trip without heirloom tomatoes again.
Seinfeld Fan Trivia: Eventually, there comes a lull in every dinner party. But, and follow me here, what if you could play a fun round of Seinfeld Fan Trivia with a talking speaker? Put on your thinking cap, and get ready to see how you know about the linchpin of ‘90s NBC’s Must-See TV. How much money does Jerry give Elaine on her birthday? What was George’s puffy jacket made out of? What was Kramer carrying when the gang tried to find their car in the parking garage? You’ll discover who knows everything about the show about nothing, and also which of your friends hate trivia games.
Powerball Number Generator: As I said at the top, if you really want to use every bit of an Amazon Echo, you’re going to need a smart home, and for that you’re going to need to own. For any non-finance industry folks out there hoping to land a $3 million brownstone, there’s always playing the lotto. The Powerball Number Generator will give you randomly generated numbers to play. And, statistically speaking, you have a better chance of not having to split your winnings by playing random numbers. This is because when picking their own numbers, people tend to gravitate toward certain digits (e.g., 1 through 12 for birth months). Give Alexa a chance — it may pay off big. Bonus: If you win, you can hire a real-life version of Alexa called a “personal assistant.”
The ZØRE X can tell you if your gun has moved or is being tampered with, and even has drills that can time you on how long it takes to reach and unlock your weapon. It could save lives and make gun ownership safer, which is probably why it exceeded its Indiegogo fundraising goal by more than 491 percent.
A scenario: A runaway trolley car is careening down a track. Five people stand in its path, unaware of the imminent threat. You stand at the intersection of two different tracks and could, if you chose to, divert the trolley onto another track where only one person would be killed. Do you divert the trolley, intentionally killing one to save five?
Now consider the same scenario, except that instead of one person on the track, it is Harambe, the meme martyr primate.
But if the standard trolley problem illustrates the difficulty of navigating the space between “right” and wrong,” the internet’s trolley problem illustrates that that space is filled with some wacky bullshit.
The trolley problem, specifically the particular crude illustration constantly being remixed, has been floating around the web for a while (crowdsourced encyclopedia Know Your Meme traces it to 4chan). Its simplicity resembles the homespun charm and aesthetic malleability of rage comics.
This is one of the many online variants of the classic trolley problem. Developed in 1967 by Philippa Foot, the trolley problem attempts to render into visceral example the thorny questions of utilitarian moral theory. Will you make the intentional decision to kill, or let events unfold without intervention? Either way ends in pain.
And some of those possibilities are elaborate, to say the least.
To that end, Aljoša Toplak and Haris Sehic created the Facebook page “Trolley problem memes,” which posts, well, you know. “[W]hen you think about it you see that it can be modificated in so many ways: you can recreate real life events, paradoxes, other famous thought experiments,” Toplak told the Huffington Post. “There are so many possibilities!”
Lexically, the trolley problem also provides an easy template to riff on. In April of 2015, Kyle York published “Lesser-Known Trolley Problem Variations” on McSweeney’s, including variants such as “The Real Stinker” (“But get this: that one worker? It’s your fucking mom. Bet you weren’t expecting that shit, were you?”).
There are trolley problems about libertarian principles …
Trolley problems about the Old Friends Senior Dog Sanctuary …
Trolley problems that combine not with other ethical dilemmas, but with other meme formula …
And some that are just weird.
All of these feed into a larger content ecosystem of philosophy memes, where the objective is often to one-up other memers in creating the most complex thought experiment. Ones that are almost Escheresque in their construction.
Without overly complex thought experiments, however, academics might be put out of a job.
It’s a decision that’s likely to play well with digital publishers, the group of businesses most concerned with ad-blockers. Publications are increasingly turning to tactics like earnest pop-ups asking readers to turn off their ad-blockers; Facebook has enough muscle to actually sabotage the blockers themselves.
This smart showerhead will attach to your shower and flash different colors at you depending on how much water you’ve consumed. A potential distraction from the goal of getting clean? Maybe. But just think how much more fun shower karaoke will be with the proper lighting.
Amazon’s Echo comes out of the box with a fair amount of functionality, but Amazon wisely decided to open up its always-on voice assistant to outside developers in the device’s Skills section. There’s some truly useful stuff in the store — we outlined some of them over here — but there’s also some wonderfully batshit stuff as well. Here are three of our favorites:
Attention, all of you would-be Olympians out there. Here is a small piece of advice. Should you train for years and earn a place among the world’s top athletes (and that one comically terrible men’s diving team from the Philippines), leave your phone at home on game day.
Flat Earth Facts: It’s common knowledge that the Earth is not a sphere but instead a flat plane, with the so-called “South Pole” actually serving as a gigantic ice wall that no one can escape. But getting your friends to see the truth can be hard. As the Flat Earth Facts creator puts it: “Go ahead and ask Alexa for a flat earth fact and she can now tell you or your doubting friends about the true shape of the world. Don’t take NASA’s word for it. None of their pictures or videos are real and they admit that. Find truth here.” Sample fact: Did you know that planets don’t exist in the flat-earth model? They are simply celestial lights in the firmament. Checkmate, skeptics. The only downside is that this app does not come with a B.o.B. soundtrack.
Conversation Starters: One of the toughest parts of meeting new people and dating is just trying to make small talk. You don’t want to break out the heavy stuff right away (“Well, I guess the main issue with my father was …”) but you don’t want to just talk about the weather either. Luckily, Conversation Starters is there for you, and Alexa can do all the asking. “What is your least favorite volunteer experience?” Alexa might ask your date as you both settle in. “What is your dream memory?” Alexa will inquire while you signal for a second round of drinks. “Tell us about your first love?” Alexa will ask while you figure out how to split the bill. Just make sure wherever you take your date has a power outlet and a good Wi-Fi connection, because otherwise you’re on your own, champ.
Secret Keeper: Have a secret you’re just dying to unload, but no one to tell it to? There’s Secret Keeper, which allows you to tell your Amazon Echo a secret and then give it a unique password to lock it away forever, unless you give someone else that password. So, purely hypothetically, if you wanted to tell Alexa,”I hit a kid in my car in Arkansas one night and just kept driving and am now living and working in New York City as a tech writer under an assumed name and it all just happened so fast,” Secret Keeper will listen and keep that secret safe. And you will, hypothetically, feel a weight lift off your shoulders and your heart and your soul that you have been carrying for so, so long.
During a fencing match Monday night, France’s Enzo Lefort made this mistake and had to listen as crowds booed after his phone fell from his pocket mid-match.
Lefort went on to lose the match to Germany’s Peter Joppich. But here’s hoping he got a few good selfies out of the deal.
Online shopping is a huge industry. I know this. You know this. But guess who also knows this: dogs. Dogs have been attacking postal workers more and more because postal workers are delivering more and more packages from Amazon (or other fine retailers!).
To that end, the USPS introduced a new feature to its handheld scanners called “Trip Hazards,” which lets deliverymen and -women log hazards on their routes. The feature was induced in May ahead of National Dog Bite Prevention Week, which sounds fake, but there’s a week for pretty much everything now so who knows.
Every time you order four pounds of Haribo Sour Spaghetti in bulk from Amazon (which I did not do last Friday), you’re putting someone’s well-being on the line. Think about that.
According to Ad Age, “Attacks on postal employees are on the rise – in 2015 alone, they jumped 14% to 6,549, officials said.” A spokesperson for the United States Postal Service specifically attributed the rise in canine chaos to a “double-digit increase” in packages. Online commerce shipments were up roughly 35 percent between 2011 and 2015.
In a way it resembles the now-classic “your girl” meme, which reworked racist bodybuilding hypotheticals (“This guy slaps your gf’s ass. What do you do?”) into wackadoo scenarios (“Jared Leto’s twisted The Joker slaps your girl’s ass. What do you do?”). The meme has since been reworked into a scenario in which horny men are tempted by anything remotely resembling a butt. The humor lies not in how people answer these questions, but in the scenario itself. (I love to explain humor.)
If you’re already watching Olympic livestreams from your desk during the day (I think I’m fired now) and staying up watching NBC well past prime-time hours, adding some of the world’s best athletes on Snapchat should be the next step in fueling your Olympiad obsession. We’ve rounded up 15 members of Team USA who are reporting live from Rio with shirtless selfies, videos from training sessions, and the occasional camera-roll upload.
Long-distance relationships are hard. Being far away from your significant other for an extended period of time is not fun. (If that is fun for you, you might want to consider, you know, getting out of your relationship.) But even if I spent eight months of the year in Moscow while my partner lived in Topeka, I can’t think of any good reason to spend money on a set of tech-enabled rings that allow you to feel the other person’s heartbeat.
Chinese swimmer Fu Yuanhui won the bronze medal during the women’s 100-meter backstroke final on Monday, but somehow managed to get out of the pool after the race without realizing she’d landed a spot on the podium. Instead of seeing her time on a scoreboard or hearing it announced, Yuanhui found out she’d be taking home some Olympic hardware during a post-race interview. (In her defense, she shared the third-place medal with Canada’s Kylie Masse, who finished at the exact same time as Yuanhui.)
“What I want to share is that even though I did not win a medal,” Yuanhui begins, before the broadcaster clues her in and a huge smile breaks across her face. “Well, then I think that’s not bad at all,” she says. (Watch all the way to the end to see her stumble off with what looks like a particularly painful muscle cramp.) The clip currently only has a few thousand views but is already making it’s way to the top of /r/videos, so it’s only a matter of time.
During yesterday’s semifinals, Yuanhui also made headlines for her adorable reaction to finding out she had sliced a full second off her time and made it into the finals. Similarly, it was a newscaster who filled her in. Maybe it’s time for a new prescription for Yuanhui. Or not. She’s an Olympic medalist, she can do whatever she wants.
The Touch’s HB ring works by connecting through an app on your phone, which then allows you to link the two rings even when you’re not together. Then whenever you want to check in, you just tap a button on the ring that will trigger your partner’s ring to send pulse data to your device. (That is assuming your partner’s ring is on, charged, and connected to a phone that is also on and charged. Otherwise, things get pretty morbid in a hurry.) Aesthetically, the rings are kind of cool looking, with a thick, black exterior band that lights up with a thin red line while it pulses to your significant other’s heart rate. The devices come in two color schemes: black stainless steel ($600 for a set) and rose gold ($3,000 a set). You’ll get about 14 hours of active battery time before needing to recharge the ring.
But even if you are “Scrooge McDuck diving into a pool of money”-level wealthy, it just seems like there are better ways to spend $600, or even several thousand dollars, that might be more beneficial to your relationship. Like a plane ticket. Or a new iPhone. Or some stamps. Or really anything other than these rings.
Google’s Chrome browser is gearing to take the final steps to put Flash out of its misery. If you don’t use Chrome, you should start considering doing the same for your own browser of choice.
A blog post from Anthony LaForge, curator of Flash for the Chrome team, explained the timing and reasoning behind the move.
Name: Simone Biles
Expect to see: Lots of selfies from Biles and the rest of the Final Five featuring ample gold medals. (And Biles still has several chances to rack up a few more before the games are over.) Also, find out what one of the best gymnasts in history does in her downtime. (Hint: There’s a lot of Modern Family.)
Sport: Gymnastics
Name: Ryan Lochte
Sport: Swimming
Expect to see: Lochte, like you, has a thing for Snapchat filters. Come for the clips of his silver-haired face turned into a bumblebee, stay for the “Jeah!”
Name: Mikaela Mayer
Sport: Boxing
Expect to see: Mayer’s first match isn’t until Friday, so she’s been snapping a lot in between training sessions while she’s getting ready to fight. Recent snaps include an impromptu freestyle rap session about winning gold medals.
Name: Steele Johnson (Yes, really.)
Sport: Diving
Expect to see: Mirror pics, Rio geofilters, and plenty of cameos from Johnson’s diving partner, David Boudia. (You can also follow Boudia on Snapchat at @DavidBoudia.)
Name: April Ross
Sport: Beach Volleyball
Expect to see: When she’s not dominating on the court, Ross is exploring Rio, cheering on the rest of Team USA, and keeping followers up to date on her nutrition routine. (So many acai bowls.)
Name: Kerri Walsh Jennings
Expect to see: Jennings (who is April Ross’s partner) is the only athlete whose excitement and energy holds even as she is dunking herself into an bathtub filled with ice. Watch her on Snapchat and get pumped for your day.
But that’s just the first step. Come the holiday season, Chrome is going to stop loading Flash altogether with the exception of a few sites:
The second Steve Jobs declared that iOS and iPhones weren’t going to use Flash, the clock was ticking on the 20-year-old software platform. And for nearly two years, it’s been the conventional wisdom among tech geeks that Flash should die.
Here’s a how to turn off Flash in every major browser right now, and stay ahead of the curve on what Chrome is going to do anyways.
In Chrome:
1. Type “chrome://plugins” in the URL bar.
2. Find the plug-in that says Adobe Flash Player.
3. Click disable. Live your life.
In Firefox:
1. Type “about:addons” in to the URL bar.
2. Click the plug-ins icon on the left-hand sidebar menu.
3. Find Shockwave Flash, and switch from “Always activate” to “Never activate.” Be free.
In Internet Explorer:
1. Click the gear icon in the upper right-hand menu.
2. Click “Manage add-ons”
3. Find “Shockwave Flash Object” and click on it.
4. Hit disable. Maybe, if you are using IE and are on Windows 10, think about upgrading to Microsoft Edge. It’s pretty good!
In Microsoft Edge:
1. Hit the menu button in Edge (it’s the three little horizontal dots in the upper right).
2. Scroll down and hit “Advanced Settings.”
3. Find the toggle for “Use Adobe Flash Player” and click it to off. Go and Flash no more.
In Safari:
1. Click “Preferences” in the top menu bar under “Safari.”
2. Hit the “Security” tab.
3. Click the “Plug-in Settings” button.
4. Find “Adobe Flash Player” and uncheck it. Feel suddenly much lighter, much freer.
In Vivaldi:
To the extent that they can be classified, memes generally belong to one of two broad families: “relatable” and “ironic.” Relatable memes attempt to convey a feeling or emotion; ironic memes prey on relatable memes by undermining the underlying formats and preconditions of their existence.
Here are two memes featuring Bill Clinton at last month’s DNC. This one is relatable:
This one is ironic:
For as long as the memescape (defined by new media scholars Bradley E. Wiggins and G. Bret Bowers as “the virtual, mental, and physical realms that produce, reproduce, and consume Internet memes”) has existed, this loose taxonomic structure has enabled meme scholars to create vast organized classifications. But over the past several months, a third genre of meme has emerged, and its possible effect on the field is not to be underestimated. I am talking about wholesome memes.
Wholesome memes are post-ironic, meaning that they convey love, affection, and genuine friendship by recontextualizing classic meme formats. The creators of these memes are aware of the jokes that widespread image memes represent but use them to display warmth and empathy. Consider this alternate, smiling version of Pepe the Frog.
It has nearly 86,000 notes on Tumblr as of now. Tumblr is where wholesome memes have grown and thrived over the course of 2016. (Case in point: That 86,000-note Tumblr post is a screenshot of a tweet that only received 25 retweets and 24 likes.) In some posts, users collect various macros that all revolve around the theme of “I love my gf.” Consider: an “upgrade” button that now reads “I love my gf.”
Or this twist on Liam Neeson’s classic line from the film Taken.
The Tumblr blog wholesomemes has taken to collecting this new class of meme, and scrolling through its archive, it’s obvious that the genre is playing with tropes in the same way that ironic memes do, using what the artist Hito Steyerl defined as “poor images” as well as crudely Photoshopped alteration to turn an ironic or relatable meme into one about love or comradery. They convey the message that someone made a shoddy, heartfelt effort to craft a bespoke wholesome meme for their partner.
Name: Sam Dorman
Expect to see: Most of us nonelite-athlete types will never get to see the inside of an Olympic Village, much less live in one. Dorman’s snaps take you behind the scenes of Rio’s infamous housing for the teams from around the world. Also get up close and personal with the now-green Olympic diving well.
These are memes that celebrate how poorly they’re done, how putting in a little effort to tweak an existing meme can be a term of endearment. If ironic memes play on the viewer’s knowledge of the memescape in order to provide some critical distance, wholesome memes use viewer knowledge to foster genuine communication. An ironic meme says, “You and I can comprehend this silly thing, and should feel bad about it.” A wholesome meme says, “You and I know this silly thing, and it has brought us closer together.” One might argue that wholesome memes are just a new form of ironic meme, playing not on the structure of the memes but on the generally tongue-in-cheek and often self-deprecating nature of relatable memes. But they serve distinct purposes. Ironic memes ridicule extensive meme knowledge, but a wholesome meme sends the message that meme literacy is nothing to be ashamed of. Relatable memes are for everyone, ironic memes are for those anxious about being in on the joke, and wholesome memes are for those no longer afraid to be in on the joke. Wholesome memes are the first type to admit that it’s not embarrassing to communicate through memes.
And they’re spilling off of Tumblr. Accounts on Twitter solely dedicated to these images are popping up. One tweet on wholesome memes from last week now stands at around 8,900 retweets.
What remains to be seen is whether or not wholesome memes can permeate the only social network that truly matters, Facebook. Irony is pervasive on Tumblr and Twitter, but meme formats truly take off once those sites are raided by Facebook users (and transitively, Instagram). Without understanding what wholesome memes are playing off of, these images mainly resemble the earnest “I love my grandkids” images and videos that Facebook content specializes in. Because Facebook is so interested in real-world identity, users can’t help but act cordial by default. Hell, up until this winter, the main (arguably only) method of interacting with a post was to click the Like button. The active Facebook community is too large to be anything but earnest. It’s sincerity by committee. Can wholesome memes make the transition?
Name: Serena Williams
Sport: Tennis
Expect to see: Even though she’s out of the competition for medals, Williams is still hanging out in Rio. Also, she’s one of the greatest athletes of all time so you should probably already be following her.
Name: Carmelo Anthony
Sport: Basketball
Expect to see: This is your chance to find out everything you ever wanted to know about the cruise ship the U.S. men’s basketball team is hanging out on off the coast of Rio during the games.
Name: Breanna Stewart
Expect to see: Stewart has been snapping from the stands as she cheers on other members of Team USA. Follow to feel, at least a little, like you’re sweating it out in Rio watching women’s beach volleyball as a spectator.
Name: Rickie Fowler
Sport: Golf
Expect to see: Rickie Fowler has his own Snapchat filter and he is not afraid to use it. Add him to see the 27-year-old golfer narrate his day today in Rio above a cartoon picture of his own face.
Is the Pokémon Go trend ever going to pass? Hopefully not, for the sake of the people behind the Vixole Matrix, a pair of “smart” sneakers billed as making you better at catching ‘em all. A Kickstarter for the shoes is launching next month (and who knows when they’ll actually be available), so lets keep the momentum going, kids.
Name: Jake Dalton
Expect to see: Despite the fact that he’s, you know, competing at the Olympics, Dalton has been taking the time to snap words of thanks to his fans, in addition to shirtless gym selfies.
Name: Kassidy Cook
Expect to see: If you’ve ever wondered how professional divers recover from their training sessions, Cook is your woman. She’s been documenting her ice baths, rubdowns, and early-morning wakeup calls.
Name: Jake Kaminski
Sport: Archery
Expect to see: Kaminski took home a silver medal earlier this week and has been showing it off (rightfully so) on Snapchat. Turns out Olympic medals also come with very cool cases.
Name: Greg Billington
Sport: Triathlon
Expect to see: Billington’s event is Thursday, so his snaps thus far have mostly been from his final training sessions.
1. Haha, just kidding. If you are using Vivaldi you probably not only have Flash disabled but Java as well and are reading this after bouncing off a couple of proxies.
The reasons range from Flash being a memory- and battery-hog to the myriad security holes that pop up in Flash on a near-daily basis. Plus, turning off Flash comes with very little downside — almost every site you visit won’t be affected, unless you have a particular affection for old Flash-based browser games or are still just really fucking digging that one Pharrell site with the 24-hour “Happy” music video.
To add them, open the app on your phone and take a picture of the yellow Snapcode next to each person’s name. You’ll see a pop-up notification where you’ll need to tap “Add Friend” to confirm. Or you can swipe down from the Snapchat home screen, tap “Add Friends,” and manually type in their username.
Today, the White House announced it was going full-on 2016 with a new bot for Facebook Messenger. Now if you want to drop Barack Obama a line with your thoughts on international terror or dank memes, you can just type and send.
“Our goal is to meet people where they are,” the White House explained in a press release, showing a clear understanding that “where people are” is staring blankly at computer screens all day long. “It’s about creating opportunities for people to engage with their government in new and accessible ways, using the same technologies we already rely on in our daily lives.” As for the likelihood of the president actually reading your message, Obama reads ten letters from citizens every day and messages sent via the bot will also be eligible for this. This means your chances probably aren’t great, but you have to play to win, right? (The Olympics are really getting to my head this week.)
Still, it takes less time to fire off a few sentences on a computer than to write a traditional letter and pop it in the mail. (After you go out and buy new stamps, because when was the last time you sent a letter anyway?) Now, it’s just a matter of figuring out what you want to say to Obama and making sure there’s nothing on your Facebook you wouldn’t want the government to see. (Though, who are we kidding, they’ve probably already seen it anyway.)
Snapchat is a very successful company run by very smart people. They have a popular app! They have hundreds of millions of target-demo daily users! They have been at the forefront of a new stage of the internet, in which content and messages are ephemeral, increasing share and decreasing digital anxiety. But — as Snapchat has demonstrated in the past — it is not above making short-sighted, insensitive decisions.
Snapchat popularized lenses, the automatically applied facial masks that let you look like a dog, or a Viking. Or a racist caricature.
Yesterday, app users noticed a new filter that replaced a user’s eyes with squinting ones and enlarged their front teeth, resembling antiquated racist caricatures of Asian people.
Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Snapchat said that the lens, intended to resemble the anime art style, won’t appear in the app again.
This is not the first time Snapchat has faced criticism over one of its lenses. On April 20, the weed day, the company released a Bob Marley filter that some saw as a type of digital blackface.
The clip opens with a stylized mascot of the MooreBot jumping into place of the second o in MooreBot while wearing a bath towel, which gets blown away. The MooreBot is ashamed, despite having no visible genitalia — either it has been programmed to feel the same shame as a human would, or programmed to believe that it actually has genitals when it in fact has none. Regardless, this moment is supposed to induce sympathy for the MooreBot. This is deception. The MooreBot deserves no sympathy. The MooreBot is a monster.
If you want a picture of the future, imagine a one-eyed robot staring at a human face — forever.
That’s the promise of MooreBot, which launched an Indiegogo campaign yesterday with one of the most subtly terrifying pieces of film I’ve seen since the diner sequence in Mulholland Drive.
We then get introduced to the actual, real-world MooreBot. The designers have obviously taken their visual cues from a variety of sources, from the murderous HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey to the psychotic and deeply lonely GLaDOS in the Portal video-game series. And the film is quick to drive home the point that no matter where you are, the MooreBot will be there too.
Almost immediately, the MooreBot starts to take over family life, fragmenting and splintering it. The MooreBot watches the child and mother closely, while the father watches from afar on his phone, nodding in approval. A family with the MooreBot does not need him there — he would only get in the way.
Next we start to get a sense of the MooreBot’s abilities. The video claims it is a “Fast Learner,” which apparently means that it can quickly learn how to control a child’s mind, forcing the child to mimic MooreBot’s own motions. This is not a robot that you will program; this is a robot that will program you.
The MooreBot also follows the father to the office, quickly taking over the flow of information. The father’s body will do what the MooreBot wants it to do, the father’s mind will know what the MooreBot wants it to know.
Indeed, the MooreBot seems intent on controlling the father’s life. For instance, it induces him to stay in bizarre positions for minutes at a time.
Back at home, the MooreBot tells the child things that quickly cause the child to close her eyes, asleep and dreaming whatever the MooreBot has decided she will dream.
Finally, the denouement. The child has drawn a picture of the family. But she has forgotten something and quickly adds it in. Something vital. Indeed, something that at this point can be said to be the family with more authenticity and ownership than the humans that make it up. The camera slowly pans down, farther and farther, to reveal the ever-watchful eye of the MooreBot.
We finally reach the climax of the horror film with a birthday party for the father. The MooreBot, having so completely taken over the father’s life and his family’s life, has infantilized him to the point where he requires birthday balloons and a cheap paper crown to wear. If he cannot be an active participant in his family or his own life, perhaps the crown can give him some semblance of control. Or perhaps it’s simply a cruel trick being played on him by the MooreBot, a sign of its complete dominance. Wear this crown, sing this song, says the MooreBot.
After two days on Indiegogo, the MooreBot is currently more than halfway to its funding goal. If you’d like to try the Moorebot for yourself, you can get an early donor’s discount and grab one for just $159. They start shipping in November. Hold your family close.
Reveling in its glory, the MooreBot cannot help itself: It must have this moment forever. It must have pictures. But where are the pictures stored? What about the other MooreBots? Are there other families with parents wearing paper crowns? Do the MooreBots share these pictures of the families they have mastered amongst themselves? The answers are left to the viewer, but do give some places for the filmmakers to go if they choose to make a sequel.
Tonight, Team USA’s Kerri Walsh Jennings and April Ross defeated their Swiss opponents in beach volleyball. (The pair will continue moving toward their gold medal hopes in round 16 later this week.) But as the game heated up, the NBC commentator handling the event briefly forgot what sport he was announcing. Instead, he blurted out “Katie Ledecky!” mid-match as Walsh Jennings and Ross scored a crucial point.
It’s unclear exactly what prompted the outburst. It’s possible, as some people on Twitter noted, that Ledecky walked into the stands at that exact moment. (Though that seems unlikely given she has the freestyle relay finals this evening.) Or perhaps the announcer was pulling double duty and commenting on something meant for a different broadcast. More likely, the announcer was just so moved by Walsh Jennings and Ross dominating the court that Ledecky’s name was the first thing that popped into his mind.
We’re still looking for a video clip of this excellent moment. (And when we find one, we promise not to make any GIFs. Okay, IOC?) But in the meantime, please proceed to intone Katie Ledecky’s name anytime something good happens to you. Win the lottery? Katie Ledecky! Make the subway just before the door closes? Katie Ledecky! Eat a bagel? Katie! Ledecky!
Sure, winning a medal at the Olympics for a sport is impressive. But sports are played out. The real question is: Who hit the best dab?
Vine star Logan Paul, dabbing behind Gabby Douglas during the women’s artistic-gymnastics team final, gets points for his spirited tank top and excellent arm form. Deductions for trying to steal the spotlight while an actual Olympian did her thing, for being a Vine star, and for the fact that this isn’t the only event Paul has dabbed at in Rio.
Swimmer Ieuan Lloyd dabbed while entering the aquatic center to swim the 200-meter individual medley. Following his dab, Lloyd came in sixth place for Team Great Britain in the semifinal, which, unfortunately, means he will not advance to the medal round. Still, we’re giving him a solid second-place finish for this dab. Points for posture and being totally unashamed of his choice of entrance.
English Gardner, who is an American sprinter, dabbed behind teammate Allyson Felix during Felix’s opening-ceremonies interview. Gardner is the clear winner for several reasons. First, just look at the intense focus while she’s staring at the camera. This is a woman who is mentally ready to dab. And don’t forget the added degree of difficulty in her performance: She not only dabs, but does so while videobombing her teammate, who never even notices.
Since the Games kicked off last Friday, we’ve seen a handful of spectators and athletes alike hitting the dab (a dance move credited to Atlanta artists like Skippa Da Flippa, and later popularized by NFL player Cam Newton, that involves quickly raising your arm and dropping your head into the crook of your elbow). But the Olympics is, of course, a competition. And so we’ve empowered ourselves, in the style of an International Dab Committee, to award medals. Ladies and gentlemen, please stand.
“The fact that we’re here is a freakin’ miracle,” Gawker CEO Nick Denton said last night, addressing a crowd from the base of an enormous set of stairs. You could be forgiven for not being quite sure where “here” was. Gawker’s enormous new offices? The year 2016? A week away from sale at auction?
One particular absence stuck out: A.J. Daulerio. Daulerio, who edited Gawker in 2012, was personally named in the Hogan suit; the Florida jury found him liable for $100,000 in damages, even though he demonstrated that he’s already $30,000 in debt. Now, he, too, will have to file for bankruptcy.
Undeterred by the odd wheat-paste campaign and the possibility of Gamergate pranksters, Gawker personalities young and old reunited to remember the company that all but invented modern digital-media practices. Nearly every one of Gawker’s editors was in attendance. Elizabeth Spiers, Gawker’s first editor and later the editor of the New York Observer, stood near Denton as he spoke; in the audience was her successor, Choire Sicha, founder of the Awl; across from Spiers was Sicha’s successor, Jessica Coen, now editor-in-chief at Vocativ.
The feeling of last night’s party, held to mark the end of Gawker’s independence, was, unlike the product that Gawker and its sister blogs put out, understated. Not quite funereal, but not at all celebratory: a wistful, sad, and sometimes angry wake. Denton, executive editor John Cook, and Gawker’s president and general counsel Heather Dietrick each made brief remarks, ranging in tone from mournful to strident, all celebrating Gawker’s 14-year history of brave, if sometimes reckless, truth telling.
Gawker filed for bankruptcy last month, and Denton was recounting, to an audience that knew the story very well because most of them were characters in it, how the experimental, one-man tech blog he launched in 2002 had become Gawker Media: enormously influential, widely read, consistently profitable, and, now, brought to its knees by a professional wrestler, a Florida judge, and a Facebook billionaire.
Earlier this year, a Florida jury levied an enormous $140 million judgment against the company over a 2012 post that excerpted a video showing Hulk Hogan having sex with a friend’s wife. The lawsuit was later revealed to have been funded by the Facebook billionaire Peter Thiel — the subject of a 2007 Gawker story titled “Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.” Gawker has appealed the verdict, but Florida law requires that a bond be posted during the appeals process; in order to gather the money to post that bond, Gawker was forced to declare bankruptcy and sell its assets. That the gathering happened at all was a small triumph. Gawker had to go request permission from its creditors to host the party on a meager $1,000 budget. Next week, the company’s assets will go up for auction, and the famously independent blogging collective will end up with a corporate parent.
Daulerio, who edited Deadspin prior to taking over Gawker, is beloved at the company, and it wouldn’t be hyperbolic to say that, in his absence, his name carried the weight of a martyr. “That Roger Ailes is walking away from a 30-year career of sexual abuse with $40 million, and A.J. Daulerio is trying to figure out how to file for bankruptcy, is enraging and absurd to me,” executive editor John Cook told the crowd. “I can’t think of anyone who has sacrificed more than A.J. Daulerio for the good work this company has done.”
Hanging over all of the proceedings was the threat of further litigation. The same lawyer Thiel paid to represent Hogan is representing two other defendants suing Gawker, as well as former writer Sam Biddle and John Cook, “the menschiest man that Roger Ailes tried to tag as an anti-Semite,” Denton joked.
“The sacrifices that have been made are not limited to the people who have been sued,” Cook noted, bringing up the frequent harassment faced by writers for the women’s site Jezebel, and the video-game site Kotaku. “I have lost friends that are in this room tonight because of Peter Thiel’s decades-long campaign against this company.”
It seemed that Gawker had indeed spent less than $1,000 on refreshments. Less than two hours after the event started, the alcohol was gone. People began to filter out; some of the veterans of Gawker’s earliest eras were planning to meet up at Tom & Jerry’s, their old Soho haunt. More recent employees milled about, one by one making their way to the off-limits third floor. Someone had procured more beer, and the party could continue upstairs.
“I’m incredibly proud of how the team has stuck together through this tricky time,” Denton said. “We’ve shown, with our backs against the wall, the kind of character and determination and verve and style, and I think we can absolutely be proud of it.” He pointedly toasted Gawker’s coders, its ad sellers, its hard-working lawyers (“who have contended with a tech billionaire’s well-funded, well-organized, clever scheme”) and, of course, the writers.
Plastered around the area surrounding Gawker’s Union Square offices were “Guilty” posters featuring Nick Denton’s face, casting the CEO as ringleader of a lawless organization that has long carried out journalistic malpractice. During Denton’s remarks, a woman named Emily Youcis, denied entrance to the party, situated herself near the door and heckled the CEO. She later accosted Denton as he exited the building; Youcis’s footage is posted on the YouTube channel of Got News, an organization founded by right-wing activist Chuck Johnson. (Gawker Media sports site Deadspin once relayed a rumor that Johnson had taken a shit on the floor of his college dorm. Johnson sued and was laughed out of court.)
Last month, California passed a law that will require anyone assembling a 3-D-printed firearm to obtain a serial number from the Department of Justice, a process that also requires submitting to a background check.
On Monday, Facebook rolled out a new plan to keep people from using ad-blockers on the platform. And now, just two days later, there is already (though not surprisingly) a work-around. Adblock Plus (which does exactly what its name implies) has figured out a way to stop users from seeing Facebook’s newly redesigned ads.
Last week, Instagram introduced its new Stories feature, which lets users post photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours. It’s just like Snapchat! Except that, thanks to a new Google Chrome extension from developer Alec Garcia, you can view those stories from a web browser, and not just the first-party app.
Under Facebook’s latest changes, ads are no longer coded distinctly as ads — the idea being that if ads were effectively indistinguishable from user content, then users would abandon their ad-blockers, because the blockers would also hide content they’d actually want to see. Except, as it turns out, the new ads are still distinguishable from user content … at least somewhat. According to a statement given to the Verge by a Facebook spokesperson, in addition to blocking ads, Adblock Plus is also hiding some user content.
The technical details: While Instagram doesn’t offer a publicly accessible API endpoint for grabbing Stories data from the service, Garcia was able to reverse-engineer it by using a proxy to view SSL requests sent to and from his phone.
This allowed him to access API endpoints that supplied data for the Stories tray which now appears at the top of the app, and the contents of those Stories. With a few clicks, you can view Stories and download their contents.
If users are sharing more sensitive information, that raises the security stakes substantially. That someone was able to figure out how to download and view Instagram Stories from a browser less than two weeks after launch signals that Instagram and its parent company, Facebook, haven’t thought everything through. Case in point: According to our testing, viewing Stories using Garcia’s extension doesn’t send read receipts, allowing viewers to see and download Stories content without the original author knowing. That’s a huge liability for a company that wants to encourage people to share more content with reckless abandon.
For all of the gripes that Snapchat’s app-only stance engenders, it also gives itself and its users far more control and information about who is seeing their content. Instagram doesn’t seem to care about those risks — it just wants you to post more.
Garcia’s resourcefulness is to be commended, but the fact that it was so easy for him to figure it out should be worrying. When Instagram rolled out its Stories, founder Kevin Systrom made a big deal out of calling Stories a “format,” rather than a feature — and therefore fair game for copying from Snapchat. But a fundamental quality of Snapchat Stories is the fact that they’re only accessible via the app, and not through browsers. This is a good thing — one of many dampening effects that give Snapchat its feeling of privacy and ephemerality. The promise of Stories, on Snapchat at least, is that they’re accessible in only one particular way.
So for now, if you really must block ads on Facebook, you run the risk of missing out on some posts from family and friends. (Though if you’re still friends with most of the people you went to high school with, that might not be such a bad thing.) And if — or, more realistically, when — ad-blocking tech gets smart enough to fully isolate these new ads from general content, it seems like Facebook is prepared to change things up again, in what Adblock Plus’s Ben Williams calls an ongoing game of cat and mouse. “But for this round of the cat-and-mouse contest, looks like the mouse won,” Williams wrote on the company’s website.
From Facebook, via the Verge:
Back in my day, people were taught to drive with the old “ten-and-two” motto for steering-wheel hand placement. And while that clockface arrangement might have shifted with the evolution of airbag technology, one element has remained constant: hands. You are (with a few, noted disabled-driving exceptions) supposed to be driving with your hands. And you’re also not supposed to be texting. Got it? No texting and keep your hands on the wheel.
In case that’s still fuzzy, here is a terrifying video of a woman in Pennsylvania driving with her feet while texting, courtesy of 6ABC Action News. This is a great example of what not to do.
Someday in the future, when we all ride around in totally autonomous cars and never have to speak to human beings, this will be totally chill behavior. But until then, please put the phone, and your feet, down.
Donald Trump gave a speech today for the National Association of Home Builders. At one point during said speech, the fair-haired Republican nominee held up a sign. (What for? I don’t know. I watched the speech video on mute.) Naturally, it wasn’t long before people online started editing that image, covering the sign with memes and turning Donald into one in his own right.
Rob Flaherty, the deputy digital communications director for the Clinton campaign, started the thread on Twitter, when he posted a modified picture of Trump holding up a blank sign.
And go to town people did. There were Harambe jokes.
And Dat Boi edits.
Name a meme, and there is a good chance somebody photoshopped it onto Donald Trump’s sign. (Fair warning: Some of the rest of this thread is great and some of it is hot garbage, so proceed with caution.)
The meme has also migrated over to Reddit’s /r/photoshopbattles, where Trump will join a cast of past characters including the Queen of England, a two-legged cat, and this intern who fell asleep on the job. (Guessing he’ll feel right at home with that last one.)
Adults who are feeling addicted to their technology sign up for this summer camp to escape the constant stress of their day-to-day lives. Camp Grounded offers four days in the wilderness, where campers can connect with each other and forget about all the hassle their technology often brings.
Camps have been offered in Northern California and New York, and will take place in North Carolina and Texas in the coming weeks and months.
Wednesday afternoon, Olympic gold medalist and gymnastics phenom Simone Biles tweeted this:
Still confused? Biles’s teammate Laurie Hernandez replied with a reaction meme featuring Gavin.
Ah, yes, Gavin. The guy we all know and love. Gavin!
There he is! Gavin.
At a time when the eyes of the world are upon Biles and Hernandez performing miraculous athletic feats, the eyes of Biles and Hernandez are on some kid named Gavin.
“Not the most family-friendly thing we’ve ever made,” Mastodon admitted when I spoke to him on the phone, “but most people seem to enjoy it. And throughout that time in 2013, I started putting my nephew Gavin, who was 2 at the time — he would appear in my videos. And people thought he was cute, but they didn’t really take notice of him a whole lot.”
Well, “some kid” is underselling it: Gavin is the 5-year-old nephew of Vine star Nick Mastodon, a 30-year-old from Minnesota who was one of Vine’s earliest stars thanks to his videos combining Disney movies with Top 40 hits. In November of 2013, he made the viral “Suck a Dick” vine (22 million loops and counting) with his friend Dustin Hatzenbuhler.
“People started to comment about his reaction and how great it was,” he recalls. “And I was like, Let’s find other ways to capture him in funny situations and see if he can make that face some more. He just made a whole lot of different faces; it’s just something he seems to be good at without even trying.”
In the spring of 2014, Mastodon posted an innocuous video of Gavin with a crested gecko on his forehead. He wasn’t expecting much of a response, but it blew up.
Gavin kept appearing on Nick’s Vine account over the next two years, and then, all of a sudden, Gavin started blowing up. “It wasn’t up until, like, this past June that he really blew up, and I think it was because more and more big meme accounts were posting pictures of him.” Meme accounts like @chanelpuke and @tinatbh and the like, which trade and copy memes from each other like playing cards. (Know Your Meme credits the account @wedecideit with blowing up Gavin’s spot.) Once they had drawn attention to Gavin, he was everywhere.
With dozens of Vines to choose from, it was easy to find a Gavin reaction face for any situation. I went from not knowing who Gavin was to seeing 20 different pictures of him in the span of a few days. On Instagram, his mom, Katie, has roughly ten times more followers than she did two months ago.
In addition to the Team USA shout-out, Gavin has drawn the attention of stars like Katy Perry and Skai Jackson. Shawn Mendes invited Gavin to his show when he was in town.
The attention of celebrities in tweets like Biles’s are a good indication of just how megaviral Gavin is. “Those types of things are just fun,” Mastodon says, “because they were just talking about him and just addressing him, referring to him on a first-name basis. And I think that that’s really powerful, to show how popular he is or how recognizable his name is.”
Exactly how aware Gavin is of his internet fame is up for debate. Fans ask to take pictures with him, and he knows that they know him from Vine, but the sheer scale is lost on him. “The only thing I worry about, really, is that he would ever resent any of us for making these videos and posting these pictures,” Mastodon admitted. Some of the money Mastodon makes from doing sponsored Vines goes toward Gavin’s college fund. “I think that it will definitely come down to how we explain what’s happening or how it happens. I’m hoping that he thinks it’s cool. I’m hoping that it’s not something that he gets teased about. I think his parents feel the same way.”
For the foreseeable future, though, Gavin will continue to grace our screens with his presence. All hail #KingGavin.
“I think the word phenomenon is a good word for it,” he said. “There was definitely a buildup to it, but the fact that all of a sudden so many people are using his pictures and his videos, and there’s Twitter feeds or streams of our old Vines and some of the newer stuff, and just the rate at which this stuff is getting shared is pretty incredible.”
Update: The moderators over at /r/photoshopbattles have since removed the Trump sign submission as edits involving signs are no longer permitted according to the subreddit’s rules.
Michael Phelps won his 10,000th (approximately) gold medal Thursday night in the men’s 200-meter individual medley. That is, unless you were watching the race in Canada, where CBC announcer Elliotte Friedman got slightly confused about who was swimming in lane four and called the race, loudly, for Ryan Lochte.
“Finally, he’s going to do it! Ryan Lochte is going to beat Michael Phelps in this event in the Games,” Friedman shouted as Phelps (or Lochte, if you’re Friedman) finished the race nearly a body length ahead of the second-place finisher. “And Phelps might not even make the podium!” This was true, except it was Lochte, not Phelps, who didn’t make the podium.
Friedman isn’t the first announcer to get a little tongue tied during the Olympics. Earlier this week, an announcer on NBC blurted out “Katie Ledecky” after Kerri Walsh Jennings and April Ross scored a point during their beach-volleyball match. Luckily, he seems to be taking it in stride. (And Canadian Twitter users seem like the nicest people on Earth.)
Early this morning, someone impersonating pharmaceutical millionaire and gleeful troll Martin Shkreli sent an email to roughly 456 people, most of them journalists, offering an exclusive listen to a track off of Wu-Tang Clan’s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, the infamous one-copy-only album Shrekli paid $2 million for last year. The recipients were not BCC’d. You can probably imagine what happened next.
Yes: The reply-alls began. (I, lowly blogger that I am, was not included on this thread. It was forwarded to me by a colleague who is clearly illuminatus.)
Friendly reminder: Replying all asking people to stop sending emails is like shushing a crowd. Just adds more volume.
Eventually, the real Shkreli was looped in on Twitter and denied his involvement in the email chain. He has also since been added to the original 456 people.
If you too would like to join this hellscape, just reply to Shkreli’s tweet. Assuming he hasn’t blocked you for being a “future welfare recipient” under the age of 30 masquerading as a journalist.
At this point, both myself and Microsoft Outlook have lost the ability to keep track of this runaway email chain. So I’ll just leave you with its most recent missive.
Prolly :(
Here’s a small sampling of emails that have been sent since Martin got in on the fun. (Sorry, Holly.)
Whether you’re trying to find something very cheap but not crappy or willing to toss the equivalent of the GDP of Angola at the best TV screen possible, we’ve got some suggestions.
Thanks to endless years of sharp-elbowed competition and the entrance of Chinese manufacturers to the market, you can walk away with a very respectable TV for less than you’d pay for an okayish cell phone.You won’t be able to get a 4K TV, which the TV industry has collectively agreed to call “Ultra HD” and is basically a TV with double the number of pixels of most older screens, but, for now, that’s really not much of a loss — there are very, very few shows and movies displayed at that resolution right now. At this price range, you’ll be sticking to a 40-inch screen at 1080p resolution, which is the same display resolution as pretty much any TV you’ve bought in the past five years. Just be prepared to buy a TV from a brand you’ve maybe never heard of. Here are a few suggestions.
If You Don’t Want to Explain What a “Sceptre” Is When Friends Visit: Samsung UN40H5003 40-Inch 1080p LED TV (2014 Model)
TCL is a Chinese brand that’s been manufacturing parts for other TVs for a while, but only recently started selling to the consumer market. This 40-inch TV is aggressively priced and comes with built-in Roku integration, which saves you $80 if you don’t have a Roku, and saves you the headache of juggling a TV and Roku remote. Plus the Roku TV interface is hands-down easier to use than any smart TV I’ve messed around with. The two major downsides: You can get slightly better visual fidelity on other TVs for a similar price, and there’s no ethernet cable input — if your home Wi-Fi sucks, you’re up the creek. As a cord cutter who streams 90 percent of the media I watch, this would be the TV I’d pick.
If You’re a Cord Cutter and Are Sure to Let People Know It: TCL 40FS3800 40-Inch 1080p Roku Smart LED TV
If you’re willing to go back in time a bit, you can pick up a TV from a brand you’ve heard of for $235. The picture quality is reported to be excellent and the sound is good out of the box, and this TV has a good number of ports for bringing in other media sources. It isn’t a smart TV, which in this case (as in most cases) is a good thing — the smart-TV interface that Samsung was putting out in 2014 was, uh, not well thought-out. This is the model you want if you’re looking to go with a tried-and-true manufacturer.
For People Who Actually Follow Through on Those Buy-10-Get-1-Free Stamp Cards: Sceptre X405BV-FHDR 40”-Inch LED Class Full HD-TV
Sceptre, a badly spelled budget brand made by Hitachi, puts out a bare-bones TV with a quality image. (It’s popular among PC gamers who use it essentially as a huge computer monitor.) It reportedly comes out of the box with terrible sound, but it’s also currently listed for $208 on Amazon, and I’ve seen it listed for as little as $179 elsewhere. That’s money you can invest in a decent sound bar or a set-top streaming box. If you already own either of those things, this 40-inch TV is a steal.
If you’re looking for the TV that’s going to be your mainstay and are willing to spend a little, there are a few things to keep in mind. At this price point, you’re going to want to go for 4K (we’re just gonna use that term throughout the rest of this article, because Ultra HD sounds like what the latest Street Fighter game would be called). Secondly, you should aim for larger size over other doodads — you’ll always appreciate a bigger screen more than having QBL, or Quadprocessor Bifurcated Lensing, a term I just made up. Finally, if you can swing it, get HDR, or High Dynamic Range, which is a buzzword that basically means being able to show more colors at brighter and darker levels. Here are three great TVs for under a grand.
If You Buy a Honda Civic Every 7 Years: LG Electronics 60UH6150 60-Inch 4K Smart LED TV
The LG 60UH6150 gives you everything you want in a modern large-screen TV. It’s got 4K resolution, which may not do a ton for you right now, but which you’ll enjoy a few years from now as more and more providers start moving over to higher resolution. It’s got HDR, which is most noticeable during dark sequences in movies and TV shows — no more boosting the brightness on your TV during a night scene. It comes with WebOS 3.0 smart TV interfaces, which, of the smart-TV operating systems I’ve used, is the most intuitive and least annoying. And finally, it’s got a wide axis of viewing, which is a fancy way of saying you can look at it from nearly anywhere in a room and it won’t look like a laptop screen tipped too far back.
If You Really Don’t Want to Mess With Cable TV Ever Again: TCL 65US5800 65-Inch 4K Roku Smart LED TV
Sharp is a bit of a wild-card brand right now. The Japanese manufacturer announced in 2015 that it would stop making Sharp-brand TV sets and outsource the work to the Chinese manufacturer Hisense, while still selling the sets under the Sharp brand name. That said, the TVs being made by Hisense and marketed as Sharps are racking up high marks for image quality while still not wrecking your bank account. The Sharp LC-65N7000U comes with 4K resolution, HDR, and local dimming, all of which means that everything you watch on it is going to look very good, particularly in dark scenes. Its built-in sound system has also scored high marks with reviewers, meaning you can possibly avoid spending on a sound bar. It comes loaded with smart-TV functionality, but having messed with Sharp’s smart TVs at CES, I’d say you’re probably going to want to find a set-top box instead. Still, if you’re looking for the biggest TV with the best picture under $1,000, the Sharp is the best option out there.
This TCL is a lot of TV for a relatively little amount of money. The out-of-the-box Roku functionality really can’t be overstated — having Roku be the primary interface with your TV is the best option out there right now. Plus, Roku will highlight 4K streams for you, making it easier to find things to watch that will let you internally justify buying a 4K TV. And unlike its smaller cousin above, this model has a direct ethernet input, which you’ll want, since streaming 4K requires a pretty dang fast connection, and a wired connection is always going to be faster than a Wi-Fi one. The downsides? No local dimming, which is a TV-nerd term for making dark parts of the screen darker, and no HDR. Still, for a 65-inch TV that does this much for you, it’s a bargain. (Note: If you’re willing to live with a smaller screen, the TCL 55P130 55-inch Roku TV is also quite good, $300 cheaper, and comes with a Roku remote you can plug headphones into — a great addition if want to watch something loud without annoying everyone else in your home.)
If You Buy 25-Pound Tubs of Peanut Butter at Costco: Sharp LC-65N7000U 65-Inch 4K Smart LED TV
I’d like you to think back to 1997. It was a simpler time. A better time. A time when a kid could be a kid, and you could call a neon-colored gummy candy composed of nothing but sugar a fruit snack, and get away with it.
If price isn’t a concern for you and you’re looking to buy a new TV, you’re in luck. After a few years of TV tech plateauing, the last two years have seen significant leaps forward in image quality and form factor. If I were in a Brewster’s Millions–type scenario, these are the TVs I would buy:
If You Dream of Owning Your Own IMAX: Sony VPL-VW350ES 4K Projector
I’m not a huge fan of curved TVs — while they promise a more immersive experience with the screen expanding out into your peripheral vision, in my experience it usually just feels like watching, well, a curved screen. That said, at Samsung’s CES floor show this year, this was the TV everyone was gathered around, and there’s a good reason for that. At 88 inches, the screen seems to swallow you up, and Samsung’s HDR and local dimming are incredibly quick and responsive, meaning the color contrast is sharp, and the dark tones are nearly as good as what you get with an OLED. At this size, watching anything feels like watching something in 3-D, thanks to the subtle difference in depth around you. It also comes with a 3-D option, which I wasn’t able to try, but has gotten good marks. If you have your heart set on a curved TV, this is the set to get.
If You Refuse to See Anything Not in IMAX: Samsung UN88JS9500 Curved 88-Inch 4K Smart LED TV
LG is currently the only manufacturer making OLED (or Organic Light-Emitting Diode) TVs, which means that they are making the best TVs available. I could go on for a while about what makes OLEDs so neato, but the main thing to know is that OLEDs, unlike LEDs, don’t use a backlight — each pixel lights up on its own. Think of a regular LED TV as being an extremely complex Lite Brite — a pixel on the screen is turned a certain color, and then light is shot through it from behind to illuminate it. Even if you insert a black-colored peg, it’s still going to illuminate every so slightly from the light behind it. OLEDs, however, illuminate each pixel individually, no backlight needed. What this means in the real world is that dark colors are shockingly dark onscreen, because there’s simply no (or very little) light coming from them, while bright colors seem to pop that much more in contrast. The jump in quality from an LED screen to an OLED screen isn’t as jaw-dropping as when everyone moved from old-school SD to HDTVs, but it’s close.
If You Regularly Slip $100 Bills Into People’s Hands for Better Service: LG Electronics OLED65G6P Flat 65-Inch 4K Smart OLED TV
The G6P also comes with a host of other features besides its remarkable screen. It’s incredibly thin — equivalent to the size of four credit cards. It comes with a built-in Harman Kardon sound bar that you won’t need to replace — it produces hefty bass and clear sound in both the mid- and high-range. (Though, of course, there are always higher-end audio options — if you plan go that route, choose the EF9500 OLED that comes without a sound bar instead.) And while 3-D TVs of the past were rightly treated as a gimmick, the G6P’s 3-D mode can be taken seriously. The combination of the high-contrast and high-detail resolution makes for a wildly better experience than the 3-D TVs of the late aughts and early 2010s. (You still have to wear those goofy glasses, though.)
Projectors come with a whole slew of caveats. You’re also going to need to get a projection screen. The lamps inside of them will burn out after a set number of hours (500 hours, and then a $499 replacement bulb in this projector’s case). And you’ll need to have a room with both a big enough wall and the ability to shut out external light to really take advantage of it. But if you can do all those things, you’re rewarded with a truly massive screen: This can project an image up to 120 inches. And that extra size does matter — small details that the human eye just can’t make out on even a 65-inch TV are suddenly very apparent on an 120-inch screen. The Sony VPL-VW350ES is actually the cheapest of the 4K projectors out there right now, but it’s been well-reviewed across the board for having the best image quality. While you may be waiting a while for more 4K content show off on your 120-inch screen, in the meantime, you’ll be getting the closest experience to going to the movie theater that you can have at home. The only downside is there’s no celebrity trivia before the film starts.

I watched from feet away as Simone Biles went through her uneven-parallel-bars routine to monstrous cheers. I watched as German gymnast Sophie Scheder missed the top bar after a release and whoofed in a mat, to audible cries from the audience. I was able to turn around and peer into the stands, then look around at the cameramen rushing around the arena. I rubbed my temples and blinked my eyes extra hard, because I could already feel a low-grade headache coming on.
As part of its Olympics coverage from Rio, NBC Sports and Samsung teamed up to offer the chance to watch events in virtual reality, using the Samsung Gear VR headset. I was legitimately excited to check it out. After about 20 minutes of watching, I was legitimately excited to take off the headset.
Which, on the face of it, is not a terrible idea! After all, we watch the Olympics on our TVs and it’s (mostly) great. The real problem is that the 360-degree camera being used in Rio is shooting some very low-resolution video. Watching gymnasts, it was hard to make out faces or much else beyond the general outline of bodies in motion. Usually the only people I could clearly make out were the photographers directly beside wherever NBC Sports had set up the camera.
The problem is related to whatever camera tech is being used in Rio. The 360-degree cam being used is monoscopic (i.e., one camera) versus stereoscopic (i.e., two slightly offset cameras), meaning that none of the images had depth: Watching men’s boxing with one eye closed was exactly the same as watching it with both eyes open. While I could look in any direction, nothing seemed particularly near or particularly far away. When the camera changed position, the boxers were suddenly bouncing off the ropes right above me, and they seemed very large, but not very close. The experience can best be described as being in a small sphere with a 2-D TV all around you.
The problem wasn’t Samsung’s Gear VR, a platform that I think is one of the best chances to break VR out of its niche gamer audience and get it into the hands of a wider one. There are multiple games and small experiences you can do in the Gear VR that I’ve enjoyed immensely, and which give you the thing that virtual reality does so well: a sense of being somewhere, of scale and presence — that full-body feeling of being on top of something very tall, or being very small and looking up at something very large.
It was also the year that birthed a series of bizarre ads for said fruit snacks that have haunted my dreams ever since. In them, any kid who ate Gushers immediately had their head turned into a giant piece of fruit. Suddenly your pals and classmates were walking, talking apples and oranges. Truly inspired stuff.
Snapchat has repeatedly come under fire as of late for creating filters that are racially offensive or bear a striking resemblance to art created by other people, but I’m going to go out on a limb and say that the giant-fruit-head filters are pretty innocuous. Not sure what the statute of limitations is for Gushers’ ownership of the giant-fruit-head space, though. Either way, Gushers should probably cut Snapchat a check for the best free product placement they’ve had since 2002. (Well, the best free product placement they’d had since 2002, until I wrote this post.)
Over the past few weeks, these repressed memories came flooding back to me in the form of Snapchat filters which let users turn their faces into over-sized raspberries, strawberries, and pineapples. Here at Select All, we first made the Gushers comparison back in May, when Snapchat released a branded Taco Bell filter that let users render themselves as massive hard-shell tacos. (As did a number of Twitter users.) It’s a comparison Snapchat seems to have taken quite literally. (Snapchat did not immediately respond to request for comment.)
It all quickly becomes exhausting for the eyes and brain. Your eyes badly want to focus on what’s in front of them, and your brain is trying to make sense of why these things that are so close are so blurry and occasionally doubled.
And this shouldn’t be a problem! I was using a Galaxy S7 Edge, Samsung’s latest flagship phone, which can easily display high-resolution images without breaking a sweat. Using the Gear VR, I’ve watched multiple videos shot in a high-resolution stereoscopic video, and the effect is incredible.
There was also the issue of stitching together the 360-degree image from multiple cameras. There were certain longitudinal lines where everything was slightly doubled. If I swung my head into the right position, it was as if I was suddenly and catastrophically drunk. This wasn’t a huge deal when those stitching lines were in the stands or by the judges’ table. But during one boxing match, it was directly in the middle of the ring. I took to closing my eyes when the boxers approached the stitching line.
There were still small bits of amusement to be found. Because watching the gymnasts was so frustrating, I began to track people who clearly did not think they were on-camera. I saw a few people openly yawn, and a few tired officials staring off into nothing, clearly bored at this point of watching another 19-year-old’s floor routine. I saw that, during the vault part of the gymnastic competition, there’s a neat little camera the zips along a track, following the gymnast as he or she sprints forward.
It’s these little moments — the ability to peer around and direct your attention where you want it — that continue to make me want this whole VR thing to pan out. Great VR allows for you to experience things in a way that fools your autonomic system. Peer over a ledge in VR, and you immediately want to take a step back. Have something into your “space” in VR, and you start trying to move aside, the same as you would if someone crowded you on the subway.
Which is why I hope people aren’t watching the Olympics in VR right now, especially if it’s their first time using a headset. Because with the NBC Sports app as it stands right now, it would be easy to assume that virtual reality is not so great at making you feel like you’ve been physically transported to another place — but, instead, is pretty good at giving you a late-afternoon headache.
An organization called Liter of Light is helping communities with limited access to electricity harness green technology to light their streets and homes. And the way it works is shockingly simple.
Over the weekend, Usain Bolt defended his Olympic title in the 100-meter dash in Rio. While polishing off the final meters in the semi-final, the gold medalist glanced over his left shoulder for a few milliseconds. Which was just long enough for Bolt – with his face locked in a slightly pained grin, his legs moving so quickly they’re a blur, and his competition in his wake – to become a meme.
The Jamaican sprinter still has two more events left before the Games are over, which means plenty of opportunities for more memes … I mean medals. There are plenty of opportunities for Bolt to win more medals. (Who are we kidding? I very much meant memes.)
Pokémon Go! It’s the best game ever created and nobody is getting tired of it, but there’s always been one major problem with it: Not only do you gotta catch ‘em all, but you gotta use your hands.
But inventor and literal genius Simone Giertz solved that problem with the Pokémon Go helmet. Boasting “more degrees of freedom than America,” the helmet will finally allow you to catch a Charmander with your face while you use use of your hands for everything from “getting an education” to “touching people.”
The only downside? Per Giertz: “I have no plan sell this shit because this helmet makes me feel stupid.”
Today’s lesson in Tinder etiquette: Be careful whom you ghost. After watching Singaporean swimmer Joseph Schooling beat Michael Phelps in the 100-meter butterfly final in Rio, University of Texas student Sabryna Salazar thought his named sounded familiar. “The announcers kept saying he was a Longhorn [UT’s mascot] so I looked back through my Tinder matches and found out it was him,” Salazar told BuzzFeed about Schooling. Who, in case you’d forgotten, is now an Olympic gold medalist.
Props to Schooling for opening with a line better than “hey.” If anybody needs me, I’ll be digging through my Tinder matches, looking for Olympians.
Meet Hedberg, a bionic hand crafted from parts of a Keurig coffee machine. He took almost 200 hours to make, which is a lot — but look! He can clutch a glass cup. And at least now we know what to do with those things now that they’ve been widely exposed as the uncool, environmentally unfriendly makers of mediocre coffee that they truly are. Wonder what we can make out of those soda machines …
On Saturday night, American swimmer Katie Ledecky shattered her own world record in the 800-meter freestyle, with a time of 8 minutes, 4.79 seconds. The runner-up, Jazz Carlin from Great Britain, finished more than 11 seconds behind her.
Unfortunately, you won’t be able to see the video anymore, because “This Tweet from @JimmyDonofrio has been withheld in response to a report from the copyright holder.” That copyright holder is presumably the International Olympic Committee, which licenses exclusive rights to film and broadcast the Olympics to select networks. In the United States’s case, that’s NBC.
A similar tweet from Matt Allaire illustrated that the gap between Ledecky and Carlin was enough time to hear the first lyric from Vanessa Carlton’s “A Thousand Miles.” You won’t be able to view that clip either for the same reason.
Claiming the title with a world record is one thing, doing it in such a decisive victory over every other competitor is another. It’s nearly unfathomable. On Twitter, Jimmy Donofrio figured out an ingenious way to illustrate the gulf between first and second place. “You get all the way to ‘Man, it’s a hot one’ before the next swimmer finishes after Ledecky,” he wrote.
The accompanying video showed Ledecky finishing, and then in the lower-left corner of the frame, began to play the music video for “Smooth,” the smash-hit collaboration between Carlos Santana and Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty. Sure enough, the music video gets all the way to the iconic opening lyric, “Man, it’s a hot one,” before Carlin finishes in second. (Fact check: While the duration from the start of “Smooth” through MIAHO is 12 seconds in the music video, it is 18 seconds on the version included on Santana’s 1999 album Supernatural.)
By the time Donofrio’s tweet vanished, it had been retweeted more than 22,300 times (it’s difficult to gauge precisely how many people eyeballed it, but anecdotally, a tweet of mine with 8,700 retweets has so far resulted in 1.2 million impressions; make of that what you will). Needless to say, the tweet was very popular, because it was funny and inventive and provided a great frame of reference for people who might not otherwise care about the Olympics. It’s better marketing than anything NBC has done for the past week and a half.
Now it’s gone — because Twitter believes it to be a violation of copyright law — though not before the tweet went viral. As we noted earlier this month, the attempt to ban unauthorized video clips and GIFs of the Olympics hinges paradoxically on that content going viral enough to get the IOC’s attention.
But the thing that the IOC is clearly banking on, successfully, is that the internet moves much more quickly than takedown disputes do. Currently, Ledecky’s feat is old news; the viral photograph of Usain Bolt is the hot new thing.
Per their copyright policy, if Donofrio were to dispute the takedown, here is what he would have to provide to Twitter:
It is also pretty easy to argue that the video isn’t actually a violation of copyright law! The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (ostensibly) protects the fair use of copyrighted works in ways that are transformative, meaning that they build upon the original work, and that are noncommercial. Donofrio’s tweet, which combined two copyrighted works, was transformative — the song and video only work in combination. The video was also less than 20 seconds excerpted from an event which lasted 8 minutes. That’s hardly the same as, say, posting the entirety of Usain Bolt’s 9.8-second 100-meter dash.
In an odd way, our digital-media copyright mess results in a situation where it seems like everyone wins. Donofrio gets to go viral, the IOC gets some attention for an amazing Olympic moment, Twitter gets to prove to content partners that it cares about their intellectual property, and the rest of us get to listen to “Smooth.”
And that’s not even mentioning the fact that it is to Twitter’s benefit to privilege large multimedia partners over individual users. Keeping the IOC happy means that the IOC will continue to direct attention to Twitter (through official partners only). Today, the New York Times reports that Twitter is pursuing a livestreaming partnership with the NFL, in addition to the numerous other sports deals it’s made. It’s relying on sports organizations to drive user activity, and they will always take precedent, unless users want to fight them on principle. And who on Earth has the energy to do that?
That’s a lot of effort for one person to take against a large organization over a silly video. Twitter’s response would likely take weeks or months, and the video would almost certainly not be resurrected until after the Olympics have long ended.
Prior to today, I was completely unaware of the fact that “dressage” is basically elevated equestrian speak for horse dancing. I am now, obviously, completely hooked. Particularly when it involves horses dancing to the internet’s favorite song: “Smooth” by Santana featuring Rob Thomas.
A closer inspection of the horse’s number (221) reveals this is Spain’s Severo Jesus Jurado Lopez (and his horse Lorenzo) performing his grand prix freestyle routine in today’s individual final. While the pair will not be bringing home a medal, they were a clear fan favorite at the event in Rio.
So smooth.

We interrupt your regularly scheduled Monday-afternoon programming to bring you this very important news flash: A research team found a tiny, purple squid and it is excellent and you need to see it.
The E/V Nautilus team spotted the creature last week off the coast of California, CBS LA reports. Known formally as a stubby squid, the little guy is actually more closely related to a cuttlefish than a squid and is native to the Pacific Ocean. Because it’s 2016 there is, of course, a livestream you can watch of the exciting moment the team finds the squid.
“It looks fake,” one of the crew members remarks very scientifically during the stream. “He has weird eyes,” adds another. “Will you just look at that purple blob,” I shouted to no one in particular at the office after seeing it.
Thank you for reading. You may now return to whatever it was you were actually trying to do this afternoon.
On the eve of Gawker Media’s sale to … somebody, the author of its bankruptcy, Facebook billionaire Peter Thiel, was graciously given op-ed space in the New York Times to lay out his case against the blog network. Thiel, who funded the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that brought Gawker to the point of sale, casts his intervention as just one good deed in a crusade against privacy violations. That a man who became superrich thanks to a timely investment in Facebook, and who is an investor in surveillance contractor Palantir, is arguing for greater privacy protections is about the least-striking contradiction in the whole op-ed.
Since Thiel’s involvement in the Gawker case came to light, it’s led to hand-wringing about the possibility that billionaires like Thiel could bury adversaries in the media under expensive litigation by funding court cases that don’t directly involve them. Thiel — who had no case against Gawker himself — funded Hulk Hogan’s case against Gawker, the one in which a jury awarded Hogan $140 million and bankrupted the company, calling it “strategic deterrence” back in June.
Thomas disputed this last June when he looked back on the blog post, in the San Francisco Chronicle.
Thiel’s umbrage with Gawker dates back to 2007, when Owen Thomas, a writer for Gawker-owned site Valleywag, published a post called “Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.” By Thiel’s account, the post outed him, revealing his sexuality: “I had begun coming out to people I knew, and I planned to continue on my own terms. Instead, Gawker violated my privacy and cashed in on it.”
“I will support him until his final victory — Gawker said it intends to appeal — and I would gladly support someone else in the same position,” Thiel now writes. The final part of that sentence is a not-so-thinly-veiled threat to anyone who might report on deep-pocketed individuals like Thiel.
Thiel’s argument that his litigation is in support of defending individual privacy from prying journalists falls apart when you consider a few things. Firstly, Thiel is a prominent investor in a number of Silicon Valley efforts to harvest personal information and undermine individual privacy, chief among them, as noted above, Facebook and secretive law-enforcement contractor Palantir. As Anil Dash points out, Facebook’s recklessness when it comes to user privacy outed gay users to advertisers and earned the company two decades of federal supervision.
If the indemnification clauses in those writers’ contracts are nullified by the bankruptcy court, that leaves Biddle and Cook responsible for funding their own defense against Harder, and likely against Thiel’s bottomless pockets — even though, again, neither suit has anything to do with the privacy protections Thiel claims to be so passionately protecting.
In addition, Gawker is now the subject of two other lawsuits likely funded by Thiel (the lawyer funded by Thiel in the Hogan suit, Charles Harder, is representing the plaintiffs in both cases, though nobody will confirm that Thiel is once again footing the bill). One concerns journalist Ashley Terrill, the other Shiva Ayyadurai, who claims to have invented email. Neither lawsuit is related to privacy; both concern defamation.
In his op-ed, Thiel does not explain why those lawsuits also target individual writers and editors at Gawker. The Hogan suit has nearly bankrupted A.J. Daulerio, who was reported last week to have only $1,500 left in his (frozen) checking account. The two other suits name former writer Sam Biddle and current executive editor John Cook.
“It is ridiculous to claim that journalism requires indiscriminate access to private people’s sex lives,” Thiel writes, a misrepresentation of Gawker’s legal defense strategy. That strategy had argued that because Hogan had repeatedly bragged about his sex life in public, the details of it would be of public interest. (Oddly enough, Thiel admits, “Since sensitive information can sometimes be publicly relevant, exercising judgment is always part of the journalist’s profession.”) Unsealed documents also indicate that Hogan filed the lawsuit as a defensive move to prevent records of his use of racial epithets from becoming public, not out of embarrassment.
“A free press is vital for public debate,” Thiel writes while actively funding litigation that will certainly produce an industry-wide chilling effect. “It’s not for me to draw the line,” he admits, while drawing that line.
Perhaps the oddest part of Thiel’s essay is during its endorsement of the Intimate Privacy Protection Act, a bill pending before Congress which “would make it illegal to distribute explicit private images, sometimes called revenge porn, without the consent of the people involved. Nicknamed the Gawker Bill, it would also provide criminal consequences for third parties who sought to profit from such material.” Exactly who is calling it the Gawker Bill? As BuzzFeed reports, a spokesperson for its sponsor, Representative Jackie Speier, said, “I have no idea where ‘the Gawker Bill’ name comes from, but it’s incorrect.” It’s mostly being called that among publications like the Daily Caller and Gateway Pundit, in the famously tolerant right-wing blogosphere.
At this point, Michael Phelps has won enough Olympic swimming medals to tile the floor of a small bathroom or use them as coasters at a well-attended dinner party. He’s reportedly retiring following the Rio 2016 games. (Though we’ve heard that before.) But perhaps if he does actually retire this time around, Phelps will consider pursuing golf in his newfound free time.
Given Phelps played the tournament with a handicap of 26 over par (read: not great), the 159-foot putt is even more impressive. To date, it is reportedly the longest televised golf putt ever. Michael Phelps: Even when he’s not great at something, he’s still probably better at it than you are.
Earlier today, a redditor resurfaced a video of the swimmer playing a round at a Pro-Am tournament in 2012 and sinking a comically long putt. “He couldn’t,” the announcer quietly comments. “He has,” he follows up, at a slightly louder but still tasteful volume.
Bahamian runner Shaunae Miller secured the gold medal on Monday evening in the women’s 400-meter Olympic finals in Rio by diving headfirst with outstretched arms across the finish line. The move helped her narrowly defeat Team USA’s Allyson Felix, who took the more conventional route of, you know, crossing the finish line on two feet. The photos of the event that resulted were essentially the opposite of the photos of a grinning Usain Bolt pulling ahead of his less-godlike competitors.
Except that, as with Bolt and many other Olympians who have come before her (like Phelps, that horse dancing to “Smooth” by Santana featuring Rob Thomas), Miller’s unorthodox finish has made for some excellent memes.
There’s less than a week left to go until the Olympics end, much of the world stops caring about sports again, and we have to go back to our old standbys for fresh memes (Tumblr and Donald Trump).
It’s hard to think of a game that got more prerelease hype in this decade than No Man’s Sky. There was a 6,500-word write-up in The New Yorker a full year before its release, multiple pieces on The Atlantic’s website, and, of course, the breathless coverage from the video-game press every time another game-play trailer dropped. The game’s creator, Sean Murray, even went on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, where Colbert joked that Murray had replaced Morgan Freeman as God.
Why the hype? Size. Sean Murray and his team at Hello Games used an algorithm and procedural generation to create a universe of 18.4 quintillion unique planets — that’s 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 planets, if you want to be precise — and you can travel to, and explore, each and every one. If you have 600 billion years to spare.
The basic concept of procedural generation is simple, even if the execution can be mind-bendingly complex. Instead of handcrafting each level, like, say, how legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto carefully planned World 1-1 of Super Mario Bros., developers using procedural generation will set up rules and certain probabilities for things to happen, and then let their computers do the rest of the work. Procedural generation has been around in video games for decades — 1984’s Elite used it to create its own (very primitive) galaxy to explore, and ancient UNIX dungeon crawler Rogue used it back in 1980 (in the process spawning an entire genre of games with unique, procedurally generated levels). Most recently, it’s been used to great effect in Spelunky, creating digitally bespoke platforming levels that are maddeningly hard yet always fair.
The benefits of procedural generation are obvious: You can generate enormous amounts of stuff (“assets,” as they’re usually called in video-game development) without any human intervention. The downsides are equally obvious: Without a human at the steering wheel, the only way to control what’s being created is by fine-tuning the rules of procedural generation. And since Murray and his squad have created 18.4 quintillion planets, the best they could hope for were spot checks along the way — no QA tester was going to be able to check 18.4 quintillion planets. A single player visiting a new planet once a second without rest would reach his or her final world a shade under 585 billion years from now. (Our actual, real-life sun will have expanded into a red giant, destroyed Earth and most of the solar system, and then shrunk back down to a white dwarf 579.5 billion years before that.)
So, it’s a big fucking game. But what do you do in it? In practice, it’s a game of exploration and resource collection. You start off with an okay ship and an okay mining laser and an okay spacesuit. Your goal is to get better versions of all of them, mainly so you can have more pockets to carry more stuff, which then lets you get better ships, guns, and spacesuits. In effect, you become something like a space prospector and/or scrap collector, shooting off to some undiscovered planet, seeing if there’s anything that you can mine or take, and then eventually jetting back to a space station to sell your haul. There are very loose game mechanics pushing players toward the Galactic Center, but the game seems fine with you just bopping around, doing as you please. And those core game mechanics — go to new worlds, strip them of their resources, and then rocket off into the next new world — works remarkably well.
Not only is every planet procedurally generated, but every plant and animal is as well. (Per Murray, within the first night of the game’s release, players had already discovered over 10 million species of living things — more than we know about on our own planet.) Sometimes this works out to stunning effect — playing the other night, I came across a herd of giraffe-ish reptiles moving slowly across the landscape, gently lowing to each other. My own little weird Jurassic Park moment. And then sometimes you find this.
And when comparing the game’s prerelease footage to what you actually find, you can see there have been some downgrades on that front as well.

The procedural generation can also be a letdown in some other ways. While the geography of each planet is unique, there’s only a set number of types of planets, so you’ll quickly find yourself on another ice planet, or tropical planet, or rocky moon, but with slightly different ’70s sci-fi Day-Glo colors lighting everything up. After visiting enough planets, they start to blend together. Same ball of rock, different coat of paint.
And, after a while, exploring the planets themselves can become a bit of a grind. There are various ancient monoliths to discover, alien languages to learn, outposts to claim, and wrecked ships to grab for loot or try to fix up. But these events start to repeat themselves pretty quickly. There are small variations written into all of them, but it’s window dressing over the same basic experience. So the player quickly falls into a rhythm: Find the most interesting bit of any planet, usually spottable by doing a quick flyover of the planet; land; grab the loot; and take off for the next world. Try to avoid space pirates while you travel.
You can procedurally generate 18.4 quintillion unique planets, but you can’t procedurally generate 18.4 quintillion unique things to do. No Man’s Sky is a very, very large universe that gives you less to do than something any 10-year-old could put together in a decent afternoon of Minecraft.
Grand Theft Auto III’s smeary graphics and sneering humor haven’t aged well at all, but it crystallized a lot of what would become the open-world genre, and would later result in Red Dead Redemption, one of the best games of the previous generation. I firmly believe that by combining the ability to create vast worlds with relatively little resources, No Man’s Sky is going to result in a new type of game breaking through the mainstream; games where the player largely wanders where they choose, watching as interlocking systems create their own unique moments of game play. In the 20 hours I’ve played No Man’s Sky, I’ve seen exactly one other planet someone else has been on. That means everything else I’ve seen has been something only I have seen, and I likely will be the only person to ever see it.
Which, despite all of that, if you care at all about video games (and maybe even if you don’t), I highly recommend No Man’s Sky. I think a few years from now, No Man’s Sky will be looked back at as the same type of breakthrough game that Grand Theft Auto III was in 2001.
The real bottleneck in video-game creation right now isn’t the technology — it’s that it takes massive teams working together to create anything of real value. A game like this year’s critically acclaimed Uncharted 4 — a beautifully crafted linear game with a smart script and a world where teams of designers carefully placed every piece of fruit, every book, every rock — took well over 200 people to create. Sean Murray and Hello Games created a universe with 16 people.
Murray and the team may have fallen slightly short of the mark on their first shot, but it doesn’t mean they — or another team — won’t find a way to nail it with another go-round. With No Man’s Sky, Murray and his team have proven you can create an entire universe from scratch. The next question is: Can you use that same complicated math to create an entire universe filled with more interesting things than trading posts, loot boxes, and the occasional space pirate?
A series of screenshots uploaded to Imgur details numerous hacking tools acquired by the group, including some that share names with programs detailed in documents leaked by Edward Snowden; names like “BANANAGLEE.”
Over the weekend, a hacker or hackers working under the very subtle name the Shadow Brokers posted supposed evidence that they had compromised servers belonging to the Equation Group, a hacking group long believed to be an offshoot of the National Security Agency.
In a series of tweets, Edward Snowden, who is pretty knowledgable about this sort of thing, said that the binaries were likely left on a malware staging server by “lazy” operatives.
In a missive posted on Pastebin, the group provides a sampling of free files, and offers to auction off more of the tools to the highest bidder. “We auction best files to highest bidder. Auction files better than stuxnet. Auction files better than free files we already give you.” Stuxnet is the virus used to covertly break centrifuges refining nuclear material in Iran.
The group says that if they receive a million Bitcoin (roughly $568 million), they’ll release more free files to everyone. According to The Wall Street Journal, security experts analyzing the files have found them to be legitimate.
He added that sort of infiltration is not new (very encouraging), but the public disclosure of it is.
He further theorized that the release of said tools could have huge implications for U.S. foreign policy should the software be used as conclusive evidence of malware attacks originating from the NSA.
The National Security Agency has, duh, not commented on the reported hack.
We’ve seen viral Olympics moments from impressive wins, and also horses dancing to Santana featuring Rob Thomas, but here’s one from an impressive loss: During a women’s 5,000-meter heat today, New Zealand’s Nikki Hamblin tripped and took Team USA’s Abbey D’Agostino down with her. And in a move so professional and genuine it is warming even my tiny, icy blogger heart, D’Agostino helped her competition back to her feet and told her they had to finish the race. “This is the Olympic Games,” she told Hamblin, according to ESPN. “We have to finish this.”
From there, the two made their way toward the finish line with D’Agostino coming in just behind Hamblin due to an injury sustained from the fall. Fortunately, both women will still be allowed to run in the final later this week. “That girl was the Olympic spirit right there,” Hamblin said after the race. “I am so impressed and inspired by that.” Tears.
What the sale means for the future of Gawker’s blogs — which in addition to the namesake site include Gizmodo, Deadspin, Jezebel, and a growing “deals” business based on e-commerce referrals — is not entirely clear. Gawker used a Section 363 bankruptcy filing, which, as Recode explains, allows the company to accept a bid that might not pay the most money, but will preserve “good” parts of the business. In other words, Gawker struck a deal that preserved the company’s editorial operation.
After being driven into bankruptcy by pro wrestler Hulk Hogan and Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, Gawker Media was acquired today by Univision for $135 million, Recode reports. The sale marks an end to nearly a decade and a half of independent blogging outside of corporate ownership, the influence of which can be felt far and wide across digital media today.
Publisher Ziff Davis set the floor for the auction at $90 million, promising to buy the company if nobody else made an offer. A half dozen or so media companies were rumored to be in the mix. They included Univision, which acquired the Root and the Onion over the past couple of years, and Vox Media, which owns Vox, SB Nation, and the Verge. New York Media, which owns the site you’re currently reading, also reportedly showed interest. According to Bloomberg, only Ziff Davis and Univision submitted bids this week.
The deal has yet to be finalized and is still pending court approval.
Since bursting onto the college-campus scene back in 2013, Yik Yak has struggled to keep up its popularity. Despite successful funding rounds and a killer valuation during its early months, the anonymous app has struggled to keep college kids from jumping ship in favor of other social apps, ones that aren’t anonymous and don’t require a user to be within a certain geographic range to participate. To combat this, Yik Yak is revamping itself (again) and starting today the app will no longer allow any anonymous posts.
Under the new changes, all users will be required to post under a handle with a user profile where they can add photographs and personal information. Yik Yak rolled out an earlier version of this back in March, allowing users to opt to post under handles. That move backfired slightly, given that without any way to prove who was actually behind the handle, users were just as vulnerable to abuse as they were when the app was totally anonymous. (Like handles, profiles were also introduced earlier this year, but now both are mandatory to post.)
It’s hard not to notice the similarities between the new Yik Yak and some of the world’s top social apps. Ephemeral statuses touch on Snapchat; handles and profiles feel a little like Twitter (or even Peach, may it rest in peace); and the local-network vibes could be compared to Swarm, Foursquare, or even Facebook’s “Nearby Friends” feature. Which is probably what Yik Yak is banking on: If these elements are working for other apps, maybe they’ll work for Yik Yak. (Think Instagram Stories copying Snapchat Stories.) Otherwise, the already-disappearing Yak herd might go extinct for good.
Users will now also be able to post a temporary status that disappears after 24 hours. “Share that in 18 characters (no spaces, emojis welcome 🔥 🎶 🍣 ⚽️) and it’ll appear for up to 24 hours on your profile,” the company explains on its blog. With this, the app is getting an explore tab, where users can find out what other Yakkers are up to around the world. The explore tab will also offer a Local Yakkers section, where users can find and message people nearby. “”It’s a richer, more engaging, more personal feed,” Yik Yak co-founder Tyler Droll told the Verge. “There are people behind each and every one of these posts.” (Though as anybody who has ever used Twitter will attest, there is still plenty of room for harassment even on an app that isn’t anonymous.)
A new report from the Pew Research Center published yesterday reveals vast differences in how black and white audiences experience issues concerning race on social media. According to the study, “In general, Americans are much more likely to see posts related to race or race relations than they are to personally post or share race-related content. Even so, roughly four-in-ten social media users indicate that at least a few of the posts they share are related to racial issues.”
First is the filter bubble that users construct for themselves — if you’re white and have mostly white friends, you’ll likely hear and say less about race relations. “[E]ven among black social media users who say they rarely or never discuss race relations or racial inequality,” the report states, “a majority (55%) state that most or some of the posts they see on social media pertain to race or race relations.”
What can be done to bridge this type of divide comes in a variety of forms. For users, it might mean following and friending a more diverse set of people. For tech companies, it might mean making a greater effort to show users things that are new instead of simply things that are familiar. But regardless of where the change happens, it needs to be active, not passive.
Within the findings, however, lie substantial differences. Sixty-eight percent of black users surveyed said that most or some of the social-media content they saw pertained to race, whereas only 35 percent of white respondents said the same. Overall, “Social media users who regularly have conversations about race tend to see and share more race-related content on social networking sites.” This is likely a product of two main factors.
On Twitter, discussion of race tends to follow prominent events like last year’s Charleston church shooting and the deaths of Freddie Gray and Sandra Bland. Current events often drive social-media conversation. Statistically, there is obvious indication that much of the discussion is driven by black users. Use of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag outpaces its counterpart, #AllLivesMatter, eight to one. According to Pew, only 11 percent of tweets using the former do so to criticize the movement.
Second is the algorithmic sorting on sites like Facebook, which serve up what they believe is most relevant to the user. If a user talks about race more or signals interest in posts related to the topic, they’ll see posts about race more often. If they talk about it less, the opposite occurs.
In a welcome turn from its usual discussions of the shortcomings of the female form, Twitter spent the day analyzing the “ideal male body” thanks to a great and weird new meme. And, boy, have I learned a lot about what it means to have a flawless physique as a dude. You can be purple.
Or salty.
Even necrotic.
The seed for this important discourse was planted back in January when conservative radio host Steven Crowder tweeted a picture of Russian MMA fighter Fedor Vladimirovich Emelianenko standing, semi-dressed, next to a dozen kettle bells. Crowder declared Emelianko “the ideal make body.” (Typo, his.) The tweet currently has just 27 retweets. Not exactly “peak performance” for a tweet.
But today, in strange turn of events, people started replying to Crowder’s tweet with their own takes on the ideal male, sorry, the ideal make body. And from there a meme was born.
Actually, you can be any number of things that seem less than conventionally perfect. But hey! If Twitter says this is the ideal male body, who is this blogger to judge.
As with most memes, this one will likely soon run its course and head off to the great meme beyond. But while it’s still hot, we should all appreciate the important lesson these men have taught us: With all these different societal notions of the “ideal body,” it must be really hard to be a man.
Has there ever been a better use for Snapchat? After snagging her fourth gold today in Rio, Simone Biles managed to find a few moments in her busy schedule to spend with Zac Efron. Being that she is a Cool Teen, Biles, of course, documented their interactions on Snapchat. Including the moment where she ever so politely granted Efron the opportunity to kiss her upon her medal-winning, gravity-defying cheek.
“Tell me when it’s going. I don’t know how Snapchat works,” Efron says (in a reminder that it has been a decade since he was a Cool Teen) right before he goes in for the kiss.
The moment, filled with screams and squeals from several off-camera voices, is a lovely throwback to new stories earlier this week about Biles owning a cardboard cutout of Efron, which, she told NBC, she used to kiss on the cheek in her youth and childhood. Except this time, it’s Efron doing the honors.
Congratulation, Zac. Now go brag to all your friends that one of the greatest Olympic athletes in history allowed you to temporarily place your lips upon her skin.
In a statement shortly after news of the sale broke, Gawker CEO Nick Denton said, “I am pleased that our employees are protected and will continue their work under new ownership, disentangled from the legal campaign against the company.” Denton praised Univision as “the leading digital media group for millennial and multicultural audiences.”
This post has been updated with a statement from Nick Denton.
Following a daylong auction yesterday, the groundbreaking blog network Gawker Media, which declared bankruptcy last month, was sold to Univision for the sum of $135 million. The only other bidder was the publishing company Ziff Davis. That Univision, the conglomerate operator of the largest Spanish-language broadcast network in the country, would acquire a famously confrontational (and English-language) collection of upstart blogs seems odd. But it makes sense for Univision — and might be Gawker’s best outcome, too.
Univision doesn’t exactly need Gawker’s income; according to Forbes, its revenue last year was $2.9 billion. But Gawker has been making money in interesting ways that lots of publishers would like to match — in particular, e-commerce, which has grown quickly as a source of revenue for the company during the last several years. In 2014, the company earned $10 million through referral commissions from sites like Amazon for links to products on both its its news sites, and a separate blog called Kinja Deals; now, according to Denton, the Deals division covers all of Gawker’s editorial spending.
Gawker is a profitable and growing business
It’s important to clarify that Gawker’s debts were the result of legal action, not operational dysfunction: Absent a vindictive tech billionaire, the company is profitable. In 2014, Gawker brought in $43.8 million in revenue, a figure that rose to $48.7 million last year and is on track to rise similarly this year (figures according to founder Nick Denton). Univision paying $135 million for a company expected to bring in more than $50 million in revenue this year — that is, in the midst of a major lawsuit and bankruptcy — is, to put it lightly, a very good deal.
Univision wants millennials (and traffic) and has had trouble finding them
Money matters aside, Univision clearly wants to have a digital media presence untethered from its Spanish-language media, if its previous acquisitions are any indication. In May of 2015, it picked up the Root, a website aimed primarily at a black readers. At the beginning of 2016, Univision bought a controlling stake in the Onion, which also runs pop-culture site the A.V. Club and bizarro BuzzFeed parody Clickhole.
Gawker could use the resources
If Univision’s commitment to sinking millions of dollars into Fusion is any indication, Gawker now has a corporate benefactor with deep pockets and a willingness to fund unprofitable ventures. Funding a competitive digital-media company in this environment requires a lot of cash; in particular as advertisers and distribution channels have begun to focus on expensive-to-produce video. Large organizations like BuzzFeed and Vox Media have stabilized themselves by selling stakes to media conglomerates like Comcast and NBCUniversal; HBO is the largest investor in Bill Simmons’s new site the Ringer. From that perspective, the Univision deal looks pretty familiar.
And then, of course, there is Fusion. Originally a collaboration between Univision and Disney meant to reach, uh … millennials(?), the cable network and digital-media operation soon became known for spending large sums to hire away prominent names in media in order to build up an underperforming website and television schedule. Fusion’s lethargic start wasn’t doing it for Disney, so they divested, giving full control over to Univision. By all accounts, it’s still giving Fusion plenty of runway to build … something. Just over half of Gawker’s audience are millennials, according to Digiday, making the acquisition an easy way to boost younger readership.
That being said, Gawker’s coverage of Fusion thus far has been pretty unflattering (headline: “Fusion Is Losing a Shit Ton of Money”), so it’s probably for the best that Univision also agreed to take over Gawker’s lease on its Union Square offices, rather than move them uptown.
Lastly, even if Univision wasn’t a good fit for Gawker, they’d sure as hell be a better fit than other bidder Ziff Davis, which owns PC Magazine, gaming website IGN, AskMen.com, and a whole bunch of other odds and ends, like speedtest.net. Ziff’s portfolio of past and current properties heavily skews towards the dudebro/tech/gamer readership, which would have been bad news for sites like Jezebel, the newly politics-focused Gawker.com, and possibly even Deadspin. Announcing that they had pulled out of the auction, Ziff CEO Vivek Shah stated that “we would have been excited to add Gizmodo, Lifehacker and a few of the other properties to our portfolio.” Ziff was clearly only interested in parts of the company, never the whole thing. With Univision, every Gawker site stands a fighting chance.
Univision is more willing to take risks than Ziff Davis
The internet demands viral videos of national hero Simon Biles, and we stand prepared to deliver. Since the world-historically great gymnast has finished her incredible five-medal run in Rio, let’s look back, at one of the finest moments in her career prior to the 2016 Olympics (and the moment Biles remembered that bees are dying globally at an alarming rate).
Back in 2014, Biles took home the all-around individual gold medal in the World Gymnastics Championships in Nanning, China. (She also won it in 2013 and 2015, because she is a champ.) While she stood atop the podium accepting her win, a bee flew out of her bouquet and directly toward the young gymnast. Like any composed, world-renowned athlete would do, Biles immediately began ducking, running, and hopping on and off the podium while making very tiny “ahhh!” sounds. (Bonus points to her second- and third-place neighbors who seem to be very good sports about the whole thing.)
We’re guessing the bee had no idea who it was messing with; otherwise it would have asked for her autograph.
Green is the word at the Olympics this year. (The color, not to be confused with environmental sustainability.) The hue is everywhere inside the stadiums and arenas in Rio, both in the design aesthetics and on the courts and fields themselves. So it was really only a matter of time before somebody turned the games into a giant green screen.
Update: Well, most Gawker sites stand a fighting chance. CNN’s Tom Kludt is reporting that Univision has three days before the close of sale to decide what to do about Gawker.com, the namesake site that is now considered a toxic brand (granted, a toxic brand that brings in 16 million readers a month). Univision has reportedly agreed to retain 95 percent of Gawker’s staff, so even if the site is shuttered, the employees need somewhere to go — possibly putting their political muscle to work at Fusion. Following the sale, Denton himself is, per The Wall Street Journal, out altogether.
Which is exactly what an Imgur user did using screenshots from Tuesday’s gold-medal men’s singles tennis final between Team Great Britain’s Andy Murray and Argentina’s Juan Martín del Potro.
The dating app started tracking these numbers after it started supporting Giphy within the app earlier this year, Engadget reports. Over 100 million GIFs have been sent since, which means that about 20 percent of all subsequent conversations have contained a GIF or an emoji. Which is good for users, since Tinder also reports that conversations involving GIFs last twice as long as those without.
Murray went on to win the match, though he seemed strangely unaware of the fish swimming around his head, or the fact that he and his opponent were playing in outer space.
If you’re still looking for that perfecting opening GIF, please allow us to suggest this tried and true classic.
If anybody is looking to make this a series, those green gymnastics mats seem like a great next step.
On the heels of announcing Instagram Stories (essentially a carbon copy of Snapchat Stories, just on … Instagram), Instagram announced today that U.S. users are getting a new way to view videos taken from specific events around the world.
Under a new “event channel” on the app’s Explore section, Instagram will feature videos from events like sports games and concerts. (The blog announcing the new feature demonstrates with screenshots of videos of an Adele performance.) But … wait a second. Video shown in real time that gives users an on-the-ground view of an event they otherwise might have missed. Does this sound familiar? Anybody? Good. It should. A big part of Snapchat’s draw is the app’s curated stories, which let users experience everything from smarmy college campus love tales to hard news stories (like the San Bernardino shooting) as they are happening. And now, Instagram seems to be attempting to cash in on that model’s success too. (In fairness, Twitter’s Moments tab is also fairly similar by design.)
The best running jokes on the internet are simple. They’re easy enough to replicate, and getting into them doesn’t require much thought beyond the surface level. (Example: the pure beauty of the bath-bomb meme.) This week, an excellently stupid joke has been making the rounds: old Valentine’s-Day-card standby “Roses are red, violets are blue.”
This morning at Gamescom, the big European video-game conference, publisher Konami announced a new title that fans were simultaneously expecting and dreading: Metal Gear Survive, a sequel/spinoff/side story to Metal Gear Solid V, the latest in the beloved long-running espionage franchise and one of the best games of 2015.
Response to Metal Gear Survive, less than a day out from its announcement, has been, let’s say, tepid. There are a few reasons for this. For one thing, it looks, at best, generic. The type of co-operative, “hold off the zombies” game play depicted in the trailer is rote now, as is the boring, standard, paramilitary cast of characters.
In the prelude to MGS V, the oil-rig base of protagonist Big Boss is attacked and destroyed. In Survive, members of Big Boss’s crew are sucked through a wormhole — stick with me here — into an alternate reality where they must defend themselves against zombies.
Metal Gear Solid V had a protracted, complicated development history that ended with Kojima being forced to ship a game that was not fully realized and often felt rushed and unfinished. Then he was booted from the company entirely. His name was also removed from game’s box art. A small contingent of die-hard fans believe that all of the drama was a hoax, and that the rest of the game is still on the way. Kojima has a long history of screwing with his audience, so this is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. Highly unlikely, sure, but not impossible.
But even setting those issues aside, the main problem with Metal Gear Survive is that it wasn’t created by Hideo Kojima, the longtime mastermind behind the Metal Gear series. Over 30 years, he crafted an epic, problematic, often incoherent, always entertaining saga that asked the important question “What if the U.S. military was anime and fought with giant bipedal robots?”
First-glimpse impressions of Survive indicate that it’s the game equivalent of reheated leftovers. Konami has already said that it won’t retail for $60, the standard price for a major console game (the use of “Metal Gear” but the absence of “Solid” in the title also indicates less-than-flagship status). The game’s description sounds like the developer tweaked some already-existing assets and made do — Konami explicitly describes it as “a new addition to the Metal Gear Solid V experience.” Hell, they might even be working off of a Kojima-authored design document — in 2013, he tweeted the innocuous message, “Want to make a genuine zombie game.”
All of this is to say that there are many reasons to be skeptical of Survive, based on the limited information available. It’s a seminal video-game franchise trying to make do without its driving creative force. It sounds generic and boring. It hardly seems a continuation of the sprawling storyline that players care about.
Much remains to be seen, but the game’s mere existence is a sign that even without Kojima, Konami believes there is more money to be wrung out of Metal Gear. As a first move, Survive isn’t really instilling confidence.
Like anything that’s central to life — food, money, companionship, having at least one binge-able TV show on hand at all times — smartphones get certain myths built up around them. Much like adding olive oil to a pot of boiling pasta (do not add olive oil to a pot of boiling pasta, by the way), we read bad advice, get told things by people we assume we can trust, or just kind of intuitively feel like certain things have got to be true — until we find out we’ve been led astray. Here are some common things you may be doing with your smartphone that are actually kinda dumb. It’s not your fault.
Shutting Down All of the Apps Running in the BackgroundOpen up your phone and it’s entirely possible you can thumb through hundreds of open apps and Google searches (“what day mother’s day 2013 too late?”). Closing all of that extra crap has got to help save battery and speed up your phone, right?
If you want to Marie Kondo your phone’s background apps, feel free — it certainly doesn’t hurt to swipe away that untouched game of Candy Crush from a certain dark period of your life. But it’s not going to give you any extra battery life, or speed up your phone’s performance in any appreciable way. In fact, because your phone will have to restart the app fresh when the siren call of Candy Crush becomes too strong, you may be forcing it to use a little more battery power than needed.
Never Using a Third-Party ChargerWhile it’s true that the charger that came with your phone is probably the best one to use, that doesn’t mean if you lose it you need to shell out $50 for a replacement from the original manufacturer. While it is a good idea to not spend $6 on a cheapo charger from a Chinese manufacturer called something like Kwable Konnext, getting a reliable phone charger from a third party is fine; Belkin or Farbe Technik are both solid choices if find yourself needing to charge up during a long layover at the airport.
Buying a Screen ProtectorThere used to be a good reason to buy a screen protector: Early smartphones used to scratch pretty easily — leave your phone too close to your keys and you’d have a gouge in your screen you’d have to live with until your next upgrade. But starting in 2013, with the third version of Corning’s Gorilla Glass, smartphone screens got a lot harder. Your keys stand no chance against the improved surface. If you’re in the mood to live dangerously, you can actually test this out: Buy a screen protector and scratch away at it with your house keys. Your screen protector will get shredded; your actual phone screen will not. (All this goes out the window, of course, if you’re in the habit of regularly carrying diamonds around in your pocket, which will still scratch up your screen something fierce. Life: It’s a struggle.)
Draining the Battery to Zero As Soon As You Get Your Phone Like the ideas that swimming within an hour of eating means you’ll cramp up and die, sitting too close to the TV will ruin your eyesight, or 9/11 wasn’t an inside job, we’ll probably have this myth with us forever. We will have colonists on Mars, and they will still drain the batteries of their iPhone 47 Mars Edition to zero before recharging them “to make the battery last longer.” The problem is that there is a kernel of truth to this one: Older nickel cadmium or nickel-metal hydride batteries would “forget” what their full capacity was, and draining them to zero was a good way to reset their memory. But unless you’re still sporting a phone from the ’90s, you have a lithium-ion or lithium-ion polymer battery, which needs no calibration. While these batteries will eventually lose their ability to hold a charge (that’s why your four-year-old phone only lasts half a day), it’s actually worse for your phone to drain it all the way to zero and then recharge it. Instead, if you can manage to keep a schedule of regular top-offs on battery power, you’ll keep your battery’s overall storage capacity at its highest.
Being on an “Upgrade” PlanOthers have run the math, but if you absolutely have to have the newest and best phone out there, it’s still likely cheaper to simply handle the process yourself. Particularly with iPhones, which hold their aftermarket value incredibly well, you can buy every new version of the iPhone, use it for a year, sell it, and then buy a new one outright for less than Apple’s upgrade program — including the cost of buying AppleCare+. The only downside, of course, is you need to have the cash up front to buy a new phone in the first place. Meanwhile, most carriers’ “upgrade” plans tend to carry a ton of fine print and can have upgrade periods of 18 months, meaning you may not even be able to swoop up that iPhone 7 at the end of September. Whenever possible, it’s always better to buy your phone outright instead of from a carrier.
Thinking a Massive Battery Alone Will Give You Days Without a ChargeSmartphone processors largely obey Moore’s Law: The number of transistors on a microchip roughly double every 18 months. Batteries simply don’t. Instead, battery power improves by about 5 to 6 percent per year, a glacial pace compared to the exponential growth in processors. Still, many shoppers are at least figuring out what to look for in a phone battery: mAH, or milliamp-hours, a gauge of the maximum charge a battery can hold, which in turn is really just a measure of how big the battery is. But while batteries are getting bigger (Samsung’s Note 7 sports a massive 3,500 mAH battery, and there are phones out there with 4,000 mAH), most of the real improvements to battery life come from software optimization, such as automatically turning off the screen as much as possible. You still want a large battery, but if you’re getting a huge battery from a manufacturer that doesn’t optimize well, size really does not matter.
You’re Avoiding Android Phones Because They’re Full of MalwareThere are plenty of good reasons to not get an Android phone. Many of them come stuffed with bloatware. The highly fractured Android market means that finding the right Android phone can be a headache. With Apple, the answer is easy: Get the newest iPhone. iOS is arguably a more pleasant experience to use overall, and if you’ve been in the iOS system for a while, transferring everything over can be a pain. Most important, the App Store does a better job of vetting everything that comes through, so you don’t have to worry about an app that’ll suddenly start sucking up your battery for no apparent reason, or crash every time you try to open it. Plus, it’s essentially impossible, without jailbreaking your iPhone, to download an application not in the App Store. It’s also true that malware exists for Android phones — it’s just very hard to find in the Google Play Store. There have been exceptions — users were affected by a spyware Trojan horse program in April of this year — but, overall, the only way to really put your phone in danger is by downloading apps from outside the Google Play Store. And in return, you get a phone that you can customize a lot more and is sometimes ahead of the curve technologically; it’s a running joke that Apple will tout new features on the iPhone that Android phones have had for months or even years.
You Think How Many Megapixels Your Phone’s Camera Has MattersBack in the early to mid 2000s, phone companies competed hard to cram as many megapixels into their cameras as possible, and it made sense. The low resolution of many of the cameras then (remember what a RAZR snapshot looked like?) meant that when iPhone 4 came out with a five-megapixel camera compared to the 3GS’s three-megapixel camera, the picture quality was noticeably better and helped apps like Instagram quickly take off. But now even a mid-tier phone is likely sporting a 12-megapixel camera, and it’s easy to find 16- or even 20-megapixel cameras on modern phones. But the phone many consider to take the best pictures, Samsung’s Galaxy 7, sports just 12 megapixels. So does the iPhone 6s. There are plenty of high-end, full-frame DSLR cameras used by pros that don’t tend to go over 20 megapixels. Until either smartphone screens or computer screens take another great leap forward, 12 megapixels will probably suit you fine. What will really determine how good your shot of your feet in the sand will look on Instagram is lens quality, sensor size, and whether you can alter the ISO settings on your phone.
Having a Dark Background or Reading White Text on Black Saves Your BatteryIf you look at what’s using the majority of your battery on your phone, chances are most of your power is being eaten up by just having the screen on. (One of the reasons to try to keep it as dim as possible while still legible.) Surely, if you had a black background, it would use less battery power, right? Not so much. LCD screens, still used in all iPhones and many Android phones, all use a back light to illuminate their screens. Even if your pixels are black, they’re getting the same amount of light shot through them (and using the same amount of battery power) as something pure white or any other color.
This all, changes, however, if you have a phone with an AMOLED screen (don’t worry about what the acronyms mean, just know that it’s a higher-end screen that’s started showing up on Android phones in the past few years). AMOLED screens have a unique feature: They don’t use a back light; they only light up individual pixels. So if a pixel is black, it’s not lighting up at all. So in these cases, a dark background can save you some battery power, and that’s why phones with AMOLED screens often have a power-saving grayscale mode that can radically extend battery life.
Turning Off Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Location Services to Save BatteryYou’ve got 10 percent battery left and miles to go before you sleep. How do you eke out a bit more from your phone? Surprisingly, it’s not by turning off Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Location Services. Sure, don’t suddenly start blasting music to your Bluetooth headphones while using turn-by-turn directions on Google Maps, but just having these features on — while not using any apps that actually use those features — won’t affect your battery life at all.
Not Charging Your Phone Overnight to Avoid “Overcharging” ItYour phone (or laptop, or tablet) is smart enough to know when its battery has reached 100 percent and stop taking in current, so charge away while you sleep without worries of an exploding phone under your pillow. The one thing you may want to consider? Lithium-ion batteries can heat up (that’s why your phone can get so hot when you’re playing a graphically intense game), and if your case doesn’t allow for good airflow, there’s a chance you could heat up your battery, shortening its effective life. So maybe slip your case off before you head to bed.
Thinking That Freezing Your Phone Will Help the BatteryWait, do people really think that putting a phone in the freezer will help its battery life?
Jesus Christ. Don’t put your goddamned phone in the freezer.
When the company rolled out Instagram Stories earlier this summer, Kevin Systrom was not shy about the obvious similarities between the Stories features on the two apps. “This format unlocks a new version of creativity for us,” he told The New York Times. “I think Instagram will be judged by where we go from here, and what we make of it in the future.” Apparently the future is now and it still looks like Snapchat.
Have you recently lost your wallet? Do you live in the Colorado Springs area? Is your wallet made of actual grungy one-dollar bills and held together by clear tape? If you answered yes to all of the above, the Colorado Springs Police Department would like to help reunite you with your lost cash.
According to the CSPD Facebook page, the “very unusual wallet” was turned in recently to the Stetson Hills Division. If that means anything to you, please contact them here about claiming your lost item. And once you do that, please contact me to answer my many burning questions about why you made your DIY wallet with your own money. What inspired you? Would it cost more to just buy a simple wallet? What is your preferred brand of tape? How can I make my own? I think we could have a great Facebook Live segment on our hands here.
Well, not really. Phones aren’t like your old Dell desktop or your current web browser, where leaving a resource-heavy page running in the background can slow your computer to a crawl. An app in the background of your phone is more like a screenshot of what the app was doing the last time you used it. It snaps back to life when you select it, but unless it’s something like Spotify that’s still running in the background, those open windows have no effect on battery life. Think of it this way: What’s the biggest complaint of every smartphone user? Battery life. If running apps in the background truly ruined your phone’s battery, both Apple and Android phones would be shutting them down automatically like it was an episode of 30 Rock.
Usain Bolt has already earned one gold medal and spawned one spectacular photograph in Rio, but with his performance tonight in the men’s 200-meter semifinal, he’s on track to do both again. Bolt took first place in the semifinal, coming in just ahead of Canada’s Andre De Grasse, who took second place, which means they’ll both be moving on to the final. Which is great, but not quite as great as the sweet moment the two pals shared as they crossed the finish line. Which Twitter users immediately picked up on and began to meme.
The relationship between Bolt and De Grasse has been building for some time now, including earlier this week when Bolt won the 100-meter final and seemed just as excited about De Grasse taking the bronze as he was about his own win. The two will compete in the gold-medal final on Thursday night. Just think of the fanfiction opportunities.
The formula for participating is easy. Stanza one: Roses are red. Stanza two: Violets are [word that will rhyme with …]. Stanza three: Screenshot of a ridiculous news headline or YouTube video title.
The “Roses are red” trend has been circulating the internet for years now, dating back to an old Yahoo (RIP) Answers discussion back in 2006 and a Reddit thread in 2012, according to Know Your Meme. But for some reason, Twitter, perhaps bored with the Olympics, decided to modify the gag and bring it back this week. Coincidentally, today’s fake internet holiday du jour is Bad Poetry Day. People are already adding the requisite hashtag (#BadPoetryDay) to their “Roses are red” tweets, and brands have started doing the same.
A reminder: These poems are not meant to be sincere. Please do not use them to express any true emotions or feelings.
Which means it’s only a matter of time before this meme dies at the hands of late capitalism.
Still, we’ll leave you with this final poem.
Beginning this month, Uber will allow customers in Pittsburgh to summon self-driving cars, making it the first tech company to make its fleet of semi-autonomous vehicles available for public consumption. Not even Google, which kicked off the technological wave, has made it this far.
From Bloomberg:
Users will be randomly selected to try autonomous vehicles (and, as an added bonus, those rides will be free). Pittsburgh has long been the test site for Uber’s autonomous division because it is the location of Carnegie Mellon, whose staff of robotics experts was raided by the ride-share company.
By collecting user data since the start of the Games, Tinder was able to round up lists of the sports played by the most-swiped Olympic athletes on the app. For women, the most desirable sport during the Games is table tennis; for men, regular tennis. Rounding out the next four spots for women: field hockey, rowing, weightlifting, rugby, and swimming. Meanwhile, the second through fifth spots for men were weightlifting, gymnastics, sport shooting, judo, and boxing.
Of course, these numbers could also be skewed, since athletes from particular sporting events might not be swiping for hookups, or may have decided to spend their time in Rio focused solely on competition. (Where is the fun in that?) Either way, it’s a great week to be a tennis player.
Of course, Uber wouldn’t frame it like that. The blog post from Otto announcing its acquisition is very careful to explain that what the company does is assist, not replace, truckers. “At Otto, we believe that drivers shouldn’t have to choose between safety and earnings,” they write. “Our self-driving trucks will allow drivers to rest while their truck is moving, and our platform will ensure drivers can easily find loads and are paid fairly.”
This is because trucking is a enormous national industry whose work is performed by heavily fortified union employees. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the country had nearly 1.8 million truckers in 2014 (for comparison’s sake, the BLS reports only 233,700 taxi drivers and chauffeurs for the same period). It’s true: There are many reasons to acquire Otto, and its technology and talent could be enough. But trucking is a multi-billion-dollar industry, and it’s hard not to imagine that Uber — which has used its vast cash reserves to spend its way through regulatory red tape in cities across the globe — is preparing to take on one of the largest job sectors in the country.
The debut of new Uber driver-less cars in Pittsburgh today has been occupying headlines, but another bit of Uber news is likely to be a bigger story in the long run: Uber announced today that it acquired Otto, a start-up working on automated trucking solutions. Otto, composed of ex-employees from prominent companies like Apple, Google, and Tesla, has developed hardware and software that can be mounted onto existing trucks to put them on autopilot (or something like it). In other words: Uber might be about to open up a war on its longest front yet.
Gawker.com, the legendary, pioneering gossip blog and flagship site of Gawker Media, will cease operations next week, following the purchase of the blog network at bankruptcy auction by Univision.
The website’s future has been up in the air ever since the company’s bankruptcy and asset auction were announced, because Gawker.com is the particular website at the center of the Hulk Hogan trial — and the particular target of Facebook billionaire Peter Thiel, who was revealed earlier this year to be funding lawsuits against the company in pursuit of its destruction.
For years, Twitter’s “quality filter,” a feature that attempts to automatically remove threatening, abusive, and repeated tweets from a user’s feed, has been limited only to those with verified accounts — meaning celebrities, journalists, and the Kardashian family at large. But starting today, the company announced, it will be rolling out the feature on a larger scale, allowing all users to turn on the filter.
From Twitter:
The new changes will also allow users to limit their notifications, meaning they’ll only get pop-ups when people they follow on the platform interact with their tweets. (So you’ll no longer have to hear from that guy who begins every reply with “actually,” unless you actively go looking for him.)
Earlier this summer, Twitter also announced it would be allowing people to apply for verification (the little blue check mark you see beside some profiles, denoting an arbitrary level of importance and guaranteeing that the person behind the account is, in fact, who they say they are). It felt, at the time, like Twitter might be moving toward verifying all its users, or working on a similar feature that would answer the harassment cries that have long plagued the microblogging platform. (You can read more about why Twitter should just go ahead and verify all its users here.) Today’s quality-filter and notification changes feel like the logical next step in that progression.
The announcement leaves several questions unanswered. Saying the company will be sifting out tweets based on a “variety of signals, such as account origin and behavior,” doesn’t exactly paint a clear picture of what constitutes a high-quality tweet and what constitutes a low-quality one that will be blocked by the filter. (Online harassment comes in all sorts of creative shapes and sizes these days.) And monitoring and blocking duplicate tweets is a great start at curbing accounts that rack up hundreds of thousands of followers (and subsequently similar numbers in ad revenue) by churning out content cribbed from other Twitter users — but if users don’t opt to use the new filter, these accounts likely won’t suffer. And of course, the real question on all of everyone’s minds: What does this mean for the #brands? (All of these questions are clearly of equal gravity.)
You’ll be pleased to know that the measly previous dancing-robot world record of 540 grooving automatons has been shattered. At a recent beer festival in Shandong, China, 1,007 robots performed a dance that can best be described as Uncles After a Few Too Many, and similar to many drunk dancing uncles, a handful of them fell over halfway through. But the rest performed the 60-second routine in perfect unison.
This post has been updated with additional details.
Over the past two weeks in Rio, we’ve watched as athletes from all over the world have come together for a truly noble cause: memes. Big memes. Small memes. Swimming memes. Running memes. I-don’t-understand-this sport-but-I’m-too-embarrassed-to-say-anything memes. Meme memes.
To help you make sense of them all, Select All has rounded up the cream of the crop from these Olympic Games and devised a very official ranking system to help you know which ones are dank and which ones are just okay. To do this, each meme will be rated using a scale of McKayla Maroneys (the Olympic vaulting champ of London 2012 whose podium “McKayla Maroney is not impressed” scowl is the discerning stuff of legend). The more McKaylas a meme receives, the better it is. So without further ado, please rise:
Simone Biles is an athlete so decorated, so skilled, and so impressive, she even has a move named after her. Dubbed “The Biles” it involves the 19-year-old completing two laid-out backflips with a half twist before landing on two feet and throwing her arms in the air in victory. Or in meme-speak, it involves her leaping into the stratosphere and rotating endlessly in her rightful place among the stars.
The saga of Ryan Lochte, those other tall white swimmer dudes, and the curious case of non-robbery at the gas station at nighttime is a blight on an otherwise spotless week of memes. It bears mentioning here only as a reminder that this behavior, even for all the Twitter jokes it birthed, is bad and should not be repeated.
Rating: 1 out of 10 McKaylas for keeping a straight face while riding a tiny bicycle around and for maintaining excellent posture.
Rating: 2 out of 10 McKaylas for being a gag that works at just about any event except swimming. (Though there was that whole green pool thing, so maybe there is hope.)
Rating: 4 out of 10 McKaylas for safety.
What Gawker was depends a lot on whom you ask, but at the start it was a media-gossip blog; Elizabeth Spiers, its first editor, covered the people and politics of the still-powerful institutions of New York media — Condé Nast and the Times in particular — with equal parts obsession and skepticism. But the “media” qualifier was always secondary to the gossip core. The noblest version of Gawker’s premise was — as its founder, Nick Denton, repeated many times — that the version of a story journalists would tell each other over drinks was always more interesting than whatever was actually in the paper.
Gawker wasn’t the first publication to treat gossip as an intellectual pursuit. But it was the first to do so in the format that now seems completely natural for it: an endlessly scrolling, eternally accessible record of prattle and wit and venom that felt less like a publication than like a place. In this sense, the hook of Nick’s “barroom story” elevator pitch wasn’t the story but the barroom: a loud, sociable space for people to gossip, argue, joke, and whisper, a place where decorum and politeness were not only unnecessary but actively objectionable.
Gawker, and its seven sister sites, had been so successful that we were even looking beyond the blog and into the future with a project Nick had dubbed Kinja. Practically, Kinja was just the proprietary publishing software and commenting system that had been introduced on the blogs in early 2013. But Nick had Facebook-size aspirations for it. In the future, it would be a public platform, designed to give anyone the ability to publish useful information — gossip, news, context — in an infinitely modular format: a stand-alone piece of writing that might also be a comment on another stand-alone post or embedded in a third. Over emails, Nick imagined “at least a decade” of building Kinja — at the end of which, if done right, “we’ll be the ones doing the acquiring.”
By 2015, he had taken to insisting that Gawker, under my editorship, was the meanest it had ever been. He hated one feature called “Baby Name Critic” — a satire of content-farm coverage of celebrity-baby names that took the form of critical evaluations in the style of a book or movie review — so much that he once appeared in the comments fretting that Zoe Saldana’s newborn twins — Cy Aridio and Bowie Ezio — might someday Google themselves and feel wounded that writer Leah Finnegan had called them “hipster scum.”
2. Me
But direction can be hard to determine for the internet. Zoe Saldana’s twins are young, and Leah Finnegan could almost certainly beat them up. On the other hand, Zoe Saldana’s twins have been born into a life of leisure that gives them the means to hire a bodyguard to beat up Leah Finnegan, should they so choose. In which direction was Leah punching? (I mean: Was she even “punching” at Saldana’s kids at all?) The nature of “the platform” has changed, too. If anyone on Twitter or Facebook — or, theoretically, Kinja — can obtain the same-size audience as Gawker, is it fair to say that Gawker is more powerful?
If I was supposed to, as editor-in-chief, determine the direction of the many vectors of power, I failed. I liked critical Gawker; I liked the idea of an internetwide alt-weekly bent on criticizing the powerful in as colorful terms as possible. This felt especially true since the rise of venture-funded sites like Vox and BuzzFeed had brought about an era of safe, deferential internet writing, against which Gawker’s (still fairly infrequent!) spite seemed — internally, at least — like a moral necessity. If this was an overdramatic, Manichaean understanding of the world, well, then it was all the more Gawkeresque.
The debate at Gawker wasn’t just about the allowable degree of meanness; it was about what constituted meanness to begin with. To the general public, to say Gawker was “mean” often meant not just that it was petty or disrespectful but that it was unfairly invasive — such as Gawker’s reporting that Fox News anchor Shep Smith was gay and dating a younger co-worker. But Nick never thought of the publication of details about the private lives of public subjects as “mean”; in fact, he largely saw it as noble. “Every infringement of privacy is sort of liberating,” he told a Playboy interviewer in 2014.
So I resisted at length, and I think justifiably, Nick’s pressure, which was easy enough since Nick knew he had encouraged his writers’ and editors’ independence for too long to bring them to heel now.
It should be said that Gawker in 2015 really wasn’t very mean. The vast majority of what we published was opaque or weird or stupid. But bluntness and meanness are so rare that they stick in the minds of readers. Between its infrequency and Nick’s pressure, “meanness” took on an outsize­importance — an endangered legacy we felt compelled to protect.
That editorial independence was an important component of what set Gawker apart, but it created a culture in which we were often writing as much for each other, in endless cycles of one-upsmanship and self-reference, as for an actual audience. This is a familiar dynamic in web publishing. Enough dismissive or hateful comment threads, enough disingenuous or overstated outrage, enough undermining emails from an imperious and often humorless boss, and you begin to feel like the only people who really get what you’re doing are your co-workers.
Which is in part why when a tip dropped into our laps that a married (to a woman) C-suite executive at a prominent media company had attempted to set up an assignation with a Chicago rentboy, I jumped at it. Here was an Old Gawker story of the kind Nick had once defended: the sexual foibles of a powerful executive and member of a ruling-class family. It would be nice to say that I struggled with the ethics of publishing the story, or that, even better, my maniacal and sociopathic boss pressured me into publishing it. But there was very little question in my mind: It seemed so naturally a Gawker story that I assigned it immediately.
Whatever we’d hoped to accomplish with that story, we instead reaffirmed the world’s understanding of what we were: needlessly cruel. Within a week of publication, Nick was promising in interviews a “20 percent nicer” version of Gawker. In November, he announced in a memo that Gawker would shift from general gossip and tabloid news to “political news, commentary and satire.”* The tide of public opinion had changed, and Gawker’s mischievous gossip was no longer a guilty pleasure. It was a problem.
I could construct (and, during the past year, often have, over sheepish drinks with disappointed or angry colleagues) an elaborate house of rationalization, wings upon wings of explanation about the value of transparency, the democratic significance of holding nothing back. But ultimately we’d put to work a tactic best used to shame homophobic politicians against a guy whose only real crime was being a member of our abstract notion of the enemy class. We hadn’t exposed any great hypocrisy; instead, we’d taken a bit of gossip and brought the full bludgeoning of moral urgency and ideological commitments to bear on it.
Much of that (somewhat unnerving) sense of stability in 2014 could be chalked up, surprisingly, to Nick. A tall, imposing Brit with an intimidating tolerance for awkward pauses and an unquenchable thirst for gossip, Nick Denton had long maintained a reputation as a villain in New York media circles, a dark prophet who had appeared at the twilight of journalism to reveal a new path. He’d arrived in New York City in 2002 after stints as a financial journalist and tech founder, carrying with him the British reporter’s disdain for propriety and the Silicon Valley entrepreneur’s contempt for rules. He took a small dot-com fortune made from a tech meetup site and used it to fund payments — $1,000 a month — for writers at two blogs. One was Gizmodo, a digital Wired focused entirely on consumable electronic gadgets. The other was Gawker.
Within two years, Kinja would be abandoned, along with Nick’s world-­conquering ambitions, and ultimately the entire company would declare bankruptcy and be sold at auction to the media conglomerate Univision for $135 million. Gawker Media will likely turn out to be a good investment. Its six other sites — Gizmodo (tech), Jezebel (women), Deadspin (sports), Lifehacker (life-hacking), Kotaku (video games), and Jalopnik (cars) — are large and widely popular. (An eighth site, io9, covering “the future,” had already been folded into Gizmodo.) The parent company is on pace to earn more than $50 million in revenue this year. As much as a third of that revenue comes from the lucrative e-commerce department, which makes money from links to Amazon and other retailers.
But Gawker itself was deemed too toxic to keep open. Within days of the sale, Univision announced it would shut down the site. It makes sense; no sane corporate owner would ever give Gawker the same kind of long leash that it had under Nick. And without that absolute editorial freedom —especially the freedom to shoot itself in the foot, while its foot is in its mouth — there is no Gawker. Gawker had “died” a dozen times before. But it’s never died like this.
The question remains, who killed it?
1. Nick Denton
3. Gamergate
Of course, “public opinion” online is hard to gauge, since it tends to be determined by the loudest and most persistent voices. If you can mobilize and engage even a fairly small number of people, you can create an impression of enough outrage to destabilize a business. As Gawker was imploding in the summer of 2015, a group of teenage ­video-game enthusiasts was throwing gasoline on the already-raging fire. These were the Gamergaters.
More problematically, it would turn out, I was also, unconsciously, messing with the only group even less able to grapple with irony or context: brands. What I’d missed about Gamergate was that they were gamers — they had spent years developing a tolerance for highly repetitive tasks. Like, say, contacting major advertisers.
That fall, Gamergate began waging a hugely annoying, and sometimes genuinely menacing, war against Kotaku. I personally came to the attention of Gamergate in October 2014, not for a fearless act of journalism, but because I was messing around on Twitter and I stepped in it. Sam Biddle, one of Gawker’s best and most notoriously aggressive writers, had tweeted that the lesson of Gamergate was that nerds should be bullied into submission; this in turn led to a flood of tweets and emails to me demanding that he be disciplined; I responded in a mode that seemed appropriate: I goaded and dismissed and largely treated the people complaining with a great deal of contempt and flippancy.
And so Gawker went into full-on crisis mode. Our chief revenue officer flew to Chicago to meet shaky clients; someone I hadn’t spoken with since high school Facebook-messaged me to let me know that her employer, L.L.Bean, a Gawker advertiser, was considering pulling its ads. Nick asked me to draft a non-apology apology — a clarification, basically, that we did not, institutionally, support bullying. Sam was compelled to tweet an apology. Joel, then the executive editor, published on Gawker, over the objections of the editors, another clarification. I then published, without Joel’s knowledge, an apology for the apology. Perhaps tellingly, it was the first time I’d ever really been confronted with the business side of Gawker besides small talk at parties.
On Reddit, a campaign was launched to contact every advertiser Gamergaters could find on Gawker’s site — and not just the marketing departments of advertisers like Adobe and BMW, but specific executives. If you can bug a chief marketing officer, it doesn’t matter that your complaints are disingenuous: He just wants to stop being annoyed.
In retrospect: This was extremely stupid. Even in 2014, Twitter had already become a mechanism by which indiscreet people lost their jobs. Still, it was very difficult for me to believe that anyone genuinely thought that “pro-bullying” is a stance that anyone has ever adopted, or that Sam Biddle’s tweet was a statement in support of bullying. But what I believed, or didn’t believe, didn’t matter. I wasn’t messing around with irony-fluent trolls but with teenagers and college students who seemed unable or unwilling to understand context or sarcasm — exactly the kind of people who might actually believe that Sam Biddle would get a raise for bullying gamers (a myth that still floats around the various Gamergate communities).
Of all the enemies Gawker had made over the years — in New York media, in Silicon Valley, in Hollywood — none were more effective than the Gamergaters. Gamergate, a leaderless online movement dedicated to enforcing its own unique vision of “ethics in journalism,” had first taken up with Gawker Media the summer before, in 2014. Earlier that year, a writer for Kotaku had had a brief fling with a well-known video-game developer. In August, the developer’s ex-boyfriend, a 24-year-old computer programmer, wrote a 10,000-word blog post about her, spawning rumors that she’d traded sex for a positive review of her game on Kotaku. That no such review ever actually appeared on the site should tell you a lot about Gamergate’s relationship to the truth; that Gamergaters believe this is how sex works should tell you a lot about the Gamergate demographic. But none of the specifics of the story really mattered, because ultimately Kotaku was being targeted less for specific ethical violations than for its critical coverage of the portrayal of women and minorities in video games and the sexism of the gaming community. The teenagers behind Gamergate were young, obsessive, deeply resentful of women, and had no sense of social boundaries, and now they finally had a rallying cry —“Ethics in journalism!” — and a common enemy — or, really, enemies, among them the developer in question, Zoe Quinn, and feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian, who became the object of both sustained harassment and violent threats.
Then it all went away. Gawker had taken a hit — thousands of dollars of advertising gone, at least. But in the weeks we’d been hemorrhaging advertisers and goodwill, stories in the New York Times and other outlets — the real media—and a segment on The Colbert Report made it clear that the Gamergaters were the bad guys in this case, not us. The sites went back to normal.
But of course it didn’t go away. Gamergate proved the power of well-organized reactionaries to threaten Gawker’s well-being. And when Gawker really went too far — far enough that even our regular defenders in the media wouldn’t step up to speak for us — Gamergate was there, in the background, turning every crisis up a notch or two and making continued existence impossible.
4. A.J. Daulerio
That the financial pressure had reached the limits of bearability was in large part because looming on the horizon was an enormous and costly lawsuit, one that Gawker expected to win even as it was being thwarted at every turn.
Hogan sued Gawker, Nick, A.J., Clem, and the Love Sponge, who’d recorded the tape himself. (Bubba initially claimed that Hogan had been aware he was being recorded but insisted he wasn’t the person who’d leaked it.) The judge who took up the case in 2013 ordered Gawker to remove the post. Gawker, citing the First Amendment, declined, though it did take down the video itself, and in March 2016, four years after the original post had been published, the suit moved to trial in front of a Florida jury.
The trial was a disaster, not least because of A.J. himself. A deposition recorded in 2013, when it still seemed likely that the suit would end in a settlement, featured a damaging exchange in which a lawyer for the plaintiff pushed A.J. about the lines Gawker would or would not cross, asking: “Can you imagine a situation where a celebrity sex tape would not be newsworthy?” “If they were a child,” A.J. says. “Under what age?” the lawyer asks, a dumb question that deserved a more serious answer than A.J.’s flippant response: “Four.” The jury ruled in favor of Hogan, awarding him $140 million. A.J. was held personally liable for $100,000. His net worth was calculated to be -$27,000.
A.J. is now thought of as the guy who revealed the sociopathy at the heart of Gawker — but I mostly remember him as a great boss. Deadspin, the site he ran, was funny and weird and smart. It seemed to hit perfectly that characteristically Gawker balance between high- and gutter-mindedness. He’d turned what could have been a boringly sordid story about the Jets’ then-quarterback Brett Favre’s allegedly sending dick pics to a Jets female employee into an entertaining, multi-post saga in which A.J. was a main character and which included publishing the pics themselves — in the process burning his source and paying money for material. It was reckless and stupid and useless and thrilling, and it also raised a real concern about a famous football player sexually harassing women. This was what Gawker was supposed to be doing, right? Not just juicy, populist, tabloid stories —juicy, populist, tabloid stories with panache, and a point.
This was A.J.’s role, as much as anything: to be the Gawker about which people told tall tales. But he also recognized talent and encouraged it to succeed; he hired and put in positions of responsibility more women and people of color than any editor before or since. Instead of asking a diverse array of writers to meet similar traffic goals, he treated traffic like its own particular beat and hired a writer, Neetzan Zimmerman, to cover that beat, seeking out and writing up the highly viral content that would help the site reach its monthly targets while other writers pursued their weird interests at their own speeds. He understood his job as assembling a team of writers he loved to read and giving them the cover to pursue their ambitions.
The problem for A.J. is that at Gawker, “cover” often meant being scummy and reckless so the staff wouldn’t have to be. He’d already demonstrated a willingness to cross lines of taste and ethics at Deadspin, most notoriously when he posted a video of a drunk woman having sex in a bathroom stall and stonewalled her requests to remove it (he ended up taking it down the next day; he later told GQ he regretted publishing it). At Gawker, he left the traffic obligations to Neetzan and the day-to-day editorial operations to his gifted junior editors, 24-year-old Emma Carmichael and 25-year-old Leah Beckmann. (This was a familiar dynamic at Gawker, where male employees were generally encouraged to be impulsive and reckless, while female employees were expected to pick up the actual work of maintaining a continuously operating website.) Meanwhile, A.J. continued to fulfill the pushing-the-boundaries obligations. When Nick asked him why he wouldn’t publish whatever recent rumor Nick had heard about a celebrity being gay — a common entreaty to Gawker editors — A.J. introduced a sarcastic column called “Gay or Not Gay?” under his byline. And when a Hulk Hogan sex tape landed in A.J.’s lap, A.J. published it, because that was the cost of doing business.
In 2012, A. J. Daulerio, then the editor-in-chief of Gawker, published an article with the unwieldy title “Even for a Minute, Watching Hulk Hogan Have Sex in a Canopy Bed Is Not Safe for Work but Watch It Anyway.” At the top of the post was a grainy, 101-second video of the wrestler Hulk Hogan with Heather Clem, the wife of his friend Bubba the Love Sponge, a Florida radio personality. Nine seconds of the video featured actual sex; the bulk showed Hogan and Clem engaged in small talk after the act.
And then the cost of doing business turned out to be $140 million.
5. Peter Thiel
Among the most frustrating things about the Hogan lawsuit, as it slowly marched toward trial, was that no one who hadn’t worked for Gawker seemed to have any sympathy for the company. Many people had adopted the line that the post itself, despite having passed with little comment in 2012, was a bridge too far — “revenge porn” of the kind that had ruined the lives of people who weren’t professional wrestlers. But the specifics of the post were ultimately irrelevant; it had become a stand-in for whatever past sin had most offended you. Gawker once unforgivably outed a little-known media executive, or was cruel to me or one of my friends, or was a white-guilt propaganda outlet dedicated to the destruction of gamers; for this, it deserved to suffer. If Hogan was the agent of that suffering, so be it.
Thiel is, by most accounts, remarkably similar to Nick: a gay European immigrant; a conservative libertarian; a future-­obsessed, cerebral visionary prone to conversational awkwardness. They ran in similar circles in the Bay Area in the early aughts. The year Nick moved to New York, Thiel sold PayPal to eBay for $1.5 billion and soon after invested $500,000 in Facebook. Three years later, in 2007, Owen Thomas, blogging for a now-defunct Gawker site, Valleywag, wrote a post called “Peter Thiel Is Totally Gay, People.”
It’s a largely compassionate post. Thomas, who is gay himself, writes about the unspoken bigotries of California venture capital that, he speculates, led Thiel and his friends to rarely discuss his sexuality, and makes a case that expanding the circles to which Thiel was out is a social good, that “it’s important to say this: Peter Thiel, the smartest VC in the world, is gay.”
But the Hogan case was weird. In most lawsuits like this, where the defendants have a strong free-speech case and a payout is far from guaranteed, plaintiffs are looking to come to a settlement: a decent-size sum and the removal of the offending post. But Gawker and Hogan couldn’t, or wouldn’t, come to an agreement. It’s possible Hogan was willing to face a jury because he’d managed to get the case tried in his hometown, where he enjoyed status as a local hero. Or maybe he was willing (or obligated) to risk trial because someone else was bankrolling his legal team. By the time speculation that Hogan’s persistence could be chalked up to an outside backer began to circulate at Gawker, I was gone; I heard later that the first guess was the Church of Scientology. But by this past winter, there was only one real suspect: Peter Thiel.
Thiel evidently didn’t agree. Soon after the judgment, Thiel admitted to the Times that he was behind the lawsuit, which he described as “less about revenge and more about specific deterrence” against Gawker’s “bullying.” The revelation that Thiel had been the agent of so much of Gawker’s humbling was grimly satisfying; at least Gawker’s downfall wasn’t just the result of its own recklessness — it was also due to the efforts of a flatteringly devoted enemy. But knowledge of Thiel’s identity had no effect on the result. It was like an episode of Scooby-Doo where the old man disguised as a ghost still gets away with it.
6. The Internet
Not so long ago, it was actually sort of okay to publish a short excerpt from a celebrity’s sex tape to your otherwise mainstream gossip blog. “Okay” is relative here, of course. There were certainly people in 2012 who thought A.J.’s post a gross violation of Hogan’s privacy. Still, the extent of mainstream condemnation was cheeky expressions of disgust — physical, not moral. The Times devoted an item to the post, quoting tweets from Bill Maher and Zach Braff.
In mid-August, the bankruptcy auction looming, Nick threw a party at the still-newish Fifth Avenue offices. The party was called “Against All Odds” — referring, presumably, to the 14 years of Gawker Media’s success, not its fiery and dramatic downfall, which I think most of us in attendance had imagined was inevitable. An hour or so into it, Nick took the floor to give remarks to a crowd of current and former Gawker Media editors, writers, coders, sellers, ­hangers-on, and subjects. “The fact that we’re here is a freakin’ miracle,” he said, as a Gamergate prankster who’d been denied entry heckled him from near the entrance.
But what has changed isn’t just the outer boundary of what’s appropriate to publish, but where it can be published. Gawker’s biggest mistake in a way was that it had failed to realize that it was no longer the bottom-feeder of the media ecosystem. Twitter and Reddit and a dozen other social networks and hosting platforms have out-Gawkered Gawker in their low thresholds for publishing and disregard for traditional standards, and, even more important, they distribute liability: There are no bylines, no editors, no institution taking moral responsibility for their content. Or, for that matter, legal responsibility — U.S. law protects social networks from liability for the content posted by individual users. These sites had hollowed out a space below Gawker just as Gawker, with great reluctance, had become a real media outlet, one large, rich, and slow-footed enough to be held to account — and taken down.
The total cost of the party was $1,000, its price having been litigated in bankruptcy court; the beer and wine ran out even before Nick had taken the floor. At some point, Emma, now the editor-in-chief of Jezebel, slipped away to pick up some cases of beer, and some of us made our way to the third floor to sit on winding couches and rolling office chairs. Two onetime Gawker writers undertook a shotgun race with cans of Budweiser; some developers played Jenga. Eventually, a few dozen people stumbled out and into cabs for some late, drunk, terrible karaoke. A week later, Nick would call a meeting with the staff of Gawker.com to tell them that the website would be shutting down. But most of them had already heard the news. They’d found out just before, on Twitter.
What was okay (if naughty) in 2012 is, in 2016, regarded as indefensible. The reaction to the enormous judgment against Gawker makes it clear where public opinion now lies: in sharp if muddled defense of privacy rights, even for public figures.
This article appears in the August 22, 2016 issue of New York Magazine.
While Donald Trump pleads with Russia to hack Hillary Clinton’s email accounts, the GOP candidate narrowly avoided his own cybersecurity fiasco. As engineer Shu Uesugi pointed out, Trump’s donation page was susceptible to an injection attack (until yesterday; Uesugi’s post brought about a quick fix).
What he discovered was that on the donation page Trump’s site was loading an external JavaScript file from a GitHub repository. In layman’s terms, it was requesting and running code that was authored and stored on servers that didn’t belong to the Trump web operation.
Generally speaking, this is not a worrisome practice. Calling external files happens often on the web. In fact, it’s often preferred. For example, rather than hosting and loading fonts yourself, you can just request them from Google, saving yourself bandwidth costs and shortening load times. Loading jQuery, a popular variant of JavaScript, is often performed the same way. It can also backfire, like during this past spring when a deleted Node.js package used by some of the biggest websites caused thousands of sites to malfunction.
There is not much hazard in this. Google and jQuery are large projects whose stability can be relied upon. The problem with Trump’s website was that it was calling a JavaScript file from Github, a leading version-control service. It allows developers to iterate on their programs, saving snapshots of code as work progresses. More importantly, because of how git, the program at the heart of Github, works, it allows other users to submit changes to projects.
This is known as a pull request. If somebody makes changes to a project, they can submit a request to that project’s owner, asking the owner to “pull” their changes into the main branch. So if someone wanted to mess with Trump’s site, all they’d need to do is submit a pull request to the Github repository, and have it be accepted. In fact, after the exploit was publicized, someone submitted an “URGENT FIX” which would have changed the background of the page to an image of Trump and Putin making out. In the grand scheme of possible hacks, that’s not so bad.
This article has been corrected to show that a memo from Nick Denton about Gawker’s shift in coverage went out in November, not October.
Someone finally invented a tape-less tape measure that seems cool enough to make you want to measure everything in sight. Or, at least, up to 16 feet away. Because that’s how far it can measure using its special ultrasonic sensor. Well, isn’t that fancy.
Most college kids leave their family pets behind when they pack up their books, bedding, and Pink Floyd The Dark Side of the Moon poster and head off to college. But not Jake Ostrowski. When the 19-year-old moves into his dorm room at Texas Tech this fall, his dog, Jesse, is coming along with him. Well, sort of.
After Jake mentioned how much he was going to miss the 4-year-old golden retriever when he went to school, his mom, Sharla, got an idea. If Jake couldn’t take the real Jesse to college, she’d give him the next best thing: a life-size cardboard cutout of him.
“She brought it home yesterday,” Jake told me via Twitter DM. “It was probably the best gift I’ve ever received.” Jake said he’ll have one roommate at college, but hasn’t yet told him about the third, canine roommate he’ll be bringing along. Since sharing a picture of the two Jesses on Twitter, Jake has seen nearly 2,000 retweets and counting. “I’ve had tons of people quoting the tweet saying that they’re gonna do this now or telling their own mom to take note,” he explained.
As for leaving his real dog behind, Jake says he’s going to miss having Jesse snuggled up in his bed every night. “He’s perfect,” Jake said. Which may or may not have been prompted by me type-screaming “SUCH A GOOD DOG” when Jake sent me the following picture.
SUCH A GOOD DOG.
There are two main ways of looking at this. The first is that Lyft is looking for an escape hatch, that they’re looking to throw in the towel and are ceding the territory to Uber. Lyft currently has a valuation of $5.5 billion, while Uber’s dwarfs it at more than $62 billion. Lyft brings in $400 million in annual revenue, according to the Times, and is not yet profitable. One couldn’t be faulted for crunching those numbers and seeing an already-clear winner.
Lyft, the company that is like Uber but is not Uber, is reportedly looking for a buyer. According to the New York Times, Lyft has talked with many large and varied potential corporate overlords “including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing,” with the GM talks being the most significant.
The reasoning I’m more susceptible to, however, is that Lyft is looking for technology partners to battle Uber in the next phase of the ride-share wars: automation. Uber is already bringing its driverless vehicles to market, and if the pace of innovation continues at its current rate, or even ramps up, Lyft is going to need to find a way to compete. GM and Google are working on driverless cars, and Apple is rumored to be working on something car-related. Lyft is already partnering with GM to test autonomous vehicles. A more permanent combination of car development and ride-share infrastructure wouldn’t be out of the question.
If you are the kind of person who only visits the Met for the Arms and Armor wing, this is … amazing. Totally Accurate Battle Simulator isn’t available to purchase yet, but previews have been released to some video-game streamers, and YouTube videos of the game, in which Gumby-ish soldiers murder and die in a pretty-dang-good approximation of real-world physics, have been popping up everywhere. So I was pretty amped when the the preview code for Totally Accurate Battle Simulator showed up in my inbox, and set about making battles immediately. For example, in this battle I set up a mixture of ballista, catapults, chariots, and spearmen and footmen:
In an email with one of the game developers, Petter Henriksson, he wrote that the game “was made during a game jam that took place at a castle in a really small town in Sweden. We went there mostly to have fun, drink some, and make games, and ended up blowing up YouTube.”
First, I asked the game to settle the upcoming presidential election, by arranging the blue army so it spelled out “HILLARY” in sword-wielding supporters, who marched on a column of Trump supporters also arranged in letter formation and armed with shields. (I gave “Trump” an added “!” to even up the numbers, and also just because I think he’d appreciate it in general.)
As the Prussian military genius Carl von Clausewitz once said, “War is the continuation of politics by other means.” To slightly twist and expand von Clausewitz’s aphorism: What if simulated war could be the simulation of reality by other means? Everything from the microwave to Super Glue was invented on accident; had Henriksson and company stumbled across a way to answer some of life’s most pressing questions?
The results are decisive. You can clearly see how Trump’s main base (the red army) stays together — they waver very little headed into battle with Hillary — a clear parallel with Trump’s own historic march to victory in the primaries. Meanwhile, Hillary’s main forces splinter out into several groups during the initial charge — obviously a symbol for Bernie Bros — but ultimately coalesce. While Trump’s ground game disintegrates, Hillary supporters slowly form up into kill teams to dispatch the last of the Trump supporters, cutting them down from behind. The latest poll numbers seem to support this outcome.
I enjoyed the “Battle Simulator” part of Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, but it was the “Totally Accurate” part that had me more intrigued. The meat of the game is setting up sandbox battles between different military units, and then seeing what happens. The game … could it actually be totally accurate?
Curious, I turned my attention to the other great debate of this summer: Harambe. Should the Zoo Man have shot Harambe? I lined up Zoo Man’s supporters (in red) with muskets and gave Harambe’s blue-tinted supporters boxing gloves, and then let slip the gorillas of war.
Many of the Zoo Man’s supporters end up shooting their compatriots in the head, allowing Harambe’s army to break through until it’s all over but for the weeping. One lonely zookeeper holds out to the south, trying to get off a final shot, but is quickly swarmed. RIP, Harambe — your life may have been cut short too soon, but at least in Totally Accurate Battle Simulator your cause was proven just and you were avenged. This proves that not only can Totally Accurate Battle Simulator accurately forecast real-world events; it can also make moral judgments about them.
I decided to look at media for my next experiment. I ran most of these simulations before Select All editor Max Read admitted to killing Gawker here in the pages of New York Magazine. Before that confession, the main culprit in the demise of the 14-year-old site seemed to be billionaire VC Peter Thiel. Could a column of Gawker shield-bearers (the blue army) somehow stand up to the onslaught of Peter Thiel’s vast sums of money and lawsuits (in this case, represented by red guys on chariots)?
In short: no. Not even close. In fact, the violence of Thiel’s forces destroying Gawker actually sends some of his own men flying hundreds of feet into the air; perhaps a symbol of some of the time and effort Thiel spent destroying Gawker. In the end, one Gawker editor is left cringing as Thiel’s chariots circle him. The editor’s death is quick and sad and unremarkable.
But so far I had been focusing on larger issues, issues frankly far away from my quotidian existence. What if the real battles that needed to be fought were within me?
The Bitcoin army in red makes short work of the sensible investment plan, so my path was clear. Cryptocurrency, here I come. I just hope my local bodega accepts BTC.
But the financial worries were not the only part of my inner struggle. This is difficult for me to write about, and not something I often talk about in public, but I often feel like there are two parts of my brain. There is a part that is genuinely happy most of the time — the part that suddenly smiles at the flash of sunset across the city as I ride my bike through the streets, that delights in the company of my friends and family, that takes great comfort in coming home to my wife every night. But I also carry, as the poet Mary Oliver put it, “the thorn / that is heavier than lead” — not a feeling of pain, exactly, but the feeling that simply existing is sometimes untenable, that there’s a certain faithless emptiness at the core of everything we say and do, that we are all irredeemable people in an irredeemable world. So I figured the only way to resolve these two sides of myself was a game in pre-alpha created by some Swedes over a weekend. The red army would represent happiness, the blue army, would, fittingly, represent sadness.
The contest wasn’t even close. Despite the sadness army repeatedly stabbing their friends in the back, and many of them simply leaving their pitchforks behind before rushing into battle, the happiness army was simply overwhelmed, their final member desperately climbing a pile of corpses before being pulled down by depression. I cracked a bottle of gin, ordered up some Seamless, queued up Rabbit Proof Fence, and prepared to really sink into myself for a while.
But wait, I thought. Sure, Totally Accurate Battle Simulator had been able to forecast the presidential election, assign blame in the case of Harambe, and convince me to buy tens of thousands of dollars of Bitcoins. But I had failed to ask the most important question yet: Was using Totally Accurate Battle Simulator as a proxy for questions both big and small a good idea? Yes (red)? Or no (blue)?
At the end of the battle, you see the two final surviving warriors representing yes and no clambering over a pile of corpses, swords desperately swinging at each other. They both swing, and both fall dead. But apparently one of the soldiers died slightly faster than the other, and the game awards the final victory to the blue army.
I had confirmation: I had not found a suitable way to answer all of life’s questions through simulated battle. As I stared at the corpses littering the field in Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, I thought of the Bertrand Russell quote: “War does not determine who is right — only who is left.”
That said, the game is very much in pre-alpha, so there’s still plenty of time for the devs to work on it some more, add in a few new units, maybe some new battlefields, and turn it into an oracle able to take the measure both of your future and your own internal Weltschmerz.
Last night, the 2016 Olympics wound down at the Closing Ceremonies in Rio. Tonga’s greasy flag bearer made a reappearance and elite athletes from all over the world stopped in their tracks to take selfies with 19-year-old gymnast Simone Biles. It looked like fun.
Like anyone of a certain age, I’ve begun to worry more and more about how to both have a nest egg for retirement while also achieving my financial goals. There seems, in my mind, to be really only two options: invest the maximum amount allowed into a 401(k) plan, with the leftover income going into Vanguard mutual funds, or take all my liquid wealth and turn it into Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that can fluctuate by hundreds of dollars within a month. Both have their appeal: One promises stability, the other promises a community of people who could teach me how to vape. But how to choose? There was only one choice: Totally Accurate Battle Simulator.
Totally Accurate Battle Simulator is, more or less, what it sounds like: a sandbox in which you can set up simulated battles between two armies, using a mixture of units, from unarmed peasants to rock-flinging catapults, all rendered in charmingly blocky 3-D animation. Once you have your simulation set up, you hit “play,” and move your camera around the battlefield, as you watch the battle unfold.
If you want to sign up for the alpha, which hasn’t been released to the public yet, the sign-up is over here at Landfall Games. They also have a game called Clustertruck, available now, which looks pretty good as well, though no word if it’ll help you figure out how to put kids through college.
But the show-stealing moment came toward the end when Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appeared in the stadium at the end of a promo video for the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics. In the video, Abe is shown driving through Tokyo and worrying he’s not going to make it to Rio in time for the closing ceremonies. Instead, he magically transforms himself into Super Mario and, in the style of the game, hops into a warp pipe that brings him straight from Toyko to Rio. (Props to whoever came up with Mario holding up a map that reads “RIO” until he unfolds it and you can see it actually reads “MARIO.” Great stuff.)
Meanwhile, in the Maracanã Stadium in Rio, an oversized warp pipe appeared from the ground and out of it popped Abe complete with Mario’s hat and overalls.
Now we just have to wait another four years. Until then, here’s a hamster playing IRL Super Mario to tide you over.
Of all of the memes this summer, nothing has had staying power like Harambe, a refracted version of online-outrage culture that has gone to some absurd places. Online petitions, parody song lyrics, maudlin music video tributes. But while some see Harambe as fun and games, the staff at the Cincinnati Zoo does not.
The Associated Press reports:
And all of this is kind of the point of Harambe jokes. It’s pushing animal activism past its breaking point, into absurdity. By asking memers and trolls to stop, the zoo is inversely encouraging them to keep going. Harambe memes might eventually die, but they can’t be killed.
Petitions calling for Harambe tributes like renaming the Cincinnati Bengals and adding Harambe to the next Pokémon game are abundant online. On social media in particular, though, commenters have flooded the zoo’s comment section with Harambe mentions.
Over the weekend, New York Times public editor Liz Spayd articulated a point that many have realized but few are willing to admit: Those Facebook Live videos that Facebook is paying media companies to create kinda, well, suck.
Formats aside, Spayd writes that the Times’ efforts have been plagued with technical issues, some of which might be on their end, some of which might be on Facebook’s. The service only opened up its Live API to sources besides its mobile app this past spring.
In the background of Spayd’s specific complaint is a tension common to news organizations, which receive financial compensation from Facebook for producing these live videos and experimenting with the format, but in doing so, also bolster Facebook’s already outsized power in the attention economy.
Because of these arrangements, publishers like the Times are essentially being thrown into the deep end of the pool. They have to produce a lot of live video on a regular basis, without having really examined what formats work best. Generally speaking, those formats are on-the-ground instances of breaking news, and slow burns that build to a climax; not two people sitting around awkwardly talking to each other.
Spayd’s criticisms of the the paper’s efforts are one more indication that, as we’ve said before, Facebook’s conception of live video and its actual usefulness are divergent, and scenarios in which live video is useful are often tough to replicate. That places organizations like the Times, which are producing around 120 videos each month, in a tough spot.
Or, as Spayd writes: “After watching countless hours of live video in the past few weeks, I have hit upon many that are either plagued by technical malfunctions, feel contrived, drone on too long, ignore audience questions or are simply boring, by I imagine most anyone’s standards.”
You’ve almost certainly encountered “Facebook Live” — livestreamed videos filmed from users’ smartphones — in your Facebook feed sometime during the last several months, as the company is aggressively pushing the new feature on users. (The hope is that Live can reverse the downward trend of users sharing original, personal content.) What does “aggressively” mean? Well, Facebook currently has deals with dozens of large publishers — the Times, BuzzFeed, and Gawker Media among them — and is paying them to produce livestreams on Facebook. In other words, it’s spending millions of dollars to brute-force live video into popularity and ubiquity.
One problem with Live videos is that they’re the antithesis of the engaging types of Facebook video that tend to be widely shared — the videos with time-lapse cooking, text overlays, and stock music. Live is considerably rougher around the edges and often unrehearsed; it tends to require sound to be at all engaging; and for the first several months it could only be filmed on low-quality smartphone cameras.
Over the weekend, Zachary Penton called the police and told them he shot and killed his roommate Daniel Garofalo. According to a report from ABC 15, the 21-year-old Arizona man engaged in an argument with Garofalo before allegedly shooting him. Garofalo was pronounced dead when authorities arrived and Penton was taken directly into custody.
It’s a chilling story, which only gets darker after a look back at a tweet Penton allegedly sent just a day before the murder.
ABC also reports police are still investigating if the Twitter handle @Zac_Penton does, in fact, belongs to the alleged murderer. Still, it’s a pretty compelling argument for reading your roommate’s tweets.
By the numbers, Pokémon Go is seeing a decline in daily active users. (Which is not terribly surprising as summer winds down and the app’s initial buzz goes with it.) But that is apparently not the case in Taiwan, where people reportedly rushed through the streets over the weekend in an attempt to catch a Snorlax.
This isn’t the first time the augmented-reality game has sent people running. Earlier this summer, a college campus was turned into the set of a zombie movie as dozens of student roamed the campus shouting “Squirtle!” in search of, well, you know. Besides, some guy already caught all of the Pokémon so it’s time for everyone else to give up and go home.
According to Taiwanese media, Tapei’s Xinbeitou district has become a hotspot for thousands of people playing the game and chasing pocket monsters. (Please note: This clip, which originated on Facebook, has not been verified, so it’s possible these folks were not after a Snorlax at all. But either way, watching hundreds of people run around with phones in hand is still terrifying.)
For a time, there was a glorious period where the daily hell of living with multiple calendars was fixed. It was called Sunrise, and it worked shockingly well. Outlook, iCal, Google Calendars, Trello, and even weirdos like Asana could all be meshed into one calendar that made sense, and made sure you didn’t miss a conference call at 10:30 a.m. or drinks at 6:30 p.m.
For those that don’t mind paying
Then Microsoft acquired the company in 2015, and all users are now facing, on August 31, the sunset of Sunrise. While the makers promise that the same functionality will be built into Outlook, we remain, ah, skeptical it’ll be as full-featured as Sunrise was in its heyday. (For instance, there’re no current plans to bring in iCal or Google Calendar integration.)
If you just want the closest you’re gonna get to to Sunrise and don’t mind paying for it, Fantastical 2 is the easy choice. The downsides: it’s Mac only, so Windows users (which many office drones are forced to be) are left out in the cold. Still, if you’re willing to shell out the cash for a Macbook Air, this app should be a no-brainer. (Yes, the phone version is cheaper, but if you actually use your calendar for business, I would argue that switching over to your phone every time you need to make an appointment is a non-optimal solution. Just bite the bullet and get the desktop app. YMMV.)
Fantastical 2 (iOS, $9.99, OSX Desktop $49.99)
So where’s a former Sunrise user supposed to turn? The answer is, to a bunch of not-quite-as-great choices. (Also, the fact that it’s 2016 and we all have to fuck with at least three to five different calendars on a daily basis is deeply messed up, but also the subject for another article.)
Calendars 5 (iOS, $6.99)
Cloudcal (Android, Free)
For Android users who want an all-in-one solution with some design quirks
For those that have escaped the clutches of Outlook
Business Calendar 2 (Android, Free)
For Android users only, Cloudcal integrates with pretty much every calendar service. The standout feature here is that each day has a circle around it — the bigger the circle, the more you have on your plate that day, allowing you to quickly scan and figure out emptyish days to meet for coffee or sit down with your team. The fact that it also smoothly integrates with Google Calendar, Google Maps, Outlook, and Exchange is a major plus. But if you’re an iOS user, you’re gonna have to keep looking.
If you don’t have Outlook in your life, Calendars 5 will sync up your iCal and Google Calendar in a pretty slick interface. But because so much of the corporate world is still on Outlook, this may be a solution more meant for people whose jobs have weird titles like “ideation consultant.” It’s also not quite as smooth or easy to use as Fantastical 2.
Kin (Desktop for now, Free)
For Android users who just want dates and times, please.
Another Android-only app, this is a bit more bare-bones, but it is cleanly designed. It’s able to quickly bring together your Google Calendar and Exchange. Again, iCal users are going to be left out on this. It’s easy to say this isn’t a huge deal, but many users switch between Apple laptops and Android phones, and the lack of cross-compatibility is becoming increasingly onerous.
For those that really, really wish Sunrise wasn’t going away.
The bottom line? There is no great replacement for Sunrise. Like Google Reader, Mailbox, or Suck.com, sometimes beautiful things appear in our lives for a moment, and then disappear. In the meantime, I’ll be flipping through my three (sometimes four) calendar apps, hoping I don’t miss anything too vital.
This app is basically built on the promise of “We’re gonna replace Sunrise, but even better.” Kin is currently in closed beta in a web-browser-only format, though the devs have plans to bring it out to Android and iOS once they get their feet underneath them. Messing around with the beta of Kin, I found it to be very, very slick, except that it can’t bring in my Exchange calendar. But these are early days — devs promise Exchange support is coming — and this could be the app that truly takes over for Sunrise.
I’m a simple man, with a simple morning routine. First I check my Outlook calendar, and see what I have to do for work that day. Then I look at my Google Calendar, and see what my to-do list looks like — it’s much easier to add to than Outlook’s — and if there’s anything I’ll be doing with friends or acquaintances who prefer to use Google Calendar. Then I check my Mac’s Calendar app (formerly known as iCal), because about half of my stuff gets added to my iCloud calendar without my even knowing. At previous jobs, I’d then check in with Trello to see what needed to be taken care of for the day — and at one deeply weird job, I’d also check in with Asana. And by the time I’m done checking all my calendars, it’s only mid-afternoon — plenty of time to finish work.
There’s a whole ecosystem of apps designed to help you with this. Sunrise, until recently, was far and away the best of them, but there’s a whole new crop of contenders attempting to take the throne. But they range from underpowered to overpriced, and there’s still no optimal solution.
So why can’t I just have one calendar for everything? Up until recently, Sunrise provided that option, but it’s dying on August 31, and while there are alternatives, they’re either expensive or come with compromises.
Still, these format wars annoy end users. If I had my druthers, I’d probably use Google Calendar for everything, simply because its reminder service is the best (I cannot tell you how many meetings and calls I have missed because of MS Office Reminders app weakly dinging alarm clock hiding in the background of my desktop). But the process of exporting my Outlook calendar, which by far has the majority of my appointments, to Google Calendar is complicated and can’t (as far as I can tell) be automated without the help of an app.
I’m kidding, but not by much. It’s 2016. I can, if I so choose, yell at a talking black cylinder to buy me things. I can use my TV to stream nearly any movie or TV show ever made. I have nearly every email that I have ever sent going back to 2005 sitting in my Gmail account. With a few keystrokes on any search engine, I can call up images so foul and depraved they would have made the Marquis de Sade blanch.
The problem isn’t just companies being obstinate. Per the founders of Kin, an upstart calendar-merging app, the only protocol that is normalized in the calendar space, CalDAV, isn’t used by all calendar providers, meaning it isn’t as easy as it would initially seem to gather information from all providers. In addition, not everyone uses the same authentication, provides a clear documentation, or makes the the application creation process easy. So there are a couple of reasons why calendar apps tend to focus on merging just one or two calendars only.
I get it: Google has no incentive to play nice with Microsoft, Microsoft has no incentive to play nice with Apple, and Apple has no incentive to play nice with either. If you talked to each individual company, they would tell you the simple solution would be to just put everything onto one calendar, and use that. But when I get a meeting invite in Outlook I can’t quickly export that over to Google Calendars. And when someone says “How about drinks on September 8th at 6 p.m.?” Google is great at creating that as a calendar event for me, but shitty at allowing me to move it over to another calendar. And Apple is basically the kid at the back of the class who pulls out his hair strand by strand and refuses to talk to anyone.
Which, again, I get. It’s not like Burger King is going to suddenly start telling you midway through an order that the McChicken sandwich is honestly better prepared overall, plus the fries are better to boot. Especially for Microsoft, the hold MS Office and Outlook has on many companies is strong enough that it’s hard to imagine it ever wanting to making integration simple and easy.
And overall, I think the competition between Apple and Android on mobile and Apple and Microsoft on desktop is a good thing for consumers. Monopolies breed complacency, and sharp-elbowed competition between all three tech giants will benefit the consumer in the long term. But in the short term, I’m stuck between either turning my life over to an app that may or may not exist in a year or two, or starting every morning with a run through every digital calendar I currently use.
But then I go into my kitchen, where we keep a paper calendar hanging on the wall for upcoming vacations and birthdays and parties. It’s from the Audubon Society. Right now it has a Magnolia Warbler on it — a very pretty bird! — and my wife and I can both add to it at will, without worries that one of us won’t sync up properly to the other’s calendar. I sip my coffee, look at our upcoming camping trip over Labor Day weekend, and think about how much simpler this all could be.
So it’s come to this. Nearly three months after the death of Harambe the gorilla, the Cincinnati Zoo has deactivated its Twitter account, unable to withstand the swarm of ironic, peacocking outrage that has followed in the controversy’s wake.
Yesterday, the zoo’s director, Thane Maynard, said that the persistent Harambe chatter online was making it difficult for the zoo to move forward.
Farewell to the Cincinnati Zoo’s Twitter account, which is taking a well-earned respite from the dumbasses online.
Maynard is correct! The sustained, explicit badgering of the zoo was garbage behavior. As Deadspin explained yesterday, “there’s a difference between sharing your fantastic Harambe meme with the world, and 100 of you teaming it up to yell at some poor communications staffer.”
These days it feels like most celebrities are only using their Instagrams to hawk home teeth-whitening systems and weight-loss teas. But not Gaten Matarazzo. The 13-year-old star of Netflix’s Stranger Things is crafting his digital brand in a way that is nothing short of being the last pure and good thing on the internet.
Yesterday, Matarazzo posted a selfie with a fan and a caption explaining his new photo series. “I’m starting a new thing. Every fan that stops me and asks me to take a picture with them, I will ask them to take a picture with me because they mean as much to me as I mean to them. This guy was awesome, I couldn’t resist having him be in the start of my new trend,” he wrote.
That was less than 24 hours ago. Since then, Matarazzo, (who in case you don’t watch the show is known for being the adorable, hat-wearing voice of reason among the show’s nerdy kid gang) has posted two more fan selfies and counting.
Here’s hoping this doesn’t take a turn for the Justin Bieber and leave the young star filled with too much bad energy from other people and refusing fan photos altogether. Stay gold, Gaten.
That’s exaggerating a bit, but a definitive answer to the ultimate question of whether the internet is good, bad, or something else continues to elude us. This is because the internet is stateless — a network of cables and servers that allows us to do whatever we choose. The internet is what we make of it; it does not act apart from us.
It would be a fool’s errand to try and encapsulate the entirety of the World Wide Web in a single digital artifact, but fear of doing something dumb online has never stopped me before. For me, the entirety of our web experience can be summed up in a single YouTube video, titled “Green Day - Closing Time.”
Twenty-five years ago today, a computer scientist at CERN named Tim Berners-Lee opened the World Wide Web up to the public. The web, to repurpose a Douglas Adams quote, “has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.”
And obviously, Green Day did not write or perform the song “Closing Time.” The band Semisonic did. Yet, this video, as of now, has 454,214 views. Uploader gflanso saw a need to make Green Day’s “Closing Time” available to the masses and the World Wide Web allowed them do it.
Uploaded on April 26, 2008, by gflanso, this video was a vision of the future; one in which you could stream any song or film on demand, from the comfort of your own home (and later, from your cell phone). The cheesy transitions and artificial film grain hearken back to a long-lost Windows Movie Maker feel. It is now easy — maybe too easy — for anyone to produce slick, well-made content from their computers, but eight years ago, all we had were low-res photos pulled from Google Images and an insatiable love of Green Day. When I think of the days just before the social-media boom, I think of this video. Not great, but it gets the job done.
But there are also instances like Green Day’s “Closing Time,” a collective delusion that we didn’t even know was collective, or a delusion, until the internet showed us. There are people as wrong as I am everywhere, and they’re all here together, online.
There are many ways in which the web erases history, or overwrites reality. A simple edit to Wikipedia can set off a cascade of untruths and misconceptions. The work of the young, the excluded, the disenfranchised, is — at a faster and faster pace — appropriated and obfuscated by the old, entrenched powers.
And then, I assume, someone typed in “green day closing time,” searching for the song, erroneously believing that “Closing Time” was a song by Green Day. This happened 454,214 times.
A collection of electrode-lined activewear officially launched during the Rio 2016 Olympics (though it’s reportedly already been used by the likes of Rafael Nadal and Usain Bolt), and if it works, it could seriously cut down on the time you need to spend working out.
Earlier this summer, Jaelin and Brianna Joy White, two married teens and YouTube celebs whom your ninth-grade niece has maybe heard of, decided to move from their home in Arizona to Chicago, Illinois. The move did not go well, and the breathtaking saga of their subsequent flight from the crime-ridden metropolis, hopping from fast-food chain to fast-food chain, has become a YouTube sensation. Allow us to explain the tale of Jaelin, Brianna, the Man Outside the Subway, and the Escape from Chicago.
“Interstitials” — those pop-up boxes on websites exhorting readers to sign up for newsletters or like pages on Facebook that pop up — are both deeply irritating (to readers) and highly useful (to publishers desperate to retain and entice those readers). And like all things useful to publishers, they are now subject to an attempted murder: Today, Google announced two important changes to its search algorithm that will penalize sites in search rankings for using interstitials.
The email-solicit neg has become a common tactic among large publications (including this one! Ha ha, please like us on Facebook, and so on). If, for instance, you don’t want to sign up for our email list and want to clear the interstitial, you have to click “No, I don’t want smart takes on tech.” According to people in the know, this passive-aggression is effective. Also: Who doesn’t want smart takes on tech, such as this very post?
But it’s also annoying, and now Google is putting a stop to it. Sites using standalone interstitials or ones “[s]howing a popup that covers the main content” will be dinged in search rankings. That means sites will have to come up with other ways to guilt you into signing up for an email newsletter you’ll never open.
Google explains:
Reporting live from Brianna’s uncle’s kitchen back in Arizona, Jaelin and Brianna explain that on the day in question they had just driven from Ikea with their Volkswagen Jetta and were setting up house. Jaelin leaves to go to Best Buy to pick up a modem and on his way home spots a Chipotle nearby the new apartment. Inspired, the two head out to take the El train one stop to grab dinner. While waiting for the train, a man approaches Jaelin and begins to ask him questions: his name, where he lives, what he does for a living. (The couple think he targeted them for their “preppy” attire. “Even though there was way easier targets all around us,” Jaelin explains of the “girls alone” and “dudes alone” also on the platform.)
First: Who are Jaelin and Brianna? Brianna is a beauty vlogger with over 300,000 followers and Jaelin is in the house-flipping/real estate biz and regularly appears on his wife’s channel. Which means that, naturally, the two have recounted the entire series of events on YouTube, in a magisterial 16-minute-video, entitled “THE REASON WE’RE HOMELESS RIGHT NOW … (no clickbait) STORYTIME.” It has been viewed more than one million times and contains a summer blockbuster’s worth of twists, turns, and brand references. I have watched it three times already.
Feeling uncomfortable, the couple decides not to take the train. But as they walk away, the man follows them, so they seek refuge in the first place they find: a Subway. Which doesn’t work, because the man just stands outside the restaurant. Using the only cell-phone they had (which, of course, had a battery level of “like two percent”), Jaelin calls an Uber and also the police. (Brianna takes this opportunity to order a sandwich.) All this seems very logical, until Jaelin pokes his head out the front door to talk to the man. (Who, in case you forgot, has allegedly been following them.) The man starts asking Jaelin whether the police regularly frequent the area and inciting Jaelin to come out and face him.
Meanwhile! Their Uber is still five minutes away, but a driver on the street pulls up (supposedly noticing the ongoing commotion in front of the Subway) and gestures to Jaelin to get into the car. Jaelin steps outside and the man — the one who’d been following — immediately punches him in the face. Dazed, he sprints for the car, with Brianna trailing behind him, sandwiches in hand, managing to pick up the shoe Jaelin had somehow lost in the process. Also, it’s pouring rain outside?
Thoroughly distressed, Jaelin and Brianna decide they do not feel safe and cannot possibly spend the night in their new apartment, much less the city of Chicago, pack up their things, spend the night in a hotel, and head back to Arizona the next day. Where, they realize after several days of driving across the country, they leased their old apartment to a friend and are … “homeless right now.” Hence filming the video in Brianna’s uncle’s kitchen. (DNA Info reports the couple has since moved into their own place.)
What a story! There are many questions to ask, but sadly, Brianna has disabled comments on the video. Nevertheless, plenty of Chicagoans have taken to Twitter to give the couple a strong piece of their minds.
The car speeds away as the man tries to cling on through the driver’s window. After a lap, the “fake Uber” drops the pair by their car in a CVS parking lot. They notice the man is still nearby, so the two hightail it into their vehicle to get home. But then, Brianna realizes she forgot her phone in the “fake Uber” so they drive after him (the strange driver) and honk until he pulls over so they can retrieve the phone. While reaching in to grab it, Jaelin, of course, drops his wallet in the back of the car, never to be seen again.
Mostly let’s be thankful Brianna and Jaelin are safe and sound. As their newest and biggest fan, I can only imagine what antics they’ll get into next, and I cannot wait to watch.
While that might seem like a simple division meant to highlight the distinction between the company’s journalism and its entertainment, it’s really more of a merger, designed to make news think in terms of video, a form that generates more revenue than static text and images. Video, Peretti wrote to employees, “will be something we expand and embed across the organization. As digital video becomes ubiquitous, every major initiative at BuzzFeed around the world will find an expression as video, just like everything we do works on mobile and social platforms.” Eventually, more reporters will be writing (and probably starring in) videos. (And those who can’t make the transition will be left behind.) This is a smart business decision — video gets more attention, specifically on Facebook, and it’s easier to monetize.
Over the past year or so, as it’s grown from an offshoot into the acknowledged future of the company, BuzzFeed’s sprawling video operation, based in Los Angeles, has maintained a somewhat tense relationship with the editorial operation in New York, both for reasons of quality (some controversial BuzzFeed videos, such as “27 Questions Black People Have for Black People,” have been disavowed by its editorial team) and of business (the editorial department maintains a traditional separation between itself and the business side, whereas the video half has a more porous boundary).
Entertainment will be led by Ze Frank, who has been heading up the site’s massive expansion into web video under the BuzzFeed Motion Pictures moniker, while Ben Smith, BuzzFeed’s widely respected editor-in-chief, will (continue to) head up news. Frank’s ascendancy is a not-so-subtle admission that video has won the battle over the article. For the last couple of years, BFMP has been siloed from the rest of the company, producing its own videos in isolation. One former employee described to me a rare instance of collaborating with the editorial department as feeling like they were breaking the rules. Editorial employees I’ve spoken to have repeatedly admitted to being frustrated or uncomfortable with the, let’s say, simplistic portrayals of gender and sexuality in BuzzFeed videos. A frequent refrain among editorial staff members when video produces a bad video was to clarify that the departments were entirely separate.
The same thing will happen on the news side, with reporters now in no uncertain terms supporting a video operation. The current attempt at video news at BuzzFeed, led by Henry Goldman from the video department, is the latest in a handful of attempts to crack the format. “Reporters and writers are the ones who call people to interview them, who get scoops. So having really great reporters is something that’s valuable to our video news operation,” Peretti told Vanity Fair.
Vanity Fair also writes that “Peretti noted that this new structure positions BuzzFeed to become something like the Paramount of the 21st century — an entertainment conglomerate built to be consumed quickly and everywhere.” BuzzFeed, depending on the time of day and whichever way the wind is blowing, is a news operation, a tech start-up, or a Hollywood studio. Today, it’s making moves to become the latter. A critical difference is that BuzzFeed employees don’t have the same protection that film-industry unions like the Writers Guild do. They might want to change that.
This tension appears to have resolved itself in a reorganization, announced today in a memo to employees from BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti. Going forward, BuzzFeed will exist as two main departments, news and entertainment. News will cover everyone involved in news, defined broadly, while entertainment covers pretty much everything else — videos, listicles, GIFs, food videos, and experiments where people dress differently than normal.
Tyra Hunt, a high school senior from Michigan, enjoys cheerleading, track and field, and excellent viral senior-photo opportunities. Hunt made a name for herself on Twitter this week after she tweeted a picture of her new school ID card, in which the 17-year-old styled herself to look just like she did when she was 5.
“In my kindergarten picture, I was refusing to take my picture, so my principal called my mother to come to the school to to help because I wouldn’t take it,” Hunt told me via Twitter DM. “For my senior year, our school lets us have a funny ID picture because they use our real senior picture in the year book. I bought a green hoodie, ironed on USA to the front, put my hair in pig tails, and made the same face I did a while back!”
“The [kindergarten] picture is framed in the living room of my house because it’s always been funny and a joke to my family! I see it a lot,” Hunt explained. “Knowing that seniors can have funny ID pictures, it just gave me the idea.” The once-family joke has already been retweeted by nearly 20,000 people. (And that’s not counting all the accounts that have stolen Hunt’s picture and passed it off as their own.)
As for her newfound internet celebrity, Hunt says she’s just excited to get started with senior year. “I can’t wait for homecoming, football games, & spending the year getting closer to my friends before we all have to leave for college at this time next year.” Aw. Teens.
Measuring 302 feet, the Airlander 10 is known for being the longest aircraft in the world, and also for looking like a giant flying butt. Sadly, however, this triumph of buttlike engineering crashed during its second test flight on Wednesday at Cardington Airfield in Bedfordshire, England.
Some days you think there’s nothing new under the sun. Then you wander over to r/simulated and discover that a piece of CGI-rendered pizza can deeply unsettle you.
Commenters, who compared it to everything from “melted sugar” to “spiderwebs,” were quick to point out that this slize of pizza was, indeed, creepy as hell. One took the time explain just why.
But enough about this nightmarish slice. It’s almost lunch time, and we’re off to enjoy some Almost Pizza.
The BBC reports the slow-motion crash occurred during landing and that no crew members were injured. “The Airlander experienced a heavy landing and the front of the flight deck has sustained some damage which is currently being assessed,” Hybrid Air Vehicles, the company behind Airlander 10, explained in a Facebook post. Which means, the craft crashed headfirst, rather than tail-. Which is good, because had it been the other way around, I would have been contractually obligated to make a butt pun here.
The boom in micro-targeted social-media content — “Only ‘90s Kids Will Remember”; “23 Things Only New Yorkers Will Understand” — has been over for years, but the internet is still in many ways a machine designed to reconstruct individual experience into shared cultural identity. There is an odd vertigo to be generated when you realize that memories you imagined to be idiosyncratic are in fact common to thousands, if not millions, of people. Such as:
Over the past few weeks, Facebook has rolled out several changes to the way it serves ads to users. The company even started blocking ad-blockers. (Though success there has been a little shaky.) Since all users, at least in theory, are now being subjected to ads whether they want to see them or not, Facebook created a new ad preferences system to let people further customize their likes and dislikes. Also it’s kind of fun to see what Zuckerberg’s robot army thinks floats your boat.
Slomograph (Free with in-app purchases, iOS only)
Slomograph takes a quick snap and turns it into a three-second loop that you can apply various filters to. Its ease of use, combined with some of the artsier effects (I particularly dig the “Tube” effect, which looks a bit like a piece of celluloid film being burned), makes this an easy way to create a slick piece of slow-mo video.
Prisma takes your snapshots and runs through a series of very impressive filters, making your pic look like everything from a mosaic to a hand-drawn sketch. Based on some of the same neural-network tech that made Google’s Deep Dream take over the internet last summer, Prisma can take pretty much any snapshot and quickly turn it into something bizarrely beautiful. For anyone who wants a shot that’s different from the rest of their Instagram feed.
Prisma (Free with in-app purchases, iOS/Android)
Pikazo ($1.99 with in-app purchases, iOS only)
If Prisma is a little lightweight for you, there’s Pikazo, which will take your snapshots and turn them into something done in the style of a famous artist. Its tech is also pretty impressive — and can also take a second to fully finish your photo. (Above, you can see my day at the beach done in the style of Paul Klee. It’s quite striking!) If you want your day at Montauk to look like something that could hang in the Met, this is the app for you.
Enlight ($3.99, iOS only)
Think of Enlight as a super-easy-to-use version of Photoshop for your photos. You can do simple stuff like adjust contrast or advanced editing, like using a heal brush or subtle, altering color curves. You can see the before and after of one photo above (and yes, I may have gone a bit overboard). If you’re a perfectionist who knows your way around a masking layer, this is the photo-editing app for you.
Priime (Free with in-app purchases, iOS only)
At heart, Priime is a set of filters for your photos. But these filters have been selected by some of the world’s best photographers, and Priime will analyze the color and content of your pic to suggest the best one. For those that want the cachet of saying their pic’s filter was picked out by Pei Ketron, this is the app to get. (The above pic uses the “Bushwick” filter, selected by the NYC photog Vivienne Gucwa.)
To see which people, places, and things Facebook’s algorithm already thinks you are into, head here. From there, you’ll see a list of potential interest categories like “Technology,” “News and entertainment,” and “Lifestyle and culture.” Here’s what that last one looks like for me. Apparently, Facebook thinks I’m very liberal and an avid reader who lives away from her family with a penchant for adopting new technology late. (Not a half-bad read, Facebook.)
If any of the interests aren’t, well, interesting to you, it’s easy to delete them. Just hover your curser over the icon you want to remove and click the X in the upper righthand corner. You’ll see a notification that the interest has been removed. (Sorry, Salesforce Marketing Cloud.)
Ad preferences aren’t new to Facebook, but the updated system is a lot simpler to use than the last time I attempted to customize my Facebook ads and stop myself from seeing nothing but wrestling promos once and for all. And if you have to see ads (and you do, otherwise I’ll be out of a job), they might as well be things you’re interested in. Excuse while I go delete my interest in “Handheld PCs.”
Outside of a rarefied top tier, it can be extremely hard to make money in creative fields online. Writers are continually asked to work for pennies or, even worse, “exposure.” Artists may have it even worse. Clients want to pay a paltry sum for work that can take hours — and is then snatched and put to use by third parties without credit or payment.
At an unsteady time to be a professional creative, furry commissions offer stable supplementary income for many artists. Sara Jensen, a 28-year-old artist in Minnesota, estimates that she makes around $500 drawing ten or so illustrations per month. “Some people make a lot more than me, some people make just, you know, ‘I want to go out tonight, can I take a commission so I can go to a movie or whatever.’”
Because fursonas are unique for every person, it’s practically impossible to get a rendering of one’s fursona without paying money for it. (Dressing up as one’s fursona is also common practice, but high-end costumes can run thousands of dollars.) Using generic images is frowned upon in the community, and using a drawing of someone else is practically begging for punishment. “I’d say that [getting a drawing of your fursona is] pretty much expected, to be honest with you,” Ted, who goes by Doctor Fox online, tells me. Not having a drawing of your fursona, according to Ted, “would kind of be like having a Facebook profile with no picture. Just because you have your name on there, your friends are gonna be like, ‘Uh, who’s this?’” He estimates that “99 percent” of furries have something they’ve commissioned from an artist.
Either way, the furry fandom is a reliable place to find work. “The demand in the furry community, such as it is, is a very different thing than in other fields and groups that want/need art,” writer and self-described furry community historian Colin Spacetwinks explained to me over Twitter DM. The main reason is that furries, people interested in anthropomorphic animals, often have animal alter-egos known as a fursona. “Say you’ve got a fursona,” Spacetwinks says. “You’ve imagined it. You know in your head what they look like, you think they look pretty cool, and you think to yourself, ‘Gosh, I’d like to see that somewhere other than in my own brain.’ But you can’t draw. There’s only one way you’re going to get that: Someone else draws it for you.”
But there is still at least one online community that treats artists with respect and pays fair prices for original work — one community that artists can rely on when editors, publishers, and social networks make it more and more difficult to get paid. When it comes to commissioning original works of art, nobody can match the furries.
Illustrator Amber Hill, who goes by Vantid online, says that she took her first furry commission when she was 19 years old. She’s now 33. “When I accept new work, it’s usually about a quarter to a half of my income,” she wrote over email. While she wasn’t comfortable discussing specifics, she said that furry commissions were “enough to support my mortgage habit, ha-ha.”
“I really enjoy hearing the backstories behind each character I paint for people,” she admitted. “Some people just make characters that are fun to look at and draw, and some have volumes of tales for each of their characters.”
Furry commissions aren’t one-and-done. By his own estimate, Ted spends between $500 and $700 a year on commissions (put in perspective, that’s about as much as daily delivery of the New York Times). He says he gets a new commission every two or three months, usually by browsing FurAffinity or through word of mouth. He describes it as ”Oh, I have $50 in my rainy-day funds, this artist is open, I really wanted this from them so I’m gonna go ahead and spend my money.”
(The furry art economy isn’t static, either — it goes through trends. When the show BoJack Horseman debuted, getting your fursona drawn in the style of the show’s character designer, Lisa Hanawalt, was super popular. The trend right now, according to Ted, is getting custom stickers to use on the messaging app Telegram. “One that I have is my character in front of the American flag, to replace the American-flag emoji, and then one of my other hobbies is shooting, so I have my character with a pistol in one of them,” Ted explained.)
For this piece, I briefly considered asking artists if they wanted to contribute work for free, before immediately realizing how hypocritical that was. So after deciding on Select All’s fursona (my colleague Madison suggested a raccoon because we dig through internet trash), I emailed artist Molly Wiedemann and commissioned a piece. Six hours, and one $50 PayPal transfer later, I had the beautiful specimen — a raccoon using our blue-and-yellow color scheme — that you see at the top of this page. A painless process that, if for some reason I need a bespoke anthropomorphic animal drawn, I’d gladly go through again.
Katie Hofgard, a full-time freelance illustrator, uses her income from furry commissions and a variety of other projects to support both herself, her boyfriend, and their cat. “People in the furry fandom usually want a depiction of one of their personal characters, usually an anthropomorphic animal or fantasy animal of some kind,” she said over email. “It’s their imagined world, which I get to bring to life for them. Maybe they’re exploring a ruin, going for a peaceful walk, enjoying a cup of tea, or enacting a part of their story.”
The lowest pricing tiers are generally black-and-white sketches and head shots for around $25, but if you wanted something more painterly, or a full-body sketch, it could run you hundreds of dollars.
Which is not to say that she doesn’t get interesting requests. “One of the weirdest ones I got was someone who was like, ‘Hey, do you draw My Little Pony?’ I’m like, ‘Of course I do.’ I draw basically anything. And they’re like, ‘Would you draw a — just a normal My Little Pony, but like super muscle-y?’ And I was like, ‘What? Yeah, I’ll do that.’”
“One thing that I really like from working with furries versus working with other people is furries are really easygoing, which is awesome,” Jensen admitted. “A lot of the time they’ll be like, ‘You can do whatever you want,’ or they’ll give me a really general theme and I can draw what comes to mind.”
Hill, who does not consider herself a furry, was ebullient in her praise for the fandom. “The furry fandom has been remarkable to me, and I am so thankful for the people who are a part of it,” she wrote. “I’ve become dear friends with some of my clients, traveled the world with a few. In 2008, I was commissioned for a piece of art with a coyote and a raven. In 2014, I married that client … and I still owe him some artwork!! Ha!”
Hill said that the only type of requests that qualify as “weird” are the ones that ask her to work for free or “exposure.”
Cuddlist is the latest app to attempt to profit from society’s soul-crushing loneliness by dispatching professional cuddlers (call them Cuddlists) to come to your apartment and hold you, for a flat fee of $80 an hour. It’s worth noting that their name is significantly less annoying than their competitor’s, Spoonr, because it has all its proper vowels and isn’t trying to play off a dating-app name.
Summer’s ending: The days are getting shorter, the temperature is dropping, and the subway no longer feels like living in someone’s gym shorts. To make the most out of your last trip to the beach (and to make your friends really jealous), here are some of my favorite photo-editing apps.
Yikes! I found these tweets chilling both because, like, ha ha, wow, right? Lost: Season One, anyone? but also because this particular reference is obsolete by a decade already. The first DVD players were available in the U.S. in 1997 and not widely adopted in dens and dorm rooms until a few years later. Hulu was introduced in 2006; Netflix began streaming movies a year later. The window for teenagers and 20-somethings to form, uh, complicated memories regarding the DVD menu for Lord of the Rings: The Extended Edition was narrower than ten years. Before that, your closest analogue is probably the automatic ejection of a VHS tape; afterward, it’s Netflix menus.
But that’s not even enough, is it? As technology makes itself central to daily life, generational taxonomy stops being about your temporal relationship to defining world-historical events (Woodstock! The fall of the Berlin Wall! The launch of OK Soda!) and more about, well: When did you get on Facebook? When did you get on Snapchat? Did you steal music by shoplifting CDs, by torrenting album releases, or by listening to YouTube rips? Were the most fragile and hormonal moments of your psychological development ineluctably corrupted by the deleterious effects of the internet? Do you think “Dat Boi” is funny or baffling? Are you a Netflix-and-chill millennial, or a Fumbling-DVD-Menu-Sex millennial?
It’s a minor touchstone, but it’s a telling one. Among the most striking effects of the accelerated pace of technological change is the rapidity with which shared social experiences suddenly become obsolete. Remember what it was like to go to high school with a “dumb” cell phone? Unless you were one of the relatively few people born into that particular moment where cell phones were widespread but smartphones were not … probably not!
Note: Because of the travel budget I could not go to the beach, so I tested the apps by watching a three-hour-long YouTube video of the beach. It was almost like being there!
I mean, yes, right, I’m woke; I know that “generations” are nothing but loose schema used by corporations to market products. But even by those debased standards, “millennial” is meaningless. My experience of high school was hugely different from the experience of people just five or six years younger than I am, for whom the fraught social dynamic of adolescence was mediated not through AIM and text messages but through Facebook and smartphones. New Yorker writer Nathan Heller suggests that “millennials” be divided into “Builders” — who were adolescents on September 11 — and younger “Firebrands.” (New York Times Magazine editor Willy Staley proposes the more succinct, and possibly more accurate, “Good” and “Bad” millennials.)
GIFYme (Free with in-app purchaeses, iOS only)
This app allows you to take six-second time-lapse videos and turn them into videos or GIFs that can be easily shared on Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr, or pretty much anywhere a GIF can be put. It’s the perfect app for capturing that amazing little moment from the weekend you’ll never forget, like when a dog wandered in front of the camera during a three-hour video stream of beach waves.
The extremely sweaty season is just about over, meaning it’s time to declare which over-produced tune gets the coveted honor of being 2016’s Song of Summer. But we’re a tech blog — what would we possibly know about music. Instead, we’re going to let our good friend Mr. Twitter do the awarding.
Based on data collected between May 27 and August 19, the company tallied up all the tweet references to tunes released over the summer, People reports. The winner: “Cold Water” by Major Lazer feat. Justin Bieber. (You know, the one with the earworm chorus of “I won’t let go, I’ll be your lifeline tonight” that repeats ad nauseam until you can’t remember your own name.)
Runner-ups included “Into You” by Ariana Grande, “Make Me” by Britney Spears, “Rise” by Katy Perry, and “Work From Home” by Fifth Harmony. Clearly, the takeaway is that everyone had the good sense not to tweet about that garbage Justin Timberlake song from Trolls, which haunted my dreams all summer long.
Just before the 2016 Rio Olympics kicked off, the International Olympic Committee laid down a new rule regarding news organizations sharing its digital content: Thou shalt not GIF the Olympic Games on pain of death. (Officially, the mandate said “the use of Olympics material transformed into graphic animated formats such as animated GIFs (i.e. GIFV), GFY, WebM, or short-video formats such as Vines and others, is expressly prohibited,” but where’s the dramatic flair in that?) Now, a man says he was kicked off Twitter after sharing a GIF of Aly Raisman’s floor routine.
Until today, Jim Weber was a heavy Twitter user with nearly 100,000 followers and 69,000 tweets. (Nice.) “Sure, I didn’t have the rights to any footage at the Olympics — just like countless blogs and users don’t have rights to the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and NCAA footage that they create GIFs out of and profit from every day,” Weber, who works in the sports-media industry, explained in a lengthy blog post on LinkedIn. “But I figured the worst thing that would happen is the GIF would be deleted from my account, as Twitter often does in these situations.”
Except that isn’t what happened. Over the weekend, Weber received a DMCA takedown notice from Twitter via email, which included a letter from the IOC director of legal affairs. (This feels like a lot of work to get one guy to take down one GIF, but okay, IOC.) According to the note, Weber had ten minutes to reply to the IOC and comply with their request to “immediately and permanently remove the material.” But three minutes later, he received a second email informing him that his account had been suspended. (Twitter did not immediately respond to Select All’s request for comment.)
Today, four days later, Weber says he received another email from Twitter, this one informing him that he had been permanently banned from using the micro-blogging platform under the handle @JimMWeber. (Reminder: This is the same punishment Milo Yiannopoulos received after leading hateful trolls against Leslie Jones.) Weber says he regrets sharing the GIF, but also that he believes Twitter is using him as an example.
When the IOC announced the GIF ban before the games, my Select All colleague Brian Feldman wrote that the situation could go one of two ways: “At best, the IOC won’t really care. At worst, the committee and platforms will be playing the world’s most nihilistic game of Whac-A-Mole.” In this case, Weber has become the mole. Now it’s only a question of whether there will be more and whether the whacking is justified.
From Weber via Linkedin:
With 150 million daily active users, it’s a good time to be Snapchat — and a bad time to be a middle manager at a large tech company that would like a piece of that action. Facebook has spent the last few months mimicking the ephemeral messaging app across a number of different services and features, including Instagram Stories, Instagram Explore, and Lifestage (a standalone video-messaging app just for teens). Now it’s Apple’s turn.
When WhatsApp was purchased by Facebook three years ago for $19 billion, the hugely popular messaging app, which had a hard-won reputation for protecting user privacy, assured its users that “nothing” would change. Well, not quite. In a blog post, WhatsApp announced changes to its terms of service that will allow the app to share data with their parent company.
Facebook gets something out of this as well: By receiving data like user phone numbers, and operating system and device information, it can link Facebook users to their WhatsApp accounts, and more effectively target those users for ads as well. With Messenger and WhatsApp — which is practically a verb akin to “Google” in many countries — Facebook processes triple the number of standard SMS text messages every day.
Emphasizing that message content itself will stay encrypted and unreadable by anyone except the user (theoretically), WhatsApp writes:
According to a report from Bloomberg today, the company is reportedly working on a “video sharing and editing application.”
But as Bloomberg also notes, Apple has scrapped standalone apps before, instead choosing to package them along with their existing products. (Like the Memories feature that has become standard in the Photos app.) Apple already has an absurdly (and somewhat accidentally) successful messaging app in Messages, its SMS-and-messaging app. So don’t be surprised if you end up seeing Apple’s take on Snapchat built directly into Apple’s messages program. The forthcoming iOS 10 update, with its animated doodles, emojifier, and slew of other colorful messaging options already feels a little like a gimmick aimed at the Snapchat generation. Including video messaging would only up that ante.
This robot is a far cry from your average tattoo artist. Sure, that’s mainly because it’s a robot instead of a human, but you’ll also never have to feel insecure about how much cooler it is than you. You also won’t have to wonder whether it’s judging you for getting an ambiguous Chinese symbol tattooed on your lower back. The robot was designed by Pierre Emm and Johan da Silveira, two Autodesk artists-in-residence.
Harambe is dead, but his legacy lives on at Troy High School in Michigan where four students decided to memorialize the the late silverback gorilla on their student ID cards.
The students – Natalie, Maddie, Caroline, and Tiffany – are all rising seniors who work together on the school yearbook. “We wanted to do something unique for our school ID photos,” Natalie told me via Twitter DM. “The day before our ID photos were taken, we decided to all wear green t-shirts and to write out in sharpie ‘ha-ram-be’ and the years of his existence.” She also made sure to let me know that these pictures are only for their IDs and won’t be appearing in the actual yearbook.
Larger sites, at least, have the warm embrace of wealthy investors. For now. Vice, which began as an outlet encouraging Canadian bad boys to take a bunch of amphetamines and put their dicks in weird places, sold an 18 percent stake in the company to Disney, a company that until recently required its amusement-park employees to shave their beards. (Vice CEO Shane Smith said that he’d be cool with Disney acquiring the other 82 percent as well.) Last year, NBCUniversal gave both Vox and BuzzFeed $200 million each.
Still, staying independent is hard. Gawker Media is on track to bring in more than $50 million in revenue this year but was forced to declare bankruptcy, arguably because it didn’t have a well-funded corporate overlord to shield it from Peter Thiel’s bottomless pockets (or, depending on your preference, to rein in its worst excesses). But most tellingly, something like a third (and growing) of Gawker’s revenue isn’t coming from traditional display ads, but from affiliate marketing links to Amazon and other sites. Text can still be profitable, as long as it’s selling something.
Vice almost doesn’t belong with these other businesses: Its website has always been a loss-leader whose traffic was never intended to be large enough to generate self-sustaining revenue from display ads. Vice’s real product isn’t its articles but the premium videos it creates in collaboration with advertisers. Seen from this point of view, Viceland, its new cable channel, makes sense. (Sort of: According to The Wall Street Journal, “The company has to host regular screenings with pizza and beer so that its largely 20-something staffers can actually see the shows they spend their days making”; millennials don’t have cable.) It also produces a nightly news show, premiering on HBO next month. Rather than going full-tilt into the social-media maelstrom, Vice is shutting itself inside the old-media bunker of television.
Like Vice, Vox Media is flirting with television — its tech(ish) site the Verge now hosts an online after-show following Mr. Robot. But it’s also expanding into live events. Tech site Recode hosts an annual conference that rich dork geniuses pay thousands of dollars to attend; the Verge helped throw the Panorama music festival in New York a few weeks ago; and explainatron Vox(.com) presents a clear opportunity to sell exorbitantly priced conference passes to the people who call the White House Correspondents’ Dinner “Nerd Prom.”
This is where Medium has stepped in. The platform-slash-publisher-turned-definitely-platform has struck deals with a number of beloved small websites — including the Awl, Pacific Standard, and the Ringer, the Bill Simmons site primarily funded by HBO — to publish on Medium. The main pitch is that Medium handles the technical implementation and upkeep of the sites (reducing overhead costs) and helps sell ads, taking a cut of the revenue. But whether or not that is a sustainable business model for either Medium or for those sites remains to be seen.
As always, the company most worth watching is BuzzFeed, which has been dominant for the past half-decade precisely because of its ability to quickly adapt to changes in the digital environment. And even though slower growth than hoped led to missed revenue goals and slashed projections earlier this year, BuzzFeed’s still pushing hard into video. This week’s reorganization has planted seeds of its Motion Pictures department all over the company, as both the news and entertainment sections feverishly produce more and more footage.
And why not? The truth is, just because advertisers are eager for video doesn’t mean it’s a smart or sustainable move. Tronc, the rebranded version of newspaper magnate Tribune Publishing, is also trying to do a lot of video. They’re hoping to use algorithms, and artificial intelligence, and video to optimize content and increase engagement and monetize and build their brand … ? I think. Unless the actual videos they create are more compelling than their pitch, they’re in trouble.
BuzzFeed will be fine — as will Vox and Vice. They have enough money to produce video. It’s the middle class of digital media — the kind that doesn’t have the cash or ability to build a large video operation — that’s nervous. Advertisers are willing to pay more for video, and if you’re not making it, you may not be able to get into client meetings that will land you big contracts. (One solution: Automate your video process!)
Earlier this week, Kelly Conaboy asked, at the Hairpin-on-Medium, what happened to blogging. There are cultural answers to the question, but ultimately, well, it’s gotten too hard to make money from it. It’s not that writing is dead, or that we’ve moved to a “post-text” world. In fact, the problem may be that there’s too much text. It’s the easiest content to produce and is in high supply. I’m doing it right now! But text is not a high-margin business. Writing isn’t what media orgs do to pay the bills anymore; it’s the bonus afterward.
For months, Select All has been diligently covering this dumb bus being tested in China. Okay, actually we wrote two blog posts about it. But the entire time, we have never given in to intense external pressures asserting that the bus is not dumb. It’s dumb as hell, and we have courageously said this when nobody else would. The Transit Elevated Bus — which is on rails and so is really a train — is dumb.
But is it also a scam????
That’s what Adam Minter asserted earlier this week at Bloomberg View.
Using a peer-to-peer lending platform, property developer Bai Zhiming acquired the technology behind the TEB last year, and subsequently raised more than $26 million, “promising high returns to be paid out years in advance of any potential deployment of the technology.” Such promises, according to Minter, often go unfulfilled. “In those cases,” he writes, “P2P might be better described as peer-to-Ponzi.” More than 200 people who invested in the TEB through service Huaying Kailai are now asking for their money back.
The TEB, once the future of transportation, is now likely turning into a huge black eye for the Chinese government and its poorly regulated peer-to-peer lending market. We expected the bus to be dumb, be we never expected it to be dumb in this particular way.
Texas fourth-grader Kevin is going places. Namely, the fourth grade. And after that, as he told Fox News on the first day of school earlier this week, he’ll be headed to the fifth grade. And after that, he’ll be off to college.
Kevin’s interview is currently topping /r/videos on Reddit, where people can’t seem to get enough of his outspoken excitement. In it, he explains that he had just one friend at his old school and is hoping he’ll be able to make more friends this time around. (Kevin, if you’re reading this, the Select All staff will be your friends.) He also offers some excellent commentary on why math is important, “I want to be a creator, like inventing stuff, and I need to learn a lot of math to do it,” and how lame helmets are, “I know how to ride a bike already, even without protective gear!”
Good luck with fourth grade, Kevin. Though I don’t think you’ll need it.
Earlier this week, we dragged you through the emotionally harrowing journey of Brianna Joy and Jaelin White, two married, teenage YouTubers who fled Chicago (or more specifically, Edgewater, a lakefront community in the northern section of the city) just a day after moving to town. There was fighting! There was Subway! There was (almost) Chipotle!
Now, all you lucky folks in the Chicago area can relive the horrors on The Brianna and Jaelin Walking Tour on September 6. Brought to you by Kevin Fergus, a “three-month Edgewater resident,” the tour will stop by all the sites from Brianna and Jaelin’s drama-filled 24-hour stint in the Windy City. More than 1,000 people have already checked the “going” box on Facebook, with another nearly 3,000 people marking themselves as “interested.”
From the event description:
I hope all you Midwesterners will don your finest off-brand white polo shirts (Jaelin’s look of choice) and attend. For those of us farther away, we can only hope someone will have the good sense to Facebook Live what is sure to be an incredible and educational event.
The future of medicine is apparently opening your mouth wide and letting a snakelike robot take it from there. At least, that’s what Howie Choset of Medrobotics and inventor of Flex Robotic System is hoping.
The robot does not operate autonomously. Instead, a doctor positions the snake in a patient’s mouth and controls the device with a “joystick-like controller,” as well as “lasers, graspers, and other instruments,” Bloomberg reports. (Oh, gamified surgery! Fun!) With the help of the robot, doctors will be able to perform surgeries in traditionally hard-to-reach places with minimal invasiveness and “remove otherwise inoperable tumors and reduce the need for radiation treatment for certain cancers.” Of course, you have to be okay with that whole doctor-shoving-a-robotic-snake-down-your-unconscious-throat thing.
Maybe snake bot will befriend my other favorite piece of 2016 medical robot technology: meat robot. Designed by a team at MIT, the tiny, swallowable bot’s meaty exterior dissolves when it hits the stomach, revealing a robot doctors can use to navigate foreign objects (think swallowed batteries) out of the body. Isn’t technology great?
You know your IT person at work? Next time you see them, say hi. Maybe ask how their day is going. Because that person, should they so choose, could easily read every pretty much everything you’ve ever looked at or your typed into your computer at work. From every catty Slack DM (“lol, please steven tell us again about yr trip to france”) to emails sent from your own personal email account, if you’re doing it on your company’s network, it’s an open book.
“Anything done on company equipment can be seen,” emails Paul, a systems administrator from the Minnesota area. “There is effectively no exception to this. Things that are encrypted can be decrypted and/or intercepted in transit, and there are also keyloggers and screen-capture software.”
“While the capability is there and every company threatens their employees with it, there is really very little ‘active’ monitoring,” emails Don, a network administrator in New York State. “They simply do not want to know about it unless they are forced to, because it just costs time and effort to deal with it.”
You can get so lazy that your bosses start to wonder just what the hell you do all day. “I had to set up logging on a developer who was being watched because his productivity and output were very low,” says Paul. “Through captured third-party IM and email traffic, as well as application activity on the person’s computer, it was discovered that he was spending 80 percent of his time doing another job for another company while at his desk in the office of our company. He lost at least one of his jobs that day.”
You can fuck up a system admin’s network. “If a file server I administer suddenly starts filling up, I will find out why,” says Paul. “Often it’s a person saving personal videos or music to the system. Usually this is a video of Junior’s soccer match, but it’s not always that bland. In these cases I’m not trying to call anyone out or get them in any trouble, but my systems have to perform to a standard, and when I find out why they are not a person’s activity might come to light.”
That doesn’t just mean your work email account can be sifted through. It means your Google Hangouts, your Slack or HipChat DMs, even your emails sent from your phone (if you’re logged into your company’s Wi-Fi) are all fair game. If you’re on a work machine, keyloggers can be installed and automated screenshot software can be set up to track everything you’re looking at. The main thing protecting you? Network admins and your company probably don’t care what you’re up to.
So, for the most part, you can continue to chat a co-worker about how awful that PowerPoint presentation yesterday really was. But there are several key things that can bring you under the microscope — and once you’re under, there’s not much you can hide.
Or you can be committing actual crimes. “In one case fraud was suspected and employees of a call center were found to be working together to lift one-time-use codes that could be used to get cash from customers’ accounts at locations that accepted our payment method,” says Paul. “They were fairly sneaky about it and the real proof came only through screenshots of both computers while coded messages were sent back and forth and each performed a different task in the scheme. Investigations started after several clients noticed small amounts of money missing and the transactions all happened near our office at about lunchtime.”
Still, the real giveaway is often just your behavior on the job — and not necessarily what you’re doing online. “The main reason I get involved is when there is already a suspicion that something is happening,” says Paul. “This most often comes from non-technical sources such as attitude or personality.”
And sometimes even the watchers end up getting watched. “I was once monitored myself and was brought into my boss’s office because I was the No. 1 user of IM for a few months in a row,” says Paul. “This was ten years ago, when IM wasn’t as widely used. I had to sit with the boss while he read nearly every IM conversation and answer questions about why they were sent. Ninety percent of them were work-related and the other 10 percent were things like my wife asking me to pick up milk on the way home. It was really only an annoyance, but it’s an illustration of how to get noticed.”
You can be really bad at looking at pornography. “Someone was caught with porn on their computer,” says Don. “They went to IT for another problem, and the IT person was not snooping but the porn was really obvious, like right on the desktop. The co-worker was obligated to report it, and the person was warned. They asked IT again for something, and it was seen again, and the person was fired.”
Paul agrees. “If using your own device off the company network there isn’t an easy, legal way to track your usage without subpoenas.” So if you’re the paranoid sort and feel the need to really let loose without the eyes of your corporate overlords watching over you, keep your phone nearby, load up on a hefty data plan, and stay away from the company Wi-Fi. (Also? Maybe start looking for a new job, because the one you have sounds like it kinda bites.)
But say you really, really need to vent to a co-worker about how your boss is the fucking worst. How can you make sure that information is never seen? “If you are truly concerned about being monitored,” says Don, “the solution is to use your personal equipment. Use your personal phone (not on the corporate Wi-Fi) to message the person you want to tell on their personal phone (again, not on the corporate Wi-Fi).”
Still, there are some odd ducks out there, right? What if the IT person just wants to get their jollies by seeing what you’re up to at work? “I have never done this for fun,” says Paul. “I know people who have and some of those people were themselves monitored because of the activity, which became a bit of a comedic circle of surveillance.”
In the end, if you work at any company large enough to hire a systems administrator, everything you do can be spied on. The best protection you have? You’re pretty dull. “I don’t [monitor random people] because it’s against policy and immoral, but mainly because it’s just not interesting to me,” says Paul. “People tend to be pretty boring most of the time.”
While the internet is full of “artists” and artists, it’s rare to come across one so iconic, so daring, and so pure as @Tw1tterPicasso a.k.a. Picasso Baby. The alter ego of an Australian man named Corey, the Twitter account has racked up nearly 8,000 followers in just a month — thanks largely to its production of breathtaking art.
Several Chinese news sites, Kotaku notes, are reporting that a man in the city of Weifang was arrested this week for destroying local optical networks in the area in an attempt to prevent people from seeing pictures of him square-dancing. In other words, he tried to take down the actual internet because he thought there might be some embarrassing photos of him on it.
The Nanfang writes that the man has only been identified as Liu. According to their reading of Chinese-language accounts:
He was arrested a week ago. Despite his setbacks, the dream of one day destroying the internet and freeing ourselves from this digital oubliette remains alive.
I come from a pretty artsy family and have been drawing my whole life. I studied art in school, but unfortunately I failed. I would love to see my teacher’s face now knowing he failed someone who’s been called the greatest artist of this generation. I made this account and started drawing the good People of Twitter about four weeks ago
First, can you tell us a little bit more about yourself?
Select All briefly caught up with Picasso Baby via Twitter DM to find out a little bit more about the rising star.
Quite a few of my followers.
That’s some high praise. Who has called you “the greatest artist of this generation”?
Damn. So you said you started the account four weeks ago. What prompted you?
I had two weeks off work for holidays and was bored so I made a Twitter. While I was tweeting my 2-year-old sister was on the floor drawing, I was like wow, she is a really good drawer and it inspired me to get back into my art that I once forgot.
Can you tell me a little bit more about your art background?
I used to draw a lot as a child. I always got in trouble for it though, because it was usually on the walls. I developed my skills pretty early and was able to colour in the lines by the early age of 16. I won my first colouring in competition at the age of 20, but unfortunately I couldn’t get the credit for it because I coloured it for my sister’s year four school colouring in competition.
Your style is pretty distinct, can you tell me a bit more about that?
I used to draw a lot with Sharpies and to be honest I think accidentally inhaling the fumes has influenced my current style.
Have you heard the song by Jay Z called “Picasso Baby?” I got it from that.
Yeah. Those fumes will get you every time. So explain how the name “Picasso Baby” came to be?
I think he would love it. I knew his name, but I wasn’t familiar with his artwork. It is purely coincidental that we have a similar style. Although, I think if he was alive today I would still have more Twitter followers.
That’s what I figured. What do you think the real Picasso would think of your art?
Drawn with a basic ballpoint pen, his works are simple, yet possess a striking surrealist edge not unlike the style of Picasso Baby’s namesake. He operates mainly on commission. “If u want a drawings straight away PayPal me anything more then $3 and leave your @ name,” Picasso Baby explains in his Twitter bio, though he has also been known to render Twitter avatars into art for free for followers who ask nicely.
Go to Rafael Rozendaal and Reinier Feijen’s Blank Windows. Click a window. Rearrange it slightly. Drag a corner upward to make it a bit smaller. Drag a corner downward to make it a bit bigger. Drag another window over. Bring a window to the top of the stack. Continue to do this for hours. You are now experiencing the platonic form of office work.
Plenty of philosophers have poked holes in this theory, but Blank Windows is as solid an argument against Plato’s Theory of Forms as you’ll find. Because here it is: the essence of office work, distilled down to perfection, right in our plane of human existence. The windows you drag around your screen are all, essentially, blank, devoid of any real matter. You move these empty boxes around for roughly eight hours a day. Occasionally you go into larger rooms and sit with others and watch more blank windows, sometimes a whole series of them in a progression. Sometimes in one of the blank windows, people will send us a link to look at another equally blank window.
Plato’s Theory of Forms, to do a quick Intro to Philosophy recap, holds that everything we see and experience in reality, whether that’s a Cobb salad or love, is actually a slightly imperfect version of its true form. In some other realm, there is a perfect Cobb salad, from which all Cobb salads in our world take their cue. But the nature of human existence means the Cobb salad we actually eat is slightly imperfect — there is an alteration from that perfect Cobb salad that exists outside our universe. Per Plato, we can, and should, strive to find a Cobb salad as close to its perfect form as possible, but we will never find it.
The window I am typing in has words in it, but in reality it is empty. The window you are reading has the words I have just typed, but, again, actually contains nothing.
Go back to Blank Windows. Find another window. Continue to click downward. There are infinite blank windows, all the way down. Eventually, the working day will end. The blank windows will be waiting for you tomorrow.
Google’s virtual-reality paintbrush has been called “the first great VR app,” but that doesn’t mean it will make you a great artist. What it will do, however, is turn your apartment into a trippy, immersive environment where you have a paintbrush that shoots out stars and fire and stuff.
Imagine for a moment you are a conducting important genetic research instead of just staring at your computer screen counting the minutes till the weekend. You are working with data for the gene “Septin 2,” which you shorten to “Sept2.” Except when you input “Sept2” into Microsoft Excel, the program automatically renders it as a date, “9/2/2016.” And now your data is, well, just a date book.
Last month, Instagram started rolling out a similar filtering feature to prominent users like Taylor Swift and Chrissy Teigen. Twitter introduced its quality filter — an automated spam-filtering option previously only available to verified users — earlier this month.
The past month has not been great for Twitter, and considerably worse for its users, as several high-profile cases of harassment — against people like Leslie Jones and Olympian Gabby Douglass — have left users frustrated. Twitter has so far been vague about what they are doing to minimize this sort of behavior, which has long plagued the service and seems to be nearing a breaking point.
According to Bloomberg, Twitter is weighing whether or not to introduce a filtering tool that will let users avoid specified keywords. It’s unclear what is causing Twitter’s trepidation about introducing such a feature — third-party Twitter clients and even their own Tweetdeck software allow keyword muting, though the apps are used by a very small subset of users. Twitter did not comment on Bloomberg’s story.
It’s a problem that many researchers face. According to the Washington Post, 20 percent of genetics papers analyzed in a recent study were found to have errors caused by Microsoft Excel “converting gene names to things like calendar dates or random numbers.” And there is no way to go back and undo the auto-filled changes once they are made.
But even worse, you can’t turn off the feature in Excel with one click and call it a day. Instead, if you want the program to render what you type as text, you’ll have to remember to manually adjust the column every time you type. (Which doesn’t sound tedious at all.) Google Sheets, however, doesn’t have theses issues. Which would be good to remember for your hypothetical career as a geneticist.
This should go without saying, but in case you are an actual child, here goes: If you find yourself at a county fair, don’t hit the cows. Or walk between a pair of them and aggressively elbow their ribs. If you do, you run the risk of getting stuck there. And if you do, Reddit will find you, GIF you, and the internet at large will laugh at you. And you’ll probably deserve it.
Few other details (like where or when this happened) can be gleaned from the video, but honestly, it doesn’t matter. There is a kid. Stuck between two cows. And that is all you need to know.
In a GIF making the rounds on /r/instant_regret today, you can see a young, brace-faced boy giving an interview at what appears to be some sort of fair. (Prize ribbons and livestock being the context clues here.) He seems nice enough, but the real star is the kid behind him, who gets trapped between two cows and attempts (unsuccessfully) to claw his way back out until a woman lifts him out from his bovine prison.
Three months after Gizmodo reported that the editors of Facebook’s Trending Topics suppressed conservative news stories and outlets, the social network announced today that humans will no longer write the summaries for trending topics.
Recode writes:
So far, what’s replacing story summaries on the homepage is just a number: “11K people talking about this” (Sarah Jessica Parker) or “1M people talking about this” (Netflix). And, while that may not quite address the political or editorial concerns, it’s a welcome change. The root problem of Trending Topics has always been Facebook’s lack of transparency. “5.6K people” might not tell you why Republican Party of Minnesota is trending — but it does tell you that it’s a relatively small number of people who are discussing it, which is much more useful information than a short summary written in the alien’s-first-day-on-Earth tone of Trending Topics past.
This doesn’t sound like it’s going to quell conservative fears. Arguably, it was news selection that got Facebook in trouble in the first place, not the actual wording of the summaries themselves.
In the past, a combination of algorithmic surfacing and human editorial judgement worked in concert to determine what appeared in the sidebar. The small summaries — “Go Topless Day: Sunday Marks Annual Day of Support for Public Female Toplessness,” read one from today — were written by humans. Now, though, such poetry will disappear from our screens, and Facebook will use computer programs to automatically excerpt story summaries.
Featuring ten speeds, a fully waterproof casing, and measuring 4.84 by 1.22 inches, the battery-operated device seems fine as far as vibes go. Plus, bonus points for novelty value. (And the fact that the product specs just taught me that an eggplant is, in fact, not a vegetable, but rather a fruit.) You can buy one here, and the company promises to ship the device discreetly so your nosy neighbors wont know you are getting off on … well anyway, you get the idea.
When President Obama met with Pope Francis in 2015, he gave him a key to the house of the first American woman who was canonized as a saint. When Queen Elizabeth caught up with His Holiness the year before that, she offered a basket full of food from the royal estates, including a nice bottle of whiskey. And when Mark Zuckerberg met with him on Monday, August 29, in the year of our lord Harambe, he gave him … a drone.
And not even a real drone, which might have been fun for the Pope to use and roam around Vatican City spying on the Swiss Guard. No, Zuckerberg offered up a model of the Aquila, Facebook’s massive drone designed to beam internet to people who might otherwise not have access. (Okay, sure, it’s a fairly cool project.)
“We [Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan] also discussed the importance of connecting people, especially in parts of the world without internet access,” Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Facebook. “It was a meeting we’ll never forget. You can feel his warmth and kindness, and how deeply he cares about helping people.”
Update, 1:24 p.m. ET: Turns out you should always believe every rumor you hear, because Apple indeed did start sending out official invites for the iPhone 7’s unveiling on September 7. You can see one of the official invites below (notice how the bokeh’ed lights form the top of the Apple logo). The Bill Graham Civic Auditorium is also the same place that Apple held their keynote last year. Here’s the page on Apple’s website where the livestream will be held, starting 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET.
If you were a kid in the ‘90s (or just very in touch with your inner child in the ‘90s), chances are you owned a pair of light-up shoes. They pretty much ruled the playground, but they also had some fatal flaws: They only lit up when you walked, the lights weren’t all that bright, and eventually, they would die. But it looks like light-up technology has made some significant advancements in the past two decades.
The facts, such as they are: On August 10, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman announced the Apple would unveil the phone on Wednesday, September 7. A few weeks before that, VentureBeat reporter and pretty accurate leaker Evan Blass said Apple would be releasing the phone on Friday, September 16. Since Apple releases phones about ten to 14 days after their keynote, all signs seem pointed towards a September 7 keynote — a fact that’s now essentially been taken as gospel by the small ecosystem of sites that live and die by Apple rumors.
Eight days wouldn’t be the closest Apple has ever cut it — see in 2013, where they announced the keynote for the iPhone 5s just seven days before the keynote. But compared to the long lead times from official event announcement to the actual event in 2014 and 2015, this does seem a bit out of the ordinary. (For what it’s worth, I’ve heard from two people in the tech industry that both doubt Apple will hit the September 7 keynote date.)
So, here’s my prediction: If official invites and announcements aren’t sent out by the end of today, Apple is pushing back its announcement to September 14.
Again, none of this is earth-shattering news. If Apple chooses to hold its keynote September 14, people will still watch it closely. This will not hurt Apple’s sales in the slightest — preorders will still come rolling in.
There are other handset manufacturers that would run a schoolbus full of children and puppies off a cliff just to get a modicum of the heat an Apple keynote produces. The fact that there’s active speculation about when we’ll get to watch a 160-minute-long commercial for Apple products shows how much the iPhone itself still defines “smartphones” in the public imagination (even if Android dominates the actual smartphone OS market).
There are many ways of looking at “the gig economy” — the idea that people will make money in the future by picking up short-term, project, or shift work as necessary — but the two most prominent are as follows:
1) The gig economy gives people greater flexibility and choice in how and when they earn money, allows them to put assets like cars and houses to use, and gives them a vast array of chances to supplement their other income.
2) The gig economy represents the mass adoption of exploitative labor practice that deny workers compensation, benefits, stability, or the ability to plan for a future. It is a house of cards propped up by extravagant promises and VC funding.
I lean toward that second option, but that doesn’t really mean anything, because we’re going to get the gig economy whether we want it or not. Bloomberg has a great piece about the complex app ecosystem for the gig economy: apps that help workers juggle the multiple obligations that themselves were facilitated by apps. Snagajob, an HR startup, has snagged (lol) $1.2 billion in venture capital funding so far.
“What we are really building our business on is the blurring of the line between snagging a job and snagging a shift,” CEO Peter Harrison said.
The rise of the gig economy is complicated and overdetermined, but it plays on recent economic and technological themes: the precarious position of low-wage workers, the concentration of money in the upper reaches of income distribution, the increasing sophistication of logistical software, and the concurrent reliance on markets of various kinds to make determinations in nearly all fields of human endeavor. The gig economy makes sense to tech startups because it can be built on top of ever-more-elaborate software.
There is a devious sort of vocabulary around these sorts of startups. From Bloomberg’s report:
Thanks to the gig economy, workers have even greater freedom to be treated as tools.
Gig startups like Uber aren’t cheap because they have a better business model, they’re cheap because they’ve got money to burn. Tech companies in the gig economy are spending their ways into normalcy. And then apps like Snagajob are stacking themselves on top of those already volatile companies.
Uber is extremely popular, but it also lost more than a billion dollars in the first half of this year. Its fares are cheaper because it uses investors’ money to subsidize drivers. For that matter, Uber is also in the midst of a huge class-action lawsuit over whether its drivers do in fact qualify as employees (a judge recently threw out a proposed settlement in the case, calling it unfair).
But just because the gig economy “makes sense” doesn’t mean it works. Shady pricing has placed an entire subset of on-demand apps like Postmates and DoorDash, which rely on couriers, under scrutiny for making offerings seem more affordable than they really are. On-demand startups are predicated on the idea of becoming a habit, not a luxury.
The past few weeks have been a roller coaster of emotions for anybody following Justin Bieber on Instagram. After a drama-filled fight with Selena Gomez, Bieber deactivated his account on the platform. And the teens (and I) wept.
But earlier today, Bieber made his return to Instagram, prompting cheers and headlines like “Justin Bieber is back on Instagram, so everyone can finally relax now,” and “Justin Bieber Has Re-activated His Instagram Account, the World Rejoices.” Except, at least according to Bieber on Twitter, the whole thing was a mistake.
Close observers immediately speculated that Bieber’s dramatic return was an attempt to bring the focus of the public away from the VMAs and back to himself. But in Bieber’s defense: It’s very easy to accidentally re-enable your Instagram account.
Perhaps Bieber was just logging on to take a stroll down Instagram memory lane or to take a screenshot of one of the many selfies he has shared over the years. Whatever the cause, it doesn’t seem like we should be expecting the man who once abandoned a monkey in Germany to be posting anything new anytime soon.
Temporarily disabling your Instagram account is a multi-step process that can only be done on a desktop. Once a user finishes the process, they are informed that the next time they log into Instagram, their account will once again be live. (Note: You have to wait a few hours from disabling your account before you can bring it back online. Which I just learned while testing this process out in the name of journalism.) So while it’s somewhat difficult to temporarily disable your account, reactivating your account (like Bieber accidentally did this morning) is, by comparison, quite simple.
There’s something curious going on right now with the iPhone 7 rollout. Granted, you may only care about this if you’re the type of person who not only follows rumors about the next iPhone, but also about when it’ll actually be announced (which is deeply sad and also, hi! — we usually have a little meet-up on Thursdays and Bryan makes a decent seven-layer bean dip).
If you glanced at Twitter or Facebook trends this weekend (or even into today), you might have noticed “McChicken” topping the list. McChicken? you might be thinking, wholesomely. Who doesn’t love the delicious McDonald’s breaded-chicken sandwich? No wonder it’s trending! Hmm. Not to burst your bubble, but “McChicken” was trending because some guy filmed himself, um, well, having sex with a McChicken Sandwich. The internet proceeded to set itself on fire.

5. This YouTuber who built a working freeze ray in his backyard.
Get out of the road, dog! There’s a rally race going on, right this very second, on the road you are walking on!
Dog!
Hey!
Dog, move!
The car is approaching, dog, you better do something. Dog, you gotta get out of the way! I can hear the car.
Doooooog!
Instead, here are seven alternative videos you can watch to fill your dragging Monday afternoon, none of which involve some schmuck copulating with fast food.
If you’re just starting to realize that Netflix’s Stranger Things may not be back on the air (“air”) until well into President Trump’s first term, and need something to tide you over, there’s this fan-made point-and-click adventure, made by Steven Alexander, James Mulvale, and Jon Taylor-Stoll of Infamous Quests. In it you play Chief Jim Hopper, seemingly slightly drunk and taking constant smoke breaks, as you begin to look into the disappearance of Will Byers.
The game should be instantly recognizable to anyone who played the early-’90s LucasArts classics like The Secret of Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, or Sam & Max Hit the Road. (Our only criticism would be that the game’s pixel graphics are a bit too advanced for 1983, back when stuff like King’s Quest was seen as cutting edge.) Click to look at things, talk to people, and examine objects. There’re some clever nods to the show, such as this little exchange with science teacher Mr. Clarke.
After finding the drainpipe where (spoiler if you haven’t seen Stranger Thing, though if you haven’t seen Stranger Things I’m very curious why you’re still reading this) Eleven makes her escape from Hawkins Labs, Chief Hopper takes a peek inside.
With the drainpipe explored, Chief Hopper decides it’s time to head back to the station and hope Flo has made some coffee — it’s gonna be a long one. This is also the end of the game; Infamous Quests seem to have simply done this more as proof-of-concept and labor of love than trying to re-create the entire world of Stranger Things.
And that’s the end of Stranger Things. Nothing left to see here, may as well check your e-ma — aw Christ!
Undetected concussions are a problem among contact-sport athletes and may lead to Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, and brain damage. That’s why a team of students at Texas Tech University are using technology developed by NASA to create a smart football helmet that could make concussions much easier to diagnose and treat.
All high-schooler Jillian Henry wanted was to stand in the Willamette River near her hometown in Eugene, Oregon, and take a few tasteful pictures to commemorate her senior year. Instead, what she got were 24,000 retweets and a brush with viral fame after a nude dude and his dog wound up in the background of some of the shots.
“So my friend Elena Nesbit took the pictures, and we were taking some in the water when we realized he was a few spots down, naked, and we started laughing so hard,” Henry told me via Twitter DM.
“It’s a very popular swim spot, so I’m surprised he was there, because we weren’t the only people around,” Henry said. “But we also weren’t completely shocked because we live in Eugene and that type of thing isn’t entirely uncommon.” Unfamiliar with Oregonian towns, I asked for a little more detail about what she meant. “Eugene is kinda known as a hippie town, so it’s not surprising to see that kinda thing here, I guess,” she explained. “A lot of people have been saying it’s ‘Classic Eugene.’” Ah, yes, classic Eugene.
Following a three-year investigation, the European Commission announced on Tuesday that it had found that Apple received “selective tax treatment” from Ireland and ordered the tech giant to repay 13 billion euros to the country. The amount, equivalent to $14.5 billion, is a significantly higher cost than Apple is used to paying Ireland, which taxed the iPhone maker at rates as low as 0.005 percent. The standard corporate tax rate in Ireland is 12.5 percent, though many tech companies use it as a haven for business in Europe.
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager laid out how Apple managed to avoid corporate taxation. “Whether you buy your iPhone in Berlin or Rome, you contractually buy it from Apple Sales International in Cork,” she said. Apple Sales International is a stateless corporation which, according to Vestager, exists only on paper and has no employees. Payments using money from sales in Europe are then sent back to the mothership in California to finance research and development.
Both Apple and Ireland have pushed back against the ruling. Ireland has said it will appeal the ruling, stating, “Ireland’s position remains that the full amount of tax was paid in this case and no State aid was provided. Ireland did not give favourable tax treatment to Apple. Ireland does not do deals with taxpayers.”
In a letter to customers, Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed a similar sentiment in an open letter published this morning.
To clarify, nobody is saying that Apple didn’t pay what it owed. The EU is saying that Ireland gave Apple an unfairly low tax rate as state aid.
The U.S. Treasury Department expressed similar disappointment at the EU’s ruling. The appeal will likely take years, and the final amount Apple will owe, if any, remains up in the air. As of last month, Apple had $232 billion in cash, $214 billion of which was held overseas.
Cook’s primary line of defense is that the EU is trying to collect taxes on a company that is creating value outside its borders. “A company’s profits should be taxed in the country where the value is created,” he wrote. “Apple, Ireland and the United States all agree on this principle.”
Back in my day, if you wanted to get out of taking a test, you faked sick and hoped for the best. But in 2016, teens are a lot more tech savvy. So when faced with the looming prospect of college entrance exams, one 17-year-old Sri Lankan student decided to take matters into his own hands, by hacking President Maithripala Sirisena’s website. Which, believe it or not, didn’t end well for him.
Kim anonymized her account, not naming the start-up and changing names (nevertheless, the start-up itself was swiftly identified; more on that in a minute). The company she worked for was another job-search site, self-described as “the Credit Karma of LinkedIn” (always a good sign when you need to describe yourself using two already-existent companies). The two men running the company, Michael and Charlie, recruited Kim, and she moved from Dallas to SF, having been promised a signing bonus. Before she started, the company hired an underling without her input who, in her opinion, immediately started gunning for Kim’s job.
Start-ups can be difficult places to work: long hours, small paychecks, high stress, and the ever-looming prospect of sudden collapse. But even regular start-up work sounds like a union 9-to-5 compared to the story of Penny Kim.
That’s a bad experience, but not entirely abnormal. Where it really started to go off the rails is when Kim talked to co-workers following a missed paycheck and another one paid with a cashier’s check:
The story was widely circulated on Monday, and on the popular start-up discussion forum Hacker News commenters identified the likely real-life startup as WrkRiot — formerly known as JobSonic, and 1for.one before that (archived pages back this up).
Last night, WrkRiot made the decision to publicly address the matter on their Facebook page, inadvertently confirming that the saga was about them. Stating that it was considering legal action against an unnamed Kim, it said, in part:
The post concluded, “Further, we want to make it clear that we will seek any and all legal remedies to end this campaign of slander.” Here’s the first legal tip: The blog post, if defamatory, would technically be libel.
Lord knows I am not a “business man,” but it strikes me that a company where the CEO borrows $50,000 from an employee may not be on the soundest footing.
“The attacker had removed the home page and replaced it with a demand that the president postpone the ongoing GCE Advanced Level examinations or step down,” The Guardian reports. According to the BBC, the hacker (or hackers) operated under the group name Sri Lanka Youth. Police later traced the crime back to one unnamed teen, who was promptly arrested and now faces punishments including a $2,000 fine and up to three years in jail. The website was later re-hacked that same week. Which makes me think the Sri Lankan government’s IT department might need to put in some overtime.
On Sunday evening, Kim, a former marketing director at an unnamed San Francisco start-up, posted a lengthy recollection of a summer from hell. In the span of a few months, she had been recruited to work at a nascent tech start-up, experienced deceptive management practices, run into payroll issues, and allegedly encountered outright fraud.
After hassling her boss about her missing paycheck and bonus for days, Kim says that Michael emailed each employee a receipt for a Wells Fargo wire transfer for their paycheck. The only problem was that in the footer of the receipt, Kim found a copyright dated “1995–2014,” which seemed to indicate that Michael had forged personalized receipts for more than a dozen employees — many of whom were on H–1B visas. She found the likely template with a quick Google search.
Before today, creating a custom Snapchat geofilter (you know, the temporary, geofenced picture overlays that say things like “Congrats on turning 39 again, Judy!” on them) required a decent level of computer knowledge. You had to Photoshop your own PNG and submit it to Snapchat for approval. But now, Snapchat has a new web tool that will allow anyone to create and submit filter designs, without using a secondary program.
Using the new tool, Snapchatters will be able to log in on the Snapchat website and design a filter from a number of preset options. Events are labeled by category like “Birthdays” and “Weddings” to make things easier. From there, users will be able to customize text and color and submit. Users will also have to select the area and length of time they want their filter to run. (Pricing starts at $5 and goes on up from there.) If none of the pre-designed filters are doing it for you, you still have the option to submit your own design. (Either way, filters take a business day to process, so don’t wait till the last minute.)
According to a Snapchat spokesperson, people view snaps with geofilters more than a billion times each day. A number that is likely to go up now that a pastel-colored “CONGRATS” written in Comic Sans is just two clicks and $15 away from being at every wedding, bar mitzvah, and funeral you attend this year. Can’t wait for next week, when Instagram inevitably introduces an identical feature.
On Monday, London comedian Hannah Warman decided to take an Uber home. She opened up the app, agreed to 1.4x surge pricing, and ordered a car. When it arrived, she hopped in expecting a quick ride to her destination. Except Warman fell asleep during the ride. And when she checked her receipt the next day, it showed her driver had taken a roundabout way back to her home and what would have been a “five minute walk” took an hour and a half by car.
According to Warman’s tweet, the circuitous route to her home added an extra 35 miles and cost $111, she told Mashable. “I was shocked and upset about how expensive it was because I thought the driver must’ve got lost,” she said. “Then I realised he couldn’t have got that lost because they have Sat Navs and the map with the start and end point would’ve been in front of him. It looks like he went the longest way around possible.” Uber has since refunded Warman for the ride. (The company did not immediately respond to Select All’s request for comment.) Moral of the story: Don’t fall asleep in an Uber. (Second moral of the story: Always read your receipts.)
After he caught all the Pokémon available to him in the U.S., Pokémaster Nick Johnson received a trip sponsored by Expedia and Marriott Rewards to go and acquire the remaining three. And thank goodness he did, because can you imagine how annoying it would be to be perpetually stuck with 142 of the 145 existing Pokémon and no possible way to get them, save for spending several thousands of dollars of your own money on airfare? Life is just nuts, isn’t it.
Last week, Facebook fired the humans who were curating and writing the small list of “trending topics” that appears in the upper right of the Facebook homepage. That list, meant to show users what other people on the network are “talking about,” is now (according to Facebook) entirely assembled by software, supervised by humans who will correct whatever mistakes it makes. How’s that going so far? Let’s ask Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, whose name was trending over the weekend because she was “kicked out” of Fox News “for supporting Hillary,” according to a blog post on a website called “EndingTheFed.com,” which Facebook’s new “trending” process saw fit to highlight. I hate to cast aspersions on EndingTheFed.com, but the report was not true, and was quietly removed.
The Trending widget has always been a weird and little-loved feature, a living monument to Facebook’s inability (or refusal) to reconcile its status as a publisher with an enormous amount of power in shaping people’s perceptions of the world with its understanding of itself as a completely neutral platform whose priorities are set and decisions made by complex algorithms processing terabytes of data. On the one hand, Facebook was simply serving up topics that many people were recently “talking about” on the network — as a neutral platform might. On the other, it was employing a staff of nearly 20 people actively selecting among those topics, determining which reached a threshold of credibility, and writing summaries — as a newspaper might.
Nowhere was this tension more apparent than in the small summaries that accompanied each item on the list, conspicuously formal and rigorously “neutral” straitjackets for the weird bits of gossip, outrage, humor, and video-game or comic-book movie announcements that actually trended. Reading the summaries — “Jake Gyllenhaal and Rooney Mara: Actors Reportedly Seen Taking a Walk Together in New York City”; “Garlic Bread Memes: Facebook Page Posts Image Criticized as Transphobic”; “Justin Timberlake: Singer Referenced Facebook Meme” — was like entering some parallel universe in which the condescendingly colloquial headline style that’s ubiquitous in our universe had never been adopted. It seemed as though Facebook was trying to reverse-engineer the studied objectivity it imagined real journalism entailed; in that sense, at least, Trending was an utterly engrossing project, a fascinating performance of “neutrality” by one of the world’s most powerful businesses and a small glimpse into Facebook’s own understanding of how media “works.”
Still: That just made it a curiosity, not a success. Those summaries are gone now, along with their authors, replaced by raw numbers — “Avicii: 76K people talking about this”; “Ice Road Truckers: 21K people talking about this.” The new Trending topics are, at least, appealingly transparent. Before, Trending could take on unearned weight simply by appearing prominently in the front-page box — “everyone’s talking about McChicken!” Now it’s clear that only 9,000 people, smaller than a rounding error to Facebook’s billion-strong user base, are “talking about” “McChicken” on Facebook. (For the record, they are “talking about” a viral video of a guy, uh, penetrating a McDonald’s McChicken sandwich.)
Facebook fired its editors, we can assume, because it wanted to eliminate the human decision-making that will necessarily lead to claims of bias and suppression. But in removing the thin veneer of context provided by its sentence summaries Facebook leaves bare the real problem with Trending: On its own, it’s useless. That a particular phrase is trending on Facebook is not an inherently interesting fact. The how or the why might be interesting — but explaining would be a publisher’s job, not a platform’s. That “7.1K people [are] talking about” Mary Shelley, or that “1K people [are] talking about” Google Contacts is not information that serves me even as a diversion.
The best thing about virtual reality? The fact that we can now (sort of) live out our wildest fantasies. If pretending to be an artist isn’t your bag, maybe try being a rock star on for size. Though to be fair, this looks like more of a game than an actual music-production tool, so don’t let it go to your head too much. And definitely don’t quit your day job.
Twitter announced today that it will start offering creators the ability to run ads alongside their videos, and receive a significant portion of the ad revenue as a result. According to Recode, Twitter users that are part of the program will get 70 percent of the ad revenue, a significant step up from the 55 percent that YouTube offers.
The catch is that Twitter’s revenue split only applies to video posted on Twitter. It doesn’t apply to Vine or Periscope (which Twitter owns), nor is there a way to display ads and thus earn revenue on other types of content, like text or photos. If you’re a “Twitter comedian” (lol) who posts funny one-liners, there’s still no way to monetize that through a first-party option — you’re SOL.
At the very least, this will encourage popular users to post video natively on Twitter in addition to other channels (the content does not have to be exclusive to Twitter). But it’s also unclear whether Twitter is equipped to handle video publishing as a business. Introducing money into the mix makes video publishing, and issues like copyright and fair use, incredibly thorny. Currently, nobody can monetize their work on Twitter directly through Twitter; it’s a relatively freewheeling, copyright-eschewing sector of the internet. Does that change going forward?
But the new widget eliminates both the lobotomized affect that gave Trending its stunted charm, and also whatever small sense of context could be gathered from the summaries. These new Trending topics are robotic to the extreme, baffling and alien and utterly uninterested in decipherability. Why are 11,000 people “talking about” Mila Kunis? Your guess is as good as mine: Clicking through the link reveals a smattering of different, unrelated posts, including a video of the credits to That ‘70s Show. “1M people [are] talking about” Apple Inc.: I mean, sure. Why wouldn’t they be? So?
Worse, the Trending widget compromises itself, creating a feedback loop as more people “talk about” the things they see people are “talking about.” Ultimately Trending becomes an exercise in reflexive information distribution, based on the assumption that data is useful in and of itself — that because Facebook can tell you that a certain number of people are talking about something, it should. But that’s not just useless, it’s worse than useless. Data needs interpretation. By firing its editors, by refusing to empower them to explain and interpret, Facebook doomed its project to pointlessness: a lobotomized newswire with no context, no new information, and no real reason to exist.
A week after word of their narrow escape from the treacherous city of Chicago made headlines, married teen YouTubers Brianna Joy and Jaelin White are back with a new video entitled “REACTING TO PRESS AND HATE.”
In the video, the couple addresses their recent media coverage in “Reddit, New York Magazine, The Daily Mail, and all that other kinda stuff.” “A lot of those people don’t understand our story, so it’s easy to hate us,” Jaelin explains. (For the record, I do not hate the Whites! Like their hundred of thousands of YouTube followers, I find them fascinating.)
Jaelin and Brianna would like to make it known that they harbor “no hard feelings toward Chicago.” (Based on the reactions of many of the city’s residents, I’m not sure the same thing can be said for the city’s feelings towards them.) They also recommend that you do not attend the Brianna and Jaelin Walking Tour on September 6, a Facebook event that promises to highlight all the major points from their escape route, including Chipotle and Subway. To quote Jaelin: “These trolls will literally find any way to make themselves look funny.”
Mostly, these teens would just like people to stop talking about the whole thing.“This is something that happened, and it wasn’t a big deal,” Brianna Joy explains. “It’s like a month since we posted the video, and a month later I don’t want to keep talking about this.” (Because there is nothing like drawing attention to something again, in order to get people to forget all about it.) As of publishing this story, Brianna and Jaelin’s reaction video had 13,000 views and counting. The OG Chicago video is just shy of 1.5 million.
This afternoon, the auspicious URL drakeandrihanna.com briefly set social media alight with the tantalizing possibility of a collaboration — or wedding (???) — to be revealed at the end of a slowly moving countdown. Sadly, the dream was extinguished when Drake and Rihanna’s reps denied any involvement. So we set to work trying to figure out who was behind it.
In addition, Drake’s site and his OVO domain use GoDaddy as a registrar. If Drake was the person who set up the site, it’s not insane to believe that he would probably have used GoDaddy again. Instead, drakeandrihanna.com was registered through 1API, “one of Europe’s leading domain name registrars.” The domain rihannaanddrake.com was also registered through them today within minutes of drakeandrihanna.com.
Start by considering the WHOIS records. Every domain registered creates a WHOIS record with the internet authority ICANN. The record for drakeandrihanna.com indicates that it was registered earlier today. Even in the age of the surprise album drop, setting up an entire site — even one as basic the countdown site — would be a stretch. Musicians plan these releases more than a day in advance.
There are other markers of sloppiness. Take the Javascript on the page:
On top of that, let’s compare that WHOIS record to Drake and Rihanna’s official website records. The information, such as the name and address of the owners are protected, so it’s not much use. But both Rihanna and Drake’s sites use anonymizing services located in the United States. The fake site does not. That should engender some skepticism.
The countdown is supposed to end on September 8 at 9 p.m. This would make sense on the West Coast, where Drake and Rihanna are, because that’s midnight, September 9, on the East Coast. But accessing the site on the East Coast shows that the countdown will still end at 9 p.m. on September 8. That’s because Javascript uses whatever your computer’s clock is set to, meaning the countdown would end at 9 p.m. regardless of time zone. Sloppy again, but not a smoking gun.
Why on earth would a prank site need Google Analytics? It’s because someone wants to track the traffic to the site. That’s a telltale sign that the site was created by a company, possibly a marketing firm. Certainly by someone with a likely commercial interest. Curious!
And then we get to Google Analytics.
The second-to-last line in that code includes something called a GaID, an identification number for the Google Analytics account holder. It’s “UA–66332030–30.” Here’s how it works, according to Google.
In other words, if one Google account holder wanted to monitor traffic on multiple domains that they own, the string “UA–66332030” would appear across different sites.
The first two results were for the website of Super Deluxe, a comedy site that employs people like Vine auteur Vic Berger. They do a ton of social-media stunts, like when they created Yeezus2020.com (which also has the GaID).
So I Googled it.
Sharing a GaID is a smoking gun. The only reason that completely discrete sites would share an ID is if a third-party had been sloppy in setting it up. A competent web admin would make sure that they establish an Analytics account that only their employer or client could access. Two different entities sharing one Google Analytics account would be a huge oversight, especially for Super Deluxe, which is owned by a major broadcaster, Turner.
In addition, according to WHOIS records, superdeluxe.com and drakeandrihanna.com were both registered through 1API, the overseas domain registrar mentioned before.
It was enough of a smoking gun to contact Super Deluxe — though as soon as we emailed, the true auteur behind the site was revealed: Joanne the Scammer (birth name Branden Miller), who recorded a video announcing, well … we’ll let her explain:
As anyone who visits the site now will see, the people behind it were internet legend Joanne the Scammer and comedy website Super Deluxe, who replaced the mysterious countdown with a video of Joanne shortly after Select All emailed for comment. For the sake of helping future Aubrih detectives, though, let’s walk through our detective work.
Three years after it launched, Washio, the Uber for laundry, is closing its doors. (Or its lid? If its a top-loader.) As per a letter posted to the company website today, “no more orders will be accepted and outstanding orders will be returned promptly to customers.”
Since 2013, Washio dry cleaned over one million items of clothing and washed and folded over 21,000 tons of laundry, the letter also explains of the former 24-hour laundry on demand startup. It also inspired this truly bonkers profile of the company’s founders Jordan Metzner, Bob Wall, and Juan Dulanto:
Sadly, it looks like laundry wound up demolishing Washio in the end, instead of the other way around. (Though a cryptic section in Washio’s farewell address – “We are not alone in believing in Washio’s core business, technology and team, and hope it lives on in some shape or form in the future. But, that story has yet to be told…” – leaves us some hope for a brighter and better starched tomorrow.)
The following features are pretty much assured. Apple never, ever comments on its phones before they debut, but if any of these things don’t happen, I’ll be shocked.
Say good-bye to the 3.5mm headphone jack, which has been around for over five decades. If you use an iPhone 7, you’ll listen to music over Bluetooth or through the same Lightning port that you use to charge your phone.
No Headphone Jack on the iPhone 7
It’s tempting to say this will be like when iPhone 5 owners were forced to ditch all their old chargers for Lightning ones. People complained, but the switch was eventually made without damage to Apple’s iPhone sales. But chargers are largely stationary items — you keep one at your desk, one by your bedside, maybe one for the kitchen or living room. Maybe you carry an extra charger in your bag, just in case, but even then you’re likely charging it from a wall outlet.
Still, Apple has been at the forefront of removing ports when they deem them no longer necessary. They got rid of CD-DVD drives years before others, and continue to remove ports from their laptops if they consider them extraneous. It’s certainly within the realm of possibility that, by 2018, the idea that we constantly had cords running from our ears to our phones will seem just as silly as the idea of loading a program onto your computer from 17 CDs.
The Plus Model Remains
Headphones are for everywhere and are meant to be mobile. Finding yourself without a pair while on the subway or while on a run can be as painful as forgetting your keys at home, and wireless headphones have the nasty habit of running out of battery life at the worst times. Apple will almost certainly include a pair of wireless earbuds with the iPhone (amusingly called, per regulatory filings, “Air Buds”), but this will make billions of headphones with 3.5 mm jacks largely useless for iPhone 7 users (there are adapters, but they seem, ah, not ideal). Unless Apple also rolls out a new touchscreen that will give you a small but quite painful electric shock every time you touch it in the wrong way, this is going to be the most controversial part of the new iPhone.
There were early rumors that Apple may end the bifurcation of the iPhone into a regular model and a plus model, but it now seems all but certain that an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 7 Plus will both be offered. Current leaked specs show the regular iPhone 7 with a 4.7-inch display, and an iPhone Plus with a 5.5-inch display. The specs for both roughly mirror what you see in the current iPhone 6s versus iPhone 6s Pluses — more battery, more RAM, better camera — all at a higher price.
Apple isn’t the first to market with this idea — the HTC M8, the LG G5, and others have done dual-mounted cameras before — but the invitation that Apple sent out offers a good idea of what they see as the main advantage of having two cameras on the back of your phone.
The iPhone 7 Plus Will Have Dual Rear-Facing Cameras
No Other Major Form Factor Changes
Every leaked photo shows that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are going to largely continue on with the rounded edges that we saw reintroduced in the iPhone 6, after a few generations of sharper edges. The iPhone 7 is going to be a lot more powerful than the previous generation — the iPhone 7 Plus is rumored to carry a hefty 3GB of RAM and an A10 processor, which doesn’t place it at the top of the market, but also makes it no slouch — but they won’t look significantly different than the current generation.
The bokeh effect (which is just a fancy term for lights that are out of focus and give that pleasant, hazy feel you see in films and pro photographers’ pictures) means that photos taken with the iPhone 7 Plus are about to take a big leap forward. If you can pull off bokeh, it usually means you have a pricey camera capable of tightly focusing on one object and leaving everything else in that filmic blur. Having spent some time with LG’s G5’s dual cameras, I can testify that the two cameras make it much easier to pull off shots like that, plus take crisp and clear low-light photos, take wide-angle shots, and even do zoomed-in snaps that won’t make your pics look like they were taken with a Motorola RAZR circa 2005.
These are the things that are up in the air. Leaks seem to indicate these will make their way to stage, but leaks have been wrong before. Still, there’s a fair chance we’ll see these on Wednesday.
No More Drying Off Your iPhone With Rice
When Apple announced the iPhone 4 would come in both black and white, it was major news. By the time the iPhone 6 came out there were four color options: silver, space-gray, gold, and rose-gold. But new leaked shots show that Apple may be switching things up: space-gray will be replaced by a matte space-black, while a fifth option, a glossy black finish, will be added. (There were earlier rumors of a navy option, which, frankly, looked a lot cooler, but the latest leaks all point toward glossy black.) Why bother protecting your $700 investment with a case when you’ve got a glossy black finish to show off?
It’s been an open secret that both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s are pretty water-resistant, able to withstand dunks that would have destroyed an iPhone 4. Thanks to an eliminated headphone jack and some upgraded charging standards, the new iPhone 7 may be fully waterproof. This would allow Apple to finally catch up to many Android phones — the press materials for the Samsung Note 7 practically demand that you drench it in water to show off how waterproof it is. And even if you don’t care about smartphone rivalry, actual, official waterproofing would be a welcome relief to many, many iPhone customers who have lost a phone thanks to a spilled coffee or a slip near the sink.
So Long, 16 GB
As the size of iOS has increased, a 16 GB phone has made less and less sense. Yes, you can back up your photos to iCloud or a similar service, but when almost a third of your storage space is taken up by your OS, and four episodes of a podcast can eat up 1 GB, nearly every gadget geek will tell you to stay away from 16 GB models. Some early prototype stickers show that Apple may agree, and that the base model of the iPhone 7 will start at 32 GB.
As popularized by @THEKIDMERO and @DesusNice, a.k.a. the creators of the best podcast ever, the Bodega Boys, these are the things that technically could happen — like you finally recording that mixtape or perfecting your crossover-to-fade-away jumper and making the Knicks warm-up squad — but probably won’t happen. But hey, even a broken watch with an eight ball and some serious debt is right twice a day, so who knows?
Going Pro
Saving the 7
Early rumors suggested that Apple wasn’t going to offer just a regular iPhone 7 and an iPhone 7 Plus, but also an iPhone 7 Pro, which would have been the same size as the Plus, but packing some extra processing power, maybe a better camera, and a “Smart Connector,” as seen in iPad Pros, that allows you to set up a Bluetooth keyboard and Bluetooth mice quickly — the idea being that Apple’s phablets could become an on-the-go computer, able to tackle a lot of stuff we still need laptops for. But no recent leaks seem to indicate that this is coming down the pike. There’s always a chance it could be the “one more thing,” but we’re guessing that if the Pro model does come, it’ll come in 2017.
Some have suggested that because the leaked pictures of the upcoming phones look so similar, Apple would save the iPhone 7 name for 2017, and instead keep the line under iPhone 6 but add some special designation to let people know these were the really, really good new phones. But this goes against nearly everything Apple has done to date — yearly updates are major steps forward, not iterative ones. And while the symmetry of releasing the iPhone 7 in 2017 may be appealing, Apple would risk confusing the market by releasing yet another version of the iPhone 6. Tim Cook & Co. will be onstage announcing the iPhone 7. Plus, if they wait until the iPhone turns ten, they could call it the iPhone X and probably do some cool product placement with the next X-Men movie. “Beast, I need you to set a timer for 15 minutes — but you can only use your voice,” Professor X will say. “Not a problem,” Beast will reply, before leaning in toward his iPhone X and accidentally setting a timer for 18 minutes. “Fucking Siri, you goddamn piece of shit. I said fucking 15 minutes,” Beast will say. (Our other #cokedreams prediction is that the next X-Men movie is gonna be a hard-R film.)
There were rumors that Apple — much like nearly every Android device out — would be removing the Home button in favor of an onscreen button with haptic feedback (i.e., it’ll make your phone buzz slightly when you touch it). But the latest spec leaks and photos all show the familiar circular divot we’ve seen since the beginning. The advantage of removing the Home button is simple: The Home button and the bezel around it all reduce screen size while doing nothing to reduce the actual size of the phone. But it’s more likely this will happen in 2017, during the tenth anniversary of the iPhone.
No Home Button
If you haven’t changed your password for Dropbox since mid-2012, you should do so now. Like, stop reading this and go do it.
If you’ve been on social media this week, you’re probably aware that San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick declined to stand up during the playing of the national anthem at a preseason game on Friday. Afterward, the quarterback said he was “not going to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.” It was not a move that endeared him to many of our country’s Republican Uncles and Aunts, and Facebook and Twitter have been flooded with angry responses from people accusing Kaepernick of disrespect.
As first reported by Motherboard and then confirmed by web-security expert Troy Hunt, hackers were able to grab emails and passwords for 60 million Dropbox users. The good news? The passwords were encrypted. The bad news? About half of them include the “salt,” a bit of random data generated on top of the password intended to make it even more difficult to see the raw password data. Without the salt, cracking passwords is very, very difficult. With the salt, it’s not. Hunt had changed his password in 2014, so while he found his records in the breach, he wasn’t worried about someone being able to get into his account. His wife, however, while using a strong password from 1Password, had not, and Hunt was able to quickly figure out the salt on her password. While actually cracking that password would still remain very, very difficult, it’s not impossible, especially for anyone using a relatively common password.
Earlier this week, Dropbox forced a number of password resets on users, related to a mid-2012 breach. It appears that those users were part of the 60 million users breached. Even if you didn’t get a forced password reset, if you’re still using “GoMets86!” for your Dropbox account and haven’t switched it up in the past four years, go do that. And if you use “GoMets86!” for a bunch of other services, particularly anything highly sensitive like personal email or bank accounts, go ahead and switch that over as well. (Also, stop using one password for every service, but you’ve probably already heard that.)
But just as Twitter can be a place for some of the world’s worst political discourse, it can also be a catalyst for some of its best. Take the hashtag #VeteransForKaepernick, which started trending on Tuesday and happens to be (and let me apologize for being earnest on the internet) quite moving — filled with simple expressions of positions that are more nuanced and thoughtful than any of the cable-news hosts or politicians who weighed in were able to articulate. Remember, would-be Limbaughs: Don’t use veterans as political props, because they’ve been thinking about their service for a lot longer than you have.
Dropbox had a somewhat similar security issues in 2014, though in that case the service claimed it was because of password reuse, not an actual data breach.
Five Different Color Options
Before today, if you wanted a closer look at an image posted on Instagram, there were several steps involved before you could commence creeping. You had to take a screenshot and then head to your phone’s camera roll to zoom in. (And zooming on a video involved the added step of screenshotting at the exact right moment. And when does that ever work on the first, second, or 30th try.) But now, Instagram is eliminating the need for those steps.
If you’re curious just how much of your personal data is out there, you can always check haveibeenpwned, which will check your email against known data breaches, though it hasn’t been updated with the 60 million accounts quite yet. It’s still instructive — I personally have been pwned five times, which is why my password is no longer “NobodyWillEverGuessThis!” for every service I use. It’s also a good reason to use something like 1Password or LastPass; remembering a strong password for every single different service you log in is, frankly, nearly impossible, and these services fix that problem. So even if your password for Adobe Cloud Services gets released into the wild, your Gmail account remains secure.
Users will now be able to use two fingers and pinch to zoom in on both photos and videos everywhere on the app. The feature is currently available on iOS, but Android owners will still have to wait a little bit longer.

A standard Netflix plan, which lets you view content on two different screens, will run you $10 per month. Upgrading to four screens will cost you an extra $2. Those prices have gone up slightly over the years, but Netflix might want to be careful if they consider raising them again. According to a new study from research firm Digitalsmiths, there’s a cap to what most people are willing to pay to binge-watch Stranger Things and Orange Is the New Black: $15.
Digitalsmiths found that for 40 percent of the 3,100 consumers they surveyed, a range between $12 and $15 was the sweet spot. Anything higher and people weren’t willing to pay. Additionally, 30 percent of people said they wouldn’t be willing to pay any more than they currently are for the streaming service, and 10 percent said they are currently using Netflix without paying.
Of course, Netflix’s CEO Reed Hastings has been very vocal about the fact that he doesn’t mind that users share Netflix passwords. (Although that probably has something to do with the fact that the company has started regulating the number of screens that can be used at one time on any given account.) So if the cost of an account gets too high for your liking, you can just continue stealing your shows from your parents, or ex-girlfriend’s parents, or that friend who still hasn’t changed their password after they loaned it to you to watch all seven seasons of Gilmore Girls back in 2014.
The most popular YouTube celebrity, video-game streamer PewDiePie, had his Twitter account briefly suspended and unverified this week after false chatter circulated that he had joined the Islamic State.
“Me and @Jack_Septic_Eye have joined isis. Which is why we both got unverified,” PewDiePie (real name: Felix Kjellberg) wrote shortly after retweeting a fake article about his pledging allegiance to the brutal caliphate sowing chaos across Syria and Iraq.
But PewDiePie did not join ISIS. He joins an exclusive list of celebs falsely rumored to have joined ISIS. Other members include “Same Love” rapper Macklemore.
Recruiting PewDiePie would have been a huge coup for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The influential gamer, who has more than 47 million YouTube subscribers, would have certainly given a serious boost to ISIS’s social media operation, which heavily leans on the web to address followers, recruit new members, and spread propaganda.
The Philadelphia Zoo gained another gorilla last week after 21-year-old Honi, a western lowland gorilla, gave birth. Today marks the baby gorilla’s public debut at the zoo, a historic moment as Honi’s baby is the first gorilla born at the zoo in 20 years, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
Honi, the baby, and the baby’s father (who is a 31-year-old named Motuba in case that matters to you) are all doing great, but the mother gorilla has been keeping the newborn too close for zookeepers to determine its sex yet. The baby’s sex is a factor that will be crucial during the zoo’s upcoming contest to name their newest gorilla. Yes, you read that right. The Philadelphia Zoo is willingly going to let strangers name the little guy or gal, the Philadelphia Inquirer also reports. And if these tweet replies are any indication, it’s pretty clear how that is going to turn out.
As a variation on a theme, I’d like to suggest Harambe McHarambeface.
Update: It appears the baby gorilla probably won’t be named Harambe after all.
Back in May, Facebook came under fire for what was described “suppressing conservative news” in its Trending widget. (That’s the small box on the right side with “trending” topic names, until recently curated and summarized by a small team of editors.) “Among the deep-sixed or suppressed topics,” Gizmodo’s Michael Nuñez wrote at the time, were “former IRS official Lois Lerner, who was accused by Republicans of inappropriately scrutinizing conservative groups; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker; popular conservative news aggregator the Drudge Report; Chris Kyle, the former Navy SEAL who was murdered in 2013; and former Fox News contributor Steven Crowder.”
So, somehow, Facebook has gone from having a problem “suppressing” conservative news to having a problem allowing fake news. I wonder if those two things are related?
The Kelly story promoted over the weekend is just one small example of the kind of content pumped out regularly by a large and lucrative Facebook ecosystem of right-wing political pages, explored in detail in The New York Times Magazine last week. This is the world of pages with names like The American Patriot, pushing highly emotional stories with only a tenuous connection to the truth. These pages are successful because engagement on Facebook — especially on political Facebook, and especially in conservative political Facebook — is generally fueled more by a given post’s ability to stoke passion in its readers, rather than by old-fashioned qualities like “usefulness” or “accuracy,” and, generally speaking, the people running politics pages on Facebook are less concerned with communicating correct information as a public service than they are by ensuring their stories are “liked” and “shared” with enough frequency to make money. Put bluntly, there’s money to be made off of conservative outrage, and very little incentive to do so responsibly.
Last week, Facebook fired that team of curators — not unexpectedly, though the change was likely hastened by the controversy over conservative news — and replaced the human selection-and-summarization process with an automated sorting procedure overseen by a smaller team. Human bias eliminated! Except that the new Trending widget immediately found itself in hot water after it selected and highlighted an article from a site called End the Fed reporting that Megyn Kelly had been fired for backing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. That article, in turn, cited the similarly dubious website Conservative 101. None of it was true.
No news organization is perfect. Yes, I am aware of the New York Times’ reporting that launched the war in Iraq. I am aware that on an hourly basis every news website of a certain size and scale is screwing up in some way. But the distinctly Roger Ailesian technique of a sustained barrage of soundbites and catchphrases and unfounded speculation has been particularly characteristic of conservative-leaning media since long before social media started to matter in elections. In 2012, historian and author Rick Perlstein wrote about the uncomfortably close relationship between the contemporary conservative movement and the mail-order scams and pyramid schemes that prey on its most passionate believers.
A significant number of conservatives still believe that President Obama is not a natural-born citizen of the United States; as of 2015, one poll showed that 33 percent of Republicans still believe President Obama is a Muslim. The current Republican presidential candidate is estranged from facts entirely, and was no less successful in the Republican primary because of it.
Fox News and other mainstream conservative outlets know this as well as politicians do — it’s why Rudy Giuliani gets away with telling Fox News viewers to Google the phrase “Hillary Clinton illness,” and why Fox continues to chase theories about Benghazi, a trumped-up political fiasco that has long since been investigated and closed (don’t forget that it was the centerpiece of the first night of the Republican convention). When the most respectable conservative outlets steer so close to outright lying, you can imagine that their less accountable peers are driving directly into it.
At BuzzFeed, Craig Silverman writes that Facebook has fallen “into a fake news trap of its own making”:
The problem for Facebook is that the distance between fake news sites and the “conservative websites” they’ve been accused of suppressing is rail-thin. Each item in the list of topics Facebook was said to have been “suppressing” is a subject of as many wild conspiracy theories and hoaxes as newsworthy stories.
The act of suppressing conservative ideas connotes the promotion of liberal ones, but that isn’t really an accurate depiction of what happened at Facebook. Facebook’s problem isn’t that it suppresses “conservative news” or allows “fake news.” It’s that those two categories are increasingly indistinguishable.
But to acknowledge this would be to lose the thin, filmy sheen of neutrality under which Facebook inoculates itself. To exclude openly mendacious sites like Breitbart for being misleading or false opens the company up to accusations of bias. The responsibility of flagging false articles now falls on users. But Facebook is an echo chamber. The people reading the Daily Caller and the Blaze do so because they’re already onboard. They’re not going to tell anyone it’s fake. People see what they want to see and believe what they want to believe.

The trolley problem, a philosophical dilemma turned beloved internet meme, is pretty simple to understand, if difficult to solve. You have, of course, a trolley, which sits poised to diverge down one of two paths. On one side, there are five people strapped to the track. On the other there is only one. And you have to decide who dies and who lives.
It’s a question of right and wrong that traces back to the 1960s (with its meme origins popping up later, mostly via 4chan, in the late ‘00s). But now, more than 50 years later, a truly sage 2-year-old named Nicholas has finally solved the decades-old problem. The moment, documented by an adult Redditor and shared with the world via YouTube, has already racked up 2o,ooo video views and claimed the number one spot on Reddit’s front page.
Damn, Nicholas. That’s cold.
Update: This post initially stated that JobScore was one of the company’s former names. The name was actually JobSonic and has been corrected.
Last night, smartphone-maker Samsung confirmed to Reuters that it had delayed a number of shipments of its latest device, the Galaxy Note 7, after numerous reports of exploding batteries began to circulate.
The halt comes at a particularly bad moment, a week before Apple is set to announce its next phone. Samsung’s electronics division lost $7 billion in market value as a result, according to Reuters.
Shipments to South Korea’s three largest cell-phone companies have been delayed. Several Korean media outlets are reporting that Samsung plans to recall affected phones and replace their batteries.
Photos posted on the Chinese site Baidu show a charred device, though some commenters speculate that the fire stems from the use of a third-party charging cable.
A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket exploded during a static fire test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Thursday morning, the Associated Press reports. According to several people on Twitter who were in the area, the thick, black smoke from the explosion was visible off the base and one Floridian Twitter user even reported feeling vibrations from the blast from a nearby building.
Above all, there’s one thing you want out of your phone’s battery: the ability to hold as much power for as long as possible. Nobody wants a phone that can only last half a day off a full charge.
The explosion comes just days before the rocket was scheduled to launch the Amos 6 satellite for Israel’s Spacecom as part of Facebook’s Internet.org program. Once launched, the satellite will provide internet access to rural sections of sub-Saharan Africa.
There’s an incredibly pervasive myth that the best way to keep your battery healthy is to let it drain all the way to zero before recharging. Alas, like littering and the all-bread food pyramid, this is no longer considered a best practice. In fact, it’ll actually shorten the lifespan of your phone. Instead, to keep your battery healthy and ensure it’s able to maintain as much of a charge as possible, you want to give your phone regular charges — and avoid letting it get down to that 5 percent, everything all red, “Oh shit, how am I even gonna find the subway stop from here?” moment (easier said than done, I know).Why? Let’s see if it’s possible to explain without getting too wonky about battery tech. All modern cell phones’ lithium-ion batteries consist of, essentially, two sections: an anode (where all your power is stored) and a cathode (where all your energy goes to). In between them is a layer called the electrolyte (yes, the it’s the same name as the stuff Gatorade promises to replenish, but, trust me, these are very different). The anode is filled up with electrons. The cathode wants to suck up those electrons. The electrolyte makes it harder for those electrons to pass through, thus generating power. Think of it as a hydraulic power plant at the atomic level. When you plug your phone back in to charge it up, electrons flow back from the cathode into the anode.
So, why do lithium-ion batteries eventually lose their ability to hold as much of a charge? First off, if a lithium-ion battery ever falls to absolutely zero charge, it’ll actually never charge again. So when your phone is begging you to plug it in because it has 2 percent battery life left, it’s actually lying to you — it has more power than that, but if you were to use it all for one more Snapchat, you’d render the battery useless.
But more important, the ability of electrons to transfer smoothly between the anode and cathode degrades over time. Every time your phone battery goes to work, a layer of gunk (or, if you wanna get technical, “solid electrolyte interface”) builds up on the anode. The same happens to the cathode, with its gunk being called “electrolyte oxidation.” Both of these prevent the anode and cathode from being able to store as many electrons as before. Run enough cycles of depleting and then charging your phone, and eventually your battery stops being able to store many electrons at all, and your cell-phone battery starts to die after five hours, even after a 100 percent fill-up. This is why every lithium-ion battery is rated for a certain number of cycles. Nearly every consumer device, including your phone’s battery, comes in somewhere between 300 to 500 cycles.
So! What does all this have to do with why it’s better to give your phone regular top-offs instead of letting it drain to zero and then refilling to 100 percent? It all comes down to something called “depth of discharge” (which also is a very gross term if you think about it in the wrong way). Essentially, it means how much of your battery’s power you use before you start charging it again. What does this mean in real numbers? Over at Battery University, they broke down the number of cycles before you see degradation in a lithium-ion battery at different depths of discharge. When you consistently burn through 100 percent of your battery’s power, you’ll start to see your battery lose its ability to hold a charge after 300 to 500 cycles. But! If you use up only 50 percent of your battery before plugging it back into a charge, you can go 1,200 to 1,500 cycles before your battery starts to go into decline.
What’s more, if have the inclination to really micromanage your battery charging, it’s better to charge nearly, but not all the way, to 100 percent. Being charged at 100 percent produces a small amount of heat, and lithium-ion batteries hate heat.Granted, this is a tremendous amount of work. It’s much easier to simply charge up overnight, not think about your phone during the day, and plug it back in at the end of the day. If you want to split the difference, aim for trying to not let your phone get below 50 percent as much as possible. Charging it to 100 percent will have a much more negligible effect on how long your battery will continue to hold enough power to get you through the day.
Curious how you could pull off the “never below 50 percent” trick? We’ve got a rundown of external phone battery packs right over here.
Update: SpaceX has provided a statement about this morning’s explosion.
And today in “companies taking their cues from Snapchat” news: Facebook Messenger will begin supporting live video. Now, users will be able to send a video feed to friends with the touch of a button.
Snapchat has had a similar feature since an update back in 2014, and Google’s recently released app Duo also enables users with video-chatting. “Instant Video is a reflection of the ubiquity of video,” Facebook explained, but really this move feels more like a response to the ubiquity of Snapchat — which is quickly becoming the template for all updates on Facebook and its subsidiary, Instagram.

Someone invented a portable water-power generator that can charge your phone. So if you’re in the middle of the wilderness with five hours to sit by a lake or something while it sucks up enough power to charge your phone, you might want to use it.
Mark Zuckerberg, who grows stronger figuratively and physically with each passing solar cycle, was not pleased. He wrote quite the subtweet on Facebook:
Earlier today, a SpaceX rocket exploded in fantastic fashion before it was set to take off from Cape Canaveral this morning. The spacecraft and its payload were both destroyed. Included in that payload was Facebook’s first satellite, which would have provided internet access to parts of Africa.
Look, there are no winners here. Mark Zuckerberg lost a satellite, and SpaceX owner Elon Musk lost a rocket. Both of them are very rich and they’ll be fine so it’s tough to feel sympathy. The residents of sub-Saharan Africa deprived of controversial Facebook-gated internet access will still theoretically be receiving it in the form of laser drones.
At the same time, Mark Zuckerberg might not want to talk too much shit about SpaceX, given their general status as the cheapest private spaceflight company. They’ve held that status since 2012, when Air & Space wrote:
If SpaceX can perfect its reusable rockets, those costs drop lower. So, Zuckerberg could decide to go with a different private space company out of anger and pride, but I don’t think petty looks good on a guy who unilaterally controls the largest social network on the planet.
For older apps developed by one person or smaller teams, this can seem like a hassle. Customers who have already downloaded an app will be able to keep it, it won’t magically disappear from their phone. Still, it might be worth backing up older apps just in case they get taken down. A lot of people still have that one app from 2012 that still looks like iOS 5.
As a part of new guidelines, outlined in a letter today, Apple will make sure older apps follow current guidelines. If they don’t, developers will have 30 days to fix the issue and resubmit. After that, apps will be delisted. In cases where the apps crash on launch, they will be removed from the store immediately.
Apple told app developers today that beginning on September 7, the day that they announce the next iPhone, the company will begin auditing older programs to ensure that they still function properly.
Gizmodo also reports that one of the App Store’s most annoying sales tactics will get curbed slightly. App names will now be limited to 50 characters, hopefully cutting down on the SEO-like, keyword-filled titles that many developers using to rank higher in search results. Think of app titles like “Garblr - Uber for Facebook Memes + Snapchat” (which is fake … for now).
Sometime in the early hours of Friday morning, Apple joined the rest of us internet-using heathens and activated its Twitter. The account, under the handle @Apple, has yet to actually, you know, tweet anything, but has already racked up 131,000 followers. (Not bad engagement.)
This isn’t entirely new; the company has owned the eponymous handle since 2011, Business Insider reports. But today, the handle was given an avatar picture (bye-bye, little egg) and verified. The profile has also been customized with the same colorful, dotted image that was used on the invitations for Apple’s press conference next week, where the company will reportedly unveil the iPhone 7.
Knowing these details, The Wall Street Journal is reporting today that the NX will use cartridges instead of optical discs. At first glance, this can seem like a nostalgia play (Cartridges! Just like your N64 or SNES!), but it’s not really that interesting. That’s because “cartridges” in this case means solid-state memory. Nintendo’s DS and 3DS systems use SD cards to carry games, which technically count as cartridges. If you were hoping to blow in the slot again to get games to work, that ship has sailed. Also, why do you want that?
Using solid-state memory for their next system is really a no-brainer. Optical discs can carry more data, but they need to constantly spin, and they transfer data more slowly — they’re antithetical to the idea of a handheld console.
At some point early next year, Nintendo will announce its next console, code name: the NX. Not much is known about it currently, but long-circulating rumors and reports indicate that it will be a handheld console capable of connecting to a TV. In other words, it won’t match Sony and Microsoft’s consoles in terms of powerhouse graphics or number-crunching capabilities, but it’ll still look good enough to play in your living room.
Nintendo has said it’ll release more info about the mysterious NX later this year.
Perhaps the company will use its newly devised Twitter to livetweet the event. Or maybe this is all some elaborate ruse to create hype and the company will continue its age-old tradition of never tweeting.
Reuters is reporting that Google has killed Project Ara, just months after a May conference in which it had announced plans to ship a developer version this fall. The move is part of a larger attempt at restructuring Google’s hardware efforts, which include Android phones and Chromebook laptops.
For all of the pros of Ara phones — prolonging technology lifespan, reducing waste — there were also cons, such as their bulky form factor.
